So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>, doesn't matter.

No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad.

Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Chinese</span> when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> heard it. They just</br>   threw me in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">North Carolina</span>. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Latino</span>. So, I was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">North Carolina</span> obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Florida</span>. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Florida</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Got it. So, you went to school in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. How far did you study in</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">University</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ELAC</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">East LA College</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I studied philosophy. [Pause] <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ELAC</span>. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I did like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Junior.

Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">30 years old</span>. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ELAC</span> was expensive. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ELAC</span> is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you work in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I did.

Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: In your last job in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20</span> an hour. $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20</span> an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">a thousand</span> a week. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">20,000 pesos</span> a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who did you live with when you lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were you frightened of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you guys send money to relatives in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes.

I'd say like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">10</span> times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: You know, roughly, maybe like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a hundred bucks</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">A hundred dollars</span>.</br>   Which is like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a thousand pesos</span> here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you lived in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">20 years</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Oh yes, absolutely.

Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">The New York Times</span>. They don't sell them here.

That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really.

Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> meat, floating in there [chuckles].

That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">60 something</span> years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three months</span>, we're going to give you <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">13,000 pesos</span>, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Studied?

Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">North Carolina</span> it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I was paying <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">weekly</span>. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">between 2,000 and 5,000</span> a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you feel safe in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: More vulnerable?

Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It was difficult at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Adapting to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Depression. Yes, yes, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first year</span> was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> is the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, I'll be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span></br>   times smarter, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span> times faster, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">ten</span> times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Instead of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">the Virgencita de Guadalupe</span> and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You spent most of your childhood there [in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">many years</span>. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> initiative. That's what <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Itzapalapa</span>, I've been to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tepito</span>. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Roman Catholics</span>. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>,</br>   that you guys are changing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican Americans</span>. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's the difference between dating a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> person and dating an</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Dating an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">African Americans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">white Americans</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Chicanas</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Asian Americans</span>. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, how long's it take a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It doesn't take a while, maybe within <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks</span>. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around two weeks</span></br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you get <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>, but she was this type of feminist <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Malcolm X</span>, coming out of jail became <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Malcolm X.</span></br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span>, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And does that Smokey from LA [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span> laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> kid, who's learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span> [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span>. Even though <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span> is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Nietzche</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sartres</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Heidegger</span>, but</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span>'s not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span> likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>?&quot; &quot;No, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span>, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Boyle Heights</span>?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Evergreen</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">First</span>&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. And they want to perfect their <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, get more</br>   slang and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Smokey</span> has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican Americans</span>, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Heidegger</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Heidegger</span>, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sartre</span>. &quot;Say what is this <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cholo</span> can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cholo</span>, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Foucault</span>. I like to look like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Michel Foucalt</span>, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Foucault</span> and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Heidegger</span>, and</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Nietzsche</span>, and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sartre</span>, and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Foucault</span>. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Ernest Cassirer</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">German</span> philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> in terms of philosophy, right. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I'm trying to read them in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> on the same level as</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span> laughs] if it's not your</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Karl Marx</span> said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Herederos de la Conquista</span>.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Hernan Cortes</span> was the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> conquistador, right now <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">AMLO</span> is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Are you a fan of <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">AMLO</span>?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I'm not a fan of <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">AMLO</span>, but I think that he's more proud of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   and he defends <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and he's not shoe shining the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Joe</span>. Right. Worked for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">the one-percenters.</span></br>   Even in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Guayaberas</span>. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">European</span> image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> in the States, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I do, yes ma'am. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New York Times</span> online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night</span>, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>, born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the   States</span>, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sunday</span> school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>'s loss, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>'s gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and a gain for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: What would I say? I would say that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> is giving to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. It's bad for the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> mentality. What</br>   made <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. These <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> ideas,</br>   putting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> independent from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span> so great, you know, could make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> society, that puts <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. And it's going to be a competition to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>, to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You just gave me my title. Making <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Making <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Language, Cultural, School, Acceptance">Miguel: Ciudad de Mexico. I had a teacher in University that used to say,   &quot;Miguel.‚Äù It's like, &quot;No it's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you   know? That's pretty cool.</span> But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections,  politics, Mexico, The United States"></span>o. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Deportation,  lessons learned"></span>ar, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="politics, Mexican, American"></span>Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Academic, Philosophy"></span>nite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Prison, Prison"></span>o, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Cultural, Reflections, Mexican, American, Philosophy"></span>laying video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican, American,  patriarchy"></span>now, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexican, American,  dating, Age"></span> old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Migrants"></span>uck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Cultural,  pluralism"></span>ou go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Music, Cultural, Reflections"></span> brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections,  ideologies, The United States"></span> to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic"></span>really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="The United States,  news"></span>to,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections,  God, Faith"></span>ply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural"></span>t's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,</br>   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="safety, Mexico"></span>iversity that used to say,</br>   &quot;Miguel.‚Äù It's like, &quot;No it's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,</br>   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Employment, Mexico, Dreams"></span>So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Policy for reintegration, Employment"></span>crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Detention,  Food,  Food"></span>ic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Deportation, Detention"></span>ersity that used to say,</br>   &quot;Miguel.‚Äù It's like, &quot;No it's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,</br>   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Deportation"></span>ing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DACA"></span>at's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Employment, The United States"></span>r/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Language, Learning English, Learning English"></span>el: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reasons, Economic"></span>'re Mexican [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Ciudad de Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Ciudad de Mexico. I had a teacher in University that used to say,</br>   &quot;Miguel.‚Äù It's like, &quot;No it's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,</br>   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Mexico"></span>acher in University that used to say,</br>   &quot;Miguel.‚Äù It's like, &quot;No it's Miguel.&quot; She was Chicana. And she was like,</br>   &quot;No, Miguel.&quot; She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really</br>   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you</br>   know? That's pretty cool. But yes, Miguel, Miguel, doesn't matter. Tomato,</br>   tomato [laughing]. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go to school in Mexico before going to the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How many grades?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Elementary.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you did, what is it? 5th grade?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, 4th grade. 4th grade. And then I finished elementary in</br>   the US.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why did you migrate to the United States? For economic reasons, for</br>   violence, for discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Economic. Absolutely, economic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: To reunite with family?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: To reunite? No. Mostly economic. Economic, that was the main factor</br>   going to the States, according to my dad. I was just a little boy.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How old were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was 8 years old.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you go with a visa or did you cross the border?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I crossed the border on a Greyhound [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for global asylum?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you become a US resident?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: No, I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you speak any English?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nope, no English. Like Chinese when I first heard it. They just</br>   threw me in North Carolina. Just, &quot;All right, good luck.&quot; And nobody spoke</br>   Spanish. I was the only Latino. So, I was the first one to inaugurate ESL</br>   in my school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, stop about that. I'm going to ask you. I'm going to take</br>   notes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was the first one to inaugurate there.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you learned English in the United States, at school?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In school and watching TV and obviously interacting with my</br>   brother. My brother was a big factor. You know, talking to him in English.</br>   That helped a lot. Playing video games, watching shows, that kind of</br>   incremented that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Your English is fluent now. In what cities did you live in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live in North Carolina obviously, then from that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: That was ________, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That was _______ and then you know _______, ________, and then</br>   after that we went to Florida. My dad went to ________. We lived there for</br>   a couple years, I think like five, six years and then we moved to</br>   California. We crossed country on a car from Florida to California, so we</br>   saw all the states and did a little bit tourism, which was pretty cool.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So, you went to school in the US. How far did you study in</br>   the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I went to University. ELAC. East LA College.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What did you study there?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I studied philosophy. [Pause] ELAC. Amazing school.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you get a degree?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Did not get a degree.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So how many years did you go?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did like three years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So you were a junior?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Junior. Did not finish unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you finished your junior year, or?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely. I just didn't finish that. I need to</br>   finish, I'm 30 years old. I need to finish what I started, right</br>   [chuckles]? Which is going to be easier here, right? It's not as expensive.</br>   ELAC was expensive. ELAC is a community college but you still have to pay</br>   money. Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you work in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did since I was 17 years old. I worked for eight years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mainly restaurants and some in construction, but mainly</br>   restaurants.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What work were you doing in restaurants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I started from the bottom and then went to manager. Busboy to</br>   manager all the time. And then a little bit of construction. A little bit</br>   of framing. Carpentry. I got more money for carpentry than in restaurants</br>   as a manager, but that's okay [chuckles]. Almost got my finger chopped off</br>   [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: In your last job in the US, how much did you earn a hour?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much did I earn a hour? I was making $20 an hour. $20 an hour.</br>   I think that's like a thousand, it was a thousand a week. 20,000 pesos a</br>   week. It's not bad. I wish I can make that again [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who did you live with when you lived in the US?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I lived with my father, my mother, my brother and myself. Typical</br>   family, mom, dad, brother and myself. Yes. All the time.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you frightened of the US authorities?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I mean I was. A little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you guys send money to relatives in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. We did.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how many times a year?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How many times a year? I'd say like 10 times a year. My dad was</br>   pretty consistent with that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: About how much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How much each time?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Roughly.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, roughly, maybe like a hundred bucks. A hundred dollars.</br>   Which is like a thousand pesos here, which is not bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you lived in the US for how many years?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: 20 years.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow US political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh yes, absolutely. I love politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How'd you follow it? Family, friends, social media, TV, radio?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The New York Times or reading and talking to folks too. Talking to</br>   folks about politics. Watching the news, mostly the newspaper really. I</br>   love The New York Times. They don't sell them here. They're expensive here.</br>   I love The New York Times, because it's accurate and you know it's not as</br>   prejudice, it's more open. I like it. I think it's more open news. My dream</br>   ‚Äì is maybe one day write an article in that newspaper.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you follow Mexican political news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Nah, I did not. I did not.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you qualify for the Dreamers program, the DACA?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. I did. I kind of screwed that up.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you apply for it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't apply.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Didn't even attempt to do it. I was working, didn't think I was</br>   going to get deported. You know, you think your life's secure and you're</br>   good. You don't need that paper, right, but... That's why I didn't, just</br>   neglect. Really, neglect. [Pause] that's really what it was, neglect.</br>   [Pause] that's my fault, really. I don't regret it though.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What caused you to leave the United States?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What caused me to leave the‚Ä¶ I got deported, I got deported,</br>   unfortunately. I was in the wrong place at the wrong time. Wasn't supposed</br>   to be there. My dad kind of predicted it too‚Äî&quot;Be careful son,‚Äù Cause he</br>   knew that I liked to talk about politics, that was my weakness. Talking</br>   about politics, to the wrong person that has power [chuckles]. That can‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you appear before a judge?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. Not at the time, but later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Were you informed of your rights?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I was, I was.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a lawyer helping you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did not have a lawyer. Unfortunately.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long were you detained for?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: How long? Like three months. Three months detained. The whole</br>   detention, the whole deporting process. Different prisons too. I was in</br>   North Carolina, South Carolina, I was in Georgia and then finally Arizona.</br>   That was the only place they gave good food, chilaquiles [chuckles]. With a</br>   little bit of meat, but it was all right. It wasn't that bad [chuckles].</br>   Eating soy, everything soy, right. Mystery meats, so that was pretty good.</br>   Eating beans as well, because they were trying to get you used to the diet</br>   of Mexico. Yes, because you have a certain diet in prison, you're about to</br>   get released, your stomach's not used to, so you can get sick pretty</br>   easily, so they were trying to get your stomach used to eating beans and</br>   tortillas. You know menudo. They had menudo with a little bit of meat, like</br>   one meat, floating in there [chuckles]. But it was good, it got you used to</br>   the diet here in Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: When I first got here and I ate some tacos al pastor, that was like</br>   being in heaven [chuckles]. Really. That was heaven.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: When you returned to Mexico did any representatives of an</br>   organization greet you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: From Mexican organizations?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes, yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, they gave me a sandwich, a comb.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: A comb?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: A comb [chuckles]. A sandwich and a comb and good luck, if you want</br>   to get a good job [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How long have you been back in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Three years already. It's been three years, yes. It's been rapid.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You lived in Mexico City?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexico City. In one place, _______.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Who do you live with now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I live with my mom, my brother and myself. Soon my dad wants to</br>   come back. That hasn't happened, but we're hoping cause he's already old.</br>   He's like 60 something years old. We don't want him to, you know, sucks to</br>   say this, but to die in the US. I want him to come here and I can take him</br>   to eat. He wants to eat tacos de canasta. He always tells me, &quot;I wanna eat</br>   tacos de canasta. I miss the tacos de canasta.‚Äù You know, so it's pretty</br>   rough for me. But he's living good. I mean he wrote a book, you know that</br>   means he has tranquility and he deserves that after working hard for us so</br>   many years. He deserves to write that book and he already did it, so, makes</br>   me proud, really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Since your return, have you become aware of any programs that helps</br>   poor returning migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I did. My dad even wrote a letter to the governor of Mexico City.</br>   Didn't really do anything, it</br> </br> </br>   was a lot of politics coming back, not doing anything. They gave me a</br>   check. It didn't have any stub. The check was worthless. ‚ÄúYes, come back.</br>   It's going to take three months, we're going to give you 13,000 pesos, so</br>   you can get your business started.‚Äù Didn't happen, it was just too many</br>   politics. It was too hard for me to get it. Too many coming back and forth</br>   and telling me incongruent stories. That's why I started working in call</br>   centers. My idea was to get a school of English, get this money, but that</br>   never happened. So that program is, it just really discourages you from</br>   getting that money. It's just too many, too many doors, too many hoops you</br>   have to jump through. So, it really discouraged me to take that and start‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [The program was] called repatriados. Right? And you do the whole</br>   process, the people are really nice, with a smile. But at the end, there's</br>   no actions, there's no‚ÄîI don't know if you know Spanish, but my grandpa, he</br>   said &quot;De lengua me como tres tacos, hechos.‚Äù Too much tongue, not enough</br>   actions. So it didn't really help me. It didn't help me at all. It sucked.</br>   I needed to work. I was getting money in call centers. I started here in</br>   Teletech, actually.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you studied anything since you've been back?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Studied? No. No, no, no, no, no. Unfortunately, no.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What jobs have you had?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,</br>   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about</br>   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice ‚Ä¶</br>   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was</br>   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.</br>   Maybe I can tell you later on.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Let's do it when we're doing the open recording. Is that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'll tell you the poem that I wrote, but yes just working in</br>   call centers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much do you make? Are you working there now?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Currently, I'm not working. I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty with me. I don't know if he was jealous, but he was just talking too</br>   much smack. It wasn't a good job environment, so I quit. So, right now I'm</br>   looking for a job.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How much were you paid at the last one?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was paying weekly. You know, it varied, it was sales, so it</br>   varied. It depended on commissions. It was between 2,000 and 5,000 a week.</br>   Wasn't that bad.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, you were being paid on commission?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I was being paid on commission. If you didn't make any commission,</br>   you didn't get paid. But I learned Jordan Belfort Straight Line System. And</br>   selling to people, persuading folks to buy time shares [chuckles]. That's</br>   what I was doing and that's when I quit because the guy was being too</br>   nasty.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel safe in Mexico?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do feel safe. Even though people tell me stories, they get</br>   kidnapped or... But I do feel safe.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have not been the victim of a violent crime, yet [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you feel more vulnerable as a returning migrant?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: More vulnerable? [Pause] not really.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Was your return to Mexico difficult?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Extremely difficult.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I'm going to list a couple of things and you tell me. Finding a</br>   job?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It was difficult at first, yes ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are there economic challenges?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You know, paying the rent, without a job, paying light bills, gas</br>   bills. Talking to people and then people saying, &quot;Where you from?&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Language. A little bit of language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And continuing the education?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Continuing the education as well.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family separation?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Family separation. Very big factor.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Family unit or friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Adapting to Mexican culture?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I'm not going to lie. I love Mexican culture, but it was a</br>   little bit hard. Not the nice part of culture, like the art, the dances,</br>   the food and all that, but just being on the metro [chuckles]. Or on the</br>   bus, you know, little things that type of culture [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oh, yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Bureaucratic difficulties? You talked about those, about through</br>   your program assistance, so I guess your basic bureaucracy‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, I did. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How about depression? Did you suffer any of that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Depression. Yes, yes, the first year was kind of depressing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Things happen for a reason. I'm here for a reason, you know. I'm</br>   here to do something. I'm not just here because I'm deported. I'm here</br>   because, you know, I don't know if you believe in God. I do believe in God.</br>   I think God put me here for a reason. Maybe to write a book, maybe to</br>   paint, cause I do see myself in that position. It's a little bit rough</br>   right now, but nobody had it easy. You know that‚Äôs in in a good position</br>   now, so, that's what I'm thinking, you know? I've been stimulated. I've</br>   been more mature here, actually [chuckles]. It's made me more rough. Made</br>   me more rough. More and more attentive. In the US I was kind of pampered.</br>   Because the US is the first world, so you're kind of pampered, you have</br>   everything. Here you become rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They have a saying, &quot;Te crece el callo.‚Äù Callo is callus. You</br>   develop calluses. You know, when you play guitar. And then your fingers get</br>   hard. It doesn't hurt as much, and you play with more facility. It's the</br>   same thing here. I think you develop sort of a social callus. Makes you</br>   stronger, makes you faster. I think if I go back to the States, I'll be ten</br>   times smarter, ten times faster, ten times stronger, in terms of survival,</br>   really. Survival of the fittest because that's what I see here, in the</br>   city. Survival of the fittest [chuckles]. In every direction. That's the</br>   real God of Mexico. Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,</br>   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.</br>   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.</br>   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I</br>   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.</br>   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,</br>   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the</br>   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros</br>   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're</br>   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You spent most of your childhood there [in the US].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped</br>   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently</br>   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I</br>   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence</br>   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she</br>   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For</br>   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their</br>   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the</br>   other side, I just say, &quot;Excuse me, excuse me.‚Äù And my girlfriend gets mad</br>   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid</br>   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of</br>   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an</br>   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,</br>   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].</br>   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged</br>   individualism.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest</br>   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that</br>   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on</br>   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz</br>   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very</br>   inspirational [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about</br>   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up</br>   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody</br>   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,</br>   everybody speaks. The bass player‚Äîit's not only the brass. Some people just</br>   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.</br>   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the</br>   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the</br>   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged</br>   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very</br>   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very</br>   collective.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is collective good?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering</br>   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting</br>   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've</br>   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People</br>   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very</br>   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the</br>   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the</br>   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe</br>   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I</br>   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's</br>   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another</br>   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a</br>   little bit.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think Mexico is less pluralistic?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think so, but there is rare kind of Mexican though.</br>   Maybe not the general public, yes, but there is a rare kind of Mexican that</br>   are pluralistic. But I think, in general they're not. I think in general</br>   they do come with some baggage. They carry baggage. They've been</br>   domesticated. In the States we've been domesticated too, but I guess, if</br>   you're in the right place and you talk to the right people, you can have</br>   this pluralism of having your own world view. I think it's becoming more</br>   plural... pluralistic [struggling to enunciate the word]‚ÄîI can't even talk</br>   right now. Pluralistic, that's a hard word for me, but overall, it's not</br>   that plural, pluralistic.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pluralism mean to you [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pluralism, it's everybody has their own... It comes from post</br>   modernism, right? Everybody has their own truth, there's not an absolute</br>   truth. Your truth is just as valid as the other man's perspective and it‚Äôs</br>   that perspective, ideas of world views. But here, I think since they're</br>   Roman Catholics. I think there's a little bit of that still in the</br>   subconscious of Mexicans. And some‚ÄîI mean it's becoming more pluralistic</br>   nowadays. I do see that, but there's still that baggage of thinking</br>   collectively. That absolute worldview.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that with the return of so many migrants from the US,</br>   that you guys are changing Mexico in any way?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think so. I think, I think so. I see it every day. In terms of</br>   the lingo, in terms of the way people carry themselves. But there's some</br>   sort of hatred as well. I do see it. People who are prepared here, that</br>   have it, you know, college degrees. They went to very good universities.</br>   They see somebody like myself, bald headed‚ÄîI'm not a cholo right? They see</br>   me bald headed, I speak English, they kind of, they see me... There's a lot</br>   of jealousy, right? So, they see you kind of less than them. They start</br>   talking bad about you, stuff like that. But I think, even though, they try</br>   to deny it, they are being influenced. Absolutely. By the arrival of</br>   Mexican Americans. There's no doubt about that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How do you think they're being influenced?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In terms of the lingo and the way they speak. The expressions they</br>   use, the way they carry themselves. That individualism is creeping in</br>   [chuckles]. It's really creeping in. It's unavoidable. It's like champagne</br>   [laughs]. Gives you an acceleration, it's bubbly and very pleasing. Some</br>   try to deny it, some don't. But I do see that, I do see that as changing</br>   though. Mostly the youngsters. Mostly the young people. Some are cool,</br>   like, &quot;You come from the States, that's awesome‚Äù and they try to learn as</br>   much as they can from you. &quot;What did you see, how do you say this, what is</br>   this song saying?&quot;, &quot;Oh it's saying this...&quot; So there's an interaction,</br>   there's a integration really because we date, you know, Mexicans here as</br>   well and, you know, they teach us stuff, we teach them stuff as well. And</br>   so, mostly ourselves [chuckles] we learn a lot from them. How to survive</br>   here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's the difference between dating a Mexican person and dating an</br>   American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Dating an American. There's a lot of differences [chuckles]. Well,</br>   first, Mexican girlfriends, they're very... Well it goes back to the</br>   individualism, right? It all goes back to that. The girlfriends that I had</br>   in the States, very individualistic. You couldn't, you can't dictate what</br>   they have to do. You don't own them. You know? If anything, they own you</br>   [chuckles]. Right? Women are very, very rough. I dated all kinds of races</br>   too. African Americans, white Americans, Chicanas, Asian Americans. They're</br>   all different, but what they do share is this individual, this feminism.</br>   ‚ÄúYou know I have something to say. I'm just as important as you.‚Äù You know</br>   and learning how to compromise here. What I learned from the girlfriends</br>   that I had here is that you can pretty much do whatever you want. Right?</br>   They're not going to demand. Some that are pretty rough, they will demand</br>   stuff, you know they will be very loyal.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: But what I see here is that women are very loyal. They want to,</br>   kind of clean your clothes and cook your dinner. I never had a girl from</br>   the States that's going to cook me some dinner or clean me my clothes. But</br>   yes, the girlfriend's here, they do that [in awe]. Very, with my mom, they</br>   get along though and they're cleaning together, and I don't know. It's very</br>   marriage-oriented mentality, right? Even though you‚Äôre boyfriend and</br>   girlfriend. They see you as their husband really. The way they treat you,</br>   the way I've been treated by the girlfriends here is that, you know, like a</br>   little girl, almost. Taking care of you, it's pretty nice. I like it. I</br>   like the way they treat you here, the Mexican girls.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You like it better?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Do I like it better? I mean, kind of. I kind of like it better. But</br>   I kind of miss somebody, you know, telling me you're kind of fucking up</br>   here, you know [chuckles]. Don't tell me that this is right because this is</br>   wrong. It's good to hear that sometimes. Somebody to critique you. That's</br>   what I like about the American girlfriends. That critique. Right</br>   [chuckles]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, how long's it take a Mexican girlfriend to move into this kind</br>   of, it's a marriage? I understand what you mean metaphorically. Is it</br>   immediate, is it once you're boyfriend, girlfriend and it becomes</br>   familial... or does it take a while?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It doesn't take a while, maybe within two weeks. I mean, not</br>   everybody's the same. The girls that I was dating were like that. You know,</br>   maybe because I was nice. I like to be a gentleman. Very gentleman with</br>   women, you know, open the door and‚ÄîI learned that, to be nice. And I always</br>   tell them, your opinion is very important to me, and you're just as</br>   independent as me. I mean, I'm not better than you, you're not better than</br>   me. We're the same, pretty much the same. But it takes around two weeks</br>   already and you've got them in the bag [laughs].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you get Mexican women to ever tell you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some women, they do. Some women do, they do tell you, you're full</br>   of shit. Mexican women. But it's not very common. I only had one girlfriend</br>   tell me that. She was Mexican, but she was this type of feminist Mexican.</br>   You see, it's very different because there is‚Ä¶I don't know, it is very</br>   different here. It's very crazy. You do have Mexican women with a different</br>   tradition. Maybe the father wasn't around, maybe the father hit their</br>   mother. In this case, her father hit her mother - a very abusive</br>   relationship and her father was an alcoholic. So, she demanded, and she</br>   would tell you if something was wrong, but she would tell you with the</br>   Mexican flavor. Which is different, which is pretty cool, right? Tells you</br>   with the Mexican flavor, but it's very rare to find that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What's a Mexican flavor telling you, you're full of shit?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With cuss words, like ‚Äúno chingas la madre, no!‚Äù ‚Äúeste, Estas alli</br>   sentado hablando ingles todo el dia y te quejas no‚Äù y.. o ‚Äúse despiertan y</br>   tienes que ponerte chingon‚Äù It‚Äôs like holy shit, like I never had somebody</br>   talk to me like that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So is you need to get your act together?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You need to get your act together, but you're saying it nicely</br>   [both laugh]. You're saying it in a very nice way. They say it very</br>   nastily. But it's just to wake you up. That's how their grandmothers</br>   talked. Or you tell them, &quot;Hey, man I kind of messed up in this. It was an</br>   accident‚Äô [mimics voice]. ‚ÄúNo, it's por pendejo.‚Äù It's like, okay. Pendejo,</br>   that's worse than saying stupid. I think pendejo is like the ne plus ultra</br>   of saying stupid to somebody [chuckles]. But that's what I‚Ä¶ but it's very</br>   rare. That's one girlfriend that I had.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is Mexican society more patriarchal or is patriarchal more American?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Pause] I mean traditionally it's patriarchal, right? But I think</br>   that there is a shift. There's been a little bit of a shift. At least the</br>   last girlfriend that I had, her mother was the one that had the pants in</br>   the house. And worked. This is the same father that hit her. But I mean, in</br>   general, we're speaking in general, I think it's more patriarchal than in</br>   the States. Honestly. I mean, if the father's going to buy something, they</br>   have to consult with the wife. You're not going to sell them something, if</br>   they don't consult with the wife. The wife has the final decision, really.</br>   And here it's more patriarchal, but there has been a little bit of a shift,</br>   but it's very rare. It's very small, in general, I think it's more</br>   patriarchal. Right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Have you been able to have these kinds of philosophical</br>   conversations here?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. I talk about philosophy in mercados with old people,</br>   eating food, right? People are very educated here, and you do find people</br>   that can sustain a pretty good conversation. Depends where you go. Depends</br>   where you go, if you have that spirit, you're going to talk about it. But,</br>   yes, you do find spaces where you're eating, you start talking about God,</br>   you start talking about politics, then you turn it to philosophy. And I</br>   love talking about that. I mean it's very nutritious for your brain. You</br>   know and it's usually older folks, that you talk about philosophy. Younger</br>   folks, not so much, maybe I never had the chance to do that. But I had</br>   spaces, I had time to talk about that. People are interested in that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: I've found a lot of people that we've spoken to, who we are speaking</br>   to in the United States that didn't go to college, some got in trouble, you</br>   know. [inaudible] And their reflective capacity, they're philosophers.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, yes, yes. ‚Ä¶ They had a philosophical experience, right? An</br>   extremely philosophical experience, right [chuckles]? An extremely</br>   philosophical experience. That whole being deported is a philosophical</br>   experience, itself, you know. I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to</br>   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the</br>   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.</br>   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an</br>   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different</br>   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is</br>   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important</br>   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,</br>   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces</br>   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some</br>   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from</br>   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the</br>   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen. And</br>   that's pretty amazing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Why do you think that is? That redeeming, why/ how would you explain</br>   it?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, I think it's the necessity, right? It's a radical change,</br>   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this</br>   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be</br>   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come</br>   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also</br>   see the conditions here, which are different.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so</br>   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford</br>   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].</br>   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you</br>   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.</br>   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in</br>   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,</br>   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the</br>   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like</br>   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the</br>   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a</br>   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel</br>   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to</br>   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you</br>   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you</br>   tell yourself, &quot;Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I</br>   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself&quot;. And people do redeem</br>   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: But you're saying that there‚Äôs a positive experience, which is many</br>   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have</br>   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a</br>   criminal‚Äîyou're going to get discriminated‚Äîand then you get a good job like</br>   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working</br>   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA</br>   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is</br>   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like</br>   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.</br>   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about</br>   yourself.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Well, that's what I got here. I mean, I'm speaking from my own</br>   experience, right. That's what I got here. It does feel dignifying. And I</br>   can kind of sense that on people too.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: And does that Smokey from LA [Miguel laughs]‚Ä¶ Sitting beside this</br>   sort of middle-class Mexican kid, who's learned English watching TV and is</br>   trying to practice his English at this call center, do they become friends?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Some of them become friends. Some of them, some don't, but mostly</br>   they become friends. Mostly. Some don't, I say some, because some feel kind</br>   of, they feel bad. I paid a lot of money to get this English. I'm still not</br>   in the same level as Smokey [chuckles]. Right? Not in the same level as</br>   Smokey. Even though Smokey is not a math genius, he has this very good</br>   English. He can connect with an American audience. Then he becomes manager,</br>   you know. There might be some sort of, you know, jealousy, middle class.</br>   Maybe their parents paid their school, some become friends.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I had a lot of friends, sociologists, but that's because of what I</br>   studied, right? So, we would talk about Nietzche, Sartres, Heidegger, but</br>   Smokey's not going to talk about that. Right, he's going to talk about</br>   something else. Usually, Smokey likes to talk about how many beers he's</br>   going to drink after he leaves the office. You know, about his girlfriend,</br>   about his experience here in Mexico, you know, or what happened in the</br>   metro. Hey, You know, &quot;Somebody just stepped on my shoes, they didn't say</br>   sorry, man you believe that, Miguel?&quot; &quot;No, Smokey, that really happen to</br>   you, man?&quot; Didn't say sorry, you know, stuff like that. They like to talk</br>   about stuff that happened here and how it's different. I love hanging out</br>   with them and talking about life and you get this solidarity, and it feels</br>   good. It makes me feel good.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: &quot;Smokey, you knew the joker from Boyle Heights?&quot; &quot;Yes, man, I used</br>   to live on Evergreen and First&quot;, &quot;No way, man, I used to live there too.‚Äù</br>   So, you start a conversation, it feels good. And they can't relate with</br>   people that studied here, right? But they relate in a way ‚Äòcause they want</br>   to learn more English. And they want to perfect their English, get more</br>   slang and Smokey has that available to them. You know, makes them look cool</br>   too. In front of their friends too, right? It's like, I learned this slang.</br>   So, you, some become friends, and some don't. I think it's mixed.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Between jealousy and some are like, &quot;Okay, I want to learn&quot;.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Is the call center, I'm trying to understand, is it a place where,</br>   there's less‚Äîon the streets is it harder?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: If you come back from the states, is there discrimination?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes. Yes, absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What does pocho mean?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Pocho, it's an insult. Since I studied existentialism, I make fun</br>   of myself. I learned to make fun of myself and to embrace my imperfections.</br>   Some people tell me, &quot;That‚Äôs not how you pronounce it.‚Äù I say I'm pocho.</br>   Pocho means you don't know how to pronounce Spanish correctly, so you say,</br>   &quot;Vamos a parquear el carro&quot;. It's words that are mixed with English.</br>   Parquear it‚Äôs not parking, it's estacionar. [chuckles].</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They discriminate what we do. You know, they kind of took that away</br>   from me though here, because I was, I'd been less pocho. Not so much, but</br>   less pocho. So instead of saying, &quot;Bring me la tuna.‚Äù Tuna you know, the</br>   fish, right? But tuna, it's a fruit here. You have to say atun. Like,</br>   &quot;Bring me the atun.‚Äù No. &quot;Me, me voy a entunar.‚Äù It‚Äôs like ‚ÄúNo no, como te</br>   entunas ‚Äì te vas a entonar.‚Äù So I'm, you know, it helps you. Having a</br>   girlfriend helps. If you have a girlfriend that can correct that, they can</br>   correct it in a nice way. Some people don't, some people see you as</br>   ignorant. That you don't know how to speak Spanish. But pocho, yes, I'm</br>   pocho. I'm a little bit pocho. I'm not going to lie.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in this call center, it's a place where the discrimination goes</br>   away, what you see on the streets, or is there still discrimination between</br>   the pochos and the non-pochos?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I think it's not as intense. I think people start adapting in a</br>   call center. Because the majority are Mexican Americans, deportees, the</br>   majority. So, they get accustomed and they get used to it. And the streets</br>   are more, they're a little more rough.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Do you think, this is another stupid sort of reflection question...</br>   So do you sit in the call centers talking to the kids who are educated here</br>   about Heidegger?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Heidegger, Sartre. &quot;Say what is this Cholo can speak about this?&quot;,</br>   &quot;I'm not Cholo, man.&quot; I know I like being bald headed, you know because I</br>   like Foucault. I like to look like Michel Foucalt, right [chuckles]? He's a</br>   bald-headed guy too, right? With glasses. I wear glasses, myself, too. But</br>   yes, I speak about Foucault and immediately they can detect that‚Äî</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, wait a minute, they hear you talking about Heidegger, and</br>   Nietzsche, and Sartre, and Foucault. That must blow their mind --</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: [Chuckles] because they expect you not to talk about that. I say,</br>   &quot;Well, you're actually educated. Nice then We can talk, right?‚Äù Yes, but I</br>   mean it is a surprise, though, to them. Especially when I refer them to</br>   books that I read before. Or even like tell them philosophers they never</br>   heard before. Right, like Ernest Cassirer, German philosopher, they haven't</br>   heard about him. So it is exciting to them and it kind of gives me a pass.</br>   It kind of does give me a little bit of a pass because I have something to</br>   talk about, right. And I have an idea. It's a little bit harder for me to</br>   express myself with their ideas in Spanish because of the terminology,</br>   because I read all of this in English. So my terminology, you know, I try</br>   to translate. It's a little bit hard. I'm kind of in a crutch when I'm</br>   speaking in Spanish in terms of philosophy, right. In English, you know, I</br>   can express myself pretty good, those ideas because I read it in English.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm trying to read them in Spanish. Which is a little bit hard</br>   because of the words. There are complicated words in Spanish. But that's</br>   actually another goal of mine. To develop Spanish on the same level as</br>   English. Spanish is slightly on the bottom.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: These concepts, it‚Äôs hard stuff [Miguel laughs] if it's not your</br>   first language.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am. Absolutely. But I'm pushing myself, forcing myself.</br>   It's hard, it's like a mountain, but it's like Karl Marx said, right? In</br>   The Capital, the beginning pages, introduction, he was saying that there is</br>   no golden road to science. You got to climb and when you climb it, you</br>   overcome the fatigue of climbing, you will get to the summit. And you will</br>   enjoy that beautiful view. But first you need to climb the mountain, right?</br>   I'm kind of paraphrasing what he said, but it's along those lines of</br>   climbing a mountain and overcoming the fatigue. That's what I'm doing. It</br>   is very fatiguing to read in Spanish, but I want to get to that summit and</br>   be able to express myself good in Spanish. It's important for me because I</br>   want to study here. Spanish, or not Spanish, but study here, finish what I</br>   started.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Philosophy. It's not going to give me anything. Maybe I won't</br>   become rich, but I finished that. I finished something that I love. I'm not</br>   in it for the money. You don't need to be smart to have money or you don't</br>   need to have a career to have money. You know, I can open a juice stand and</br>   become a philosopher. It doesn't matter to me [chuckles]. As long as I get</br>   the career in. And mainly write, I want to become a writer.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a family of writers. My dad's a writer, my uncle's a writer.</br>   My uncle writes books. Maybe I'll bring a book to you. It's not that hard,</br>   it's a small one. He likes to condense his books. He's into simplicity and</br>   it's called ‚ÄúLos Herederos de la Conquista.‚ÄùAnd there's not a lot of</br>   sophisticated terminology. He made it for the public, so they can read it.</br>   Basically, what he's saying in that book is that if Hernan Cortes was the</br>   first conquistador, right now AMLO is the last conquistador and that the</br>   conquest was inherited. That it was inherited and the same demons that made</br>   the Mexican empire collapse, is making us still being conquered. We're</br>   still being conquered. He wrote that book and many others, so... That's my</br>   dream.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Are you a fan of AMLO?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I'm not a fan of AMLO, but I think that he's more proud of Mexico</br>   and he defends Mexico and he's not shoe shining the American boots, as the</br>   other... Kind of shoe shining, but not too much. Right? He did speak back</br>   to Trump a little bit. Right, he spoke diplomatically‚Ä¶.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Trump is a populist. Populism is winning right now. That's my fear.</br>   Populism is winning. But that's because of the defects of capitalism. It</br>   hasn't worked for the average Joe. Right. Worked for the one-percenters.</br>   Even in the US. Right and I'm not a big fan of... I did vote for him [AMLO]</br>   because he was wearing Guayaberas. He was more proud of... So in terms of</br>   an image, in terms of the image, I like the image that he was presenting.</br>   That's why I voted for him. The other image was more, they were into this</br>   European image. You know, I like the fact that he's... and he's talking</br>   about Neoliberalism. I'm not a big fan of Neoliberalism, as well. Or</br>   privatization. So, I kind of like that, his rhetoric. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: He is educated, actually the way he speaks to him, he's educating</br>   Trump and speaking rough to him, like a father would speak to a son. That's</br>   how he's speaking and he's very intelligent. He's also letting him know of</br>   the importance of Mexicans in the States, in the United States, in the</br>   U.S., right. But it's still kind of premature, no, right? His candidacy.</br>   I'm hoping that he would do something great. Right, because Mexico deserves</br>   it. But you know, you never know. Maybe I'll be the next president. Right?</br>   Maybe I'll do something about it, right?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Okay, I have a few more questions. Do you currently follow US news?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I do, yes ma'am. New York Times online. Not free though. [chuckles]</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: There's one more thing that I want to ask you about today.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: What happened to get you deported?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: I have a bottle of gin right here. [chuckles] No. Okay, so I was in</br>   a mall. I was a little bit drunk, I started talking about politics to the</br>   wrong people. The police came. They were military. They told the...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They were military?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: They were military guys. I was speaking to them. We were just</br>   speaking about politics and I was just telling...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Where were you?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: In the mall. And I was just telling them how I respect what they</br>   do, but they're an oppressive apparatus.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: They're an ... a what?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Oppressive apparatus. That's the word that I used. The exact word</br>   that I used before I got deported. I told, &quot;You know, I respect what you</br>   do. You know, you don't know, but you are an oppressive apparatus. You do</br>   realize that, right?&quot; And they're like, &quot;No, you know&quot;, very patriotic.</br>   &quot;No&quot; and this and that and you kind of smell like alcohol. I'm just going</br>   to leave. I left. Right before coming outside, the police were there and</br>   were like, &quot;Hey, we had some complaints that you were bothering folks here.</br>   You were bothering fellow military&quot;, you know, &quot;Let me search you&quot;. I had a</br>   bottle of gin. Stupid. That's me.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Word for word.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I had a bottle of gin -- he saw it, &quot;Hey, you're coming</br>   downtown with me&quot;. And I told him, &quot;Well, if you do this, there will be a</br>   lot of repercussions that you don't understand what's going to happen&quot;. I</br>   was already warning him, I'm going to get deported. I told him the whole</br>   picture, &quot;I'm going to separate from my mom, you know. Just so you can keep</br>   that in mind&quot;. Because police officers can use their judgment and I had</br>   police officers that let me go. This guy was a rookie. This guy was into</br>   his job. &quot;I'm just trying to do my job&quot;. And then I got pissed off and I</br>   told him, &quot;I hope you can sleep well at night, because you don't understand</br>   what's going to happen. You really do not understand the gravity of this&quot;.</br>   So, yes, I went to ICE, born in Mexico, now I'm here because of that.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not listening to my dad. My dad told me not to go outside. Because</br>   he knew that I was very -- I like to speak about politics. I like to speak</br>   about politics, and you can get in trouble. You can get deported. He told</br>   me that, those exact same words.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: He told you not to go outside? What do you mean? Told you not to go</br>   and get drunk or [inaudible 01:04:41]?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Not go outside... Well, he kind of knew what I was going to do,</br>   right? It was my day off. He knew I was going to drink some alcohol and</br>   maybe be loose with my tongue, right? And that's exactly what happened.</br>   Didn't go to a bar, went to a store, drank a little bit. Made me feel good.</br>   I wasn't being aggressive with anybody. So, you know, I was kind of ... I</br>   drank, but I wasn't aggressive. I was just more talkative than anything.</br>   Very talkative. You know, it's kind of weird, you know. But, yes, that's</br>   what happened, and you know I drank alcohol. A little bit tipsy. I talked</br>   to these military people, got them pissed off, they called the police,</br>   police got me, they found an open container, ‚ÄúLet's go to downtown‚Äù.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: That's why I'm here, because of alcohol. Mostly not because of</br>   alcohol, I think mostly because of, you know, being in the wrong place at</br>   the wrong time. I drank alcohol in bars and spoke to people, they were</br>   pretty rational, and we had some very nice conversations in the bar. You</br>   know, I learned a lot.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe telling a vet that he was part of an oppressive state...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Right, a veteran. Yes, that's true. That was my bad. [chuckles]</br>   Right? Now in retrospect, it's like, yes, you shouldn't do that, you know.</br>   There's no need for you to tell them that. Maybe that's a conversation you</br>   need to have with a professor of a university or maybe like yourself, you</br>   know. But not a veteran because that... Are you a veteran yourself?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: No, but I'm a professor of a university.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: You're a professor of university, okay, so maybe that's a good</br>   conversation with somebody that maybe has that same idea. Right? [chuckles]</br>   But not to a veteran, right? I feel...</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Maybe not, if you're undocumented.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Exactly, what was I thinking, right? But I thought I was the king</br>   of the world.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: With a bottle of gin.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: With a bottle of gin. But just so you can know the level of</br>   confidence that I had. My parents were thinking about, &quot;No, you know you</br>   can get deported. Be careful&quot;. Very careful. I wasn't careful. I was too</br>   confident. I thought that being deported was the last thing that was going</br>   to happen to me. And it happened to me. Somebody that took advantage in the</br>   States, went to university, you know, was a good student, you know. Did</br>   really good, I was a Sunday school teacher, as well. And had very good</br>   conversations with people, but anybody can get deported. You have to follow</br>   the rules, right, you know. I would tell people not to do that, if you're</br>   living there undocumented. Try to do the right thing.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, I have one more question for you.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes, ma'am.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Kind of a reflection and then I'll let you go. [I‚Äôd like to write</br>   about] the US's loss, Mexico's gain. By deporting people is a loss for the</br>   US and a gain for Mexico.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How would you write that piece? What would you say?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: What would I say? I would say that the US is giving to Mexico human</br>   capital for free. Right? Giving human capital for free because of</br>   irrational politics. Because of politics, because of politics that might</br>   have some sort of racist undertones. I don't know. They're deporting human</br>   capital, they're I guess just giving away money to Mexico, right? Human</br>   capital. That's very strange. They're deporting human capital. They're</br>   giving, they're importing these great assets for free. Which is good, for</br>   Mexico. It's bad for the US. But because of this backward politics.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: So, I would paint something. I would paint a picture of that. You</br>   know, this kind of caveman. I would paint a caveman and then just throwing</br>   away dollars to Mexico, right or something. Something along those lines,</br>   you know of backward politics not realizing that they're deporting human</br>   capital.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: So, in that human capital, are we talking, we're talking about</br>   people who are, like people who speak English. What about the values they</br>   come back with? Those experiences, is this something that Mexico gains from</br>   its migrants?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Absolutely.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: How, can you talk just a little bit about that?</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Yes ma'am. On the inside in terms of the American mentality. What</br>   made America so good? Entrepreneurs. Entrepreneurship, that hands on, that</br>   being proud of your country, putting Mexico first. These American ideas,</br>   putting Mexico first, innovation, innovating, insight, you can potentially</br>   make Mexico independent from the US and not shining their boots anymore.</br>   You know, if you have these young people getting into these... But the</br>   thing is, getting them into this, you know, political atmosphere. Getting</br>   them interested in this.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: And Mexico could be fundamentally changed. It could be another</br>   America, or even better. And I think it could be a little bit better.</br>   Because we have both worlds, right? But yes, we're bringing insight. What</br>   made America so great, you know, could make Mexico great again, because we</br>   bring the ideas. The ideas are what's important really. The abstract, the</br>   intangible. That's what solidifies eventually into something. And it can</br>   solidify into an independent, pluralistic Mexican society, that puts Mexico</br>   first. And it's going to be a competition to America, to the US, you know.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: You just gave me my title. Making Mexico great again.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Miguel: Making Mexico great again. There you go, there's the title right</br>   there. [chuckles] Awesome.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Anita: Thank you so much.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
