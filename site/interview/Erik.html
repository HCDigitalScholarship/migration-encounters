So, let's talk a little bit more about some of the things</br>   that sort of are here. So why in the middle of a psychology degree did you</br>   decide to go to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>? Why did you give up your studies?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Because right here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, you can have a degree, you can have an</br>   education, but you don't get paid for. I used to make the same kind of</br>   money being just a laborer or working in a factory. You know? And it's not</br>   that I don't like to be a psychologist, it's just that economics is a big</br>   motivation to keep studying. You know what I mean? And well, I don't</br>   volunteer, but I've been working a lot of psychology issues like assisting</br>   people working on rehab centers. Like, NA, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Narcotics Anonymous</span>. And being</br>   listen their problems, and talking to them, and tell them how I left the</br>   drug issues and all that. So I just get tired of psychology, you know?</br>   [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Because you're working with people as a psychotherapist.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: You're right but getting <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> point of a good therapy is just tell you</br>   have to take your own decisions, man. I just don't understand your feet on</br>   the ground, man. I mean, cheer up. You got to take your own decisions.</br>   That's basically what a therapist would tell you. You need to make your own</br>   decisions. So, there's not much I can do. That's why I don't see much hope</br>   in the therapy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Because at the end, every person need to reinvent themselves and make</br>   their own decisions. The good, the bad. You know? I don't know if that</br>   makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No, it does make sense. Did you like living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yeah, I like the region. I just lived <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. It has like mix of</br>   modern and the country.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.</br>   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a</br>   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in</br>   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.</br>   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, the outdoors?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: The outdoors, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Is there anything else you miss?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing</br>   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you ever face discrimination in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Of course. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: From who?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: From who? Tell me about that a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about</br>   discriminations just talk about [inaudible <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">22:26</span>], people with narrow mind.</br>   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span>. It could be</br>   people from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">India</span>. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my</br>   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span>. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. People discriminate <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Indians</span>, or not in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">USA</span> and say that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People</br>   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because</br>   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.</br>   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you</br>   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,</br>   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody</br>   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> You know?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Here, in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span> people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: In the case like, I don't know the word in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> but in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying? And that is very different between <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> and another culture.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. And that's something you liked about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's</br>   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You</br>   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile</br>   even though when I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: You know, I like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that</br>   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay</br>   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right</br>   now, I live in a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span>-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.</br>   In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">U.S.</span>, I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even</br>   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that</br>   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a</br>   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay</br>   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you</br>   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I was on my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">AA</span> meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. But, were you living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Maryland</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Maryland</span> license?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yep. But, if you go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Maryland</span></br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Got it. So then, he turned you over to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you said you would think about going back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: On the <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Obama</span>'s presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Doritos</span>. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Republican</span>,</br>   or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Democrat</span>. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a whole   year</span> like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">months</span>. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.</br>   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> chances to marry, I</br>   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span></br>   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">French</span> philosopher?</br>   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.</br>   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.</br>   The same of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But we're trying... Our project is to try to allow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> to hear</br>   the voices of migrants.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Well, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> who’s going to hear that is the ones who want to</br>   hear. But I don't think <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I see.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: You know, more likely to be on a real scenario.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Right.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: But what I will tell them, like, “Wah, do not punish me.” No, I mean</br>   I don't cry. I pay my dues.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. And what would you tell the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government, and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   society about the way they treat returning migrants, and what they should</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government, what I would tell them, not about the</br>   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the</br>   conquerors until <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">today</span>, they come to administrate the government and only</br>   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the</br>   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the</br>   immigrants, society. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?</br>   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span> and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: trades?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: The trades from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Bucareli</span>. It's like a secret treatise where <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span></br>   government do not let the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government to be self-sufficient over the</br>   country. So we can’t. I would say cancel those treatments because they</br>   belong to secrecy and develop the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> country. We don't have to be and</br>   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. But do you think, as someone who has lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>, you bring something that could help <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? Just, your experience</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, has that changed you in a way that you can contribute</br>   positively to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and to the kind of changes you've outlined that</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> needs? And people like you, who've had that experience in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: I do not get your question.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: As somebody who has lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> and has had these</br>   experiences that you've had in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, do you think that you</br>   have a contribution to make here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>? What do you bring to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: What? What I do bring to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes. Special skills, or knowledge, or... How has that experience</br>   changed you in ways that would be good for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> to say, “Yes, migrants</br>   are a good resource?”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> or for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Well I don't know. I just take care of myself. My contribution is</br>   what I would learn from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, just take care of myself. Be</br>   responsible for myself. I mean, and it's how society change. And it's</br>   how—you ever read <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melody Beattie</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: Well, I suggest if you found a book from <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Melody Beattie</span>, he basically</br>   teach, write about a lot of co-dependency.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Uh-huh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you</br>   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,</br>   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span>: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of</br>   myself. If I want to do a contribution to my city, I need to start for</br>   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do</br>   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.</br>   Besides contribute, do not be a load, or do not be a charge.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, you've brought self-sufficiency, you'd say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Erik</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic, Education, Mexico, School,  Psychology">Erik: Because right here in Mexico, you can have a degree, you can have an   education, but you don't get paid for. I used to make the same kind of   money being just a laborer or working in a factory. You know? And it's not   that I don't like to be a psychologist, it's just that economics is a big   motivation to keep studying. You know what I mean? And well, I don't   volunteer, but I've been working a lot of psychology issues like assisting   people working on rehab centers. Like, NA, Narcotics Anonymous. And being   listen their problems, and talking to them, and tell them how I left the   drug issues and all that. So I just get tired of psychology, you know?   [Laughs].    </span> Anita: Because you're working with people as a psychotherapist.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You're right but getting one point of a good therapy is just tell you</br>   have to take your own decisions, man. I just don't understand your feet on</br>   the ground, man. I mean, cheer up. You got to take your own decisions.</br>   That's basically what a therapist would tell you. You need to make your own</br>   decisions. So, there's not much I can do. That's why I don't see much hope</br>   in the therapy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Because at the end, every person need to reinvent themselves and make</br>   their own decisions. The good, the bad. You know? I don't know if that</br>   makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No, it does make sense. Did you like living in the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, I like the region. I just lived Georgia. It has like mix of</br>   modern and the country.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.</br>   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a</br>   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in</br>   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.</br>   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, the outdoors?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The outdoors, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is there anything else you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing</br>   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever face discrimination in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of course. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who? Tell me about that a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about</br>   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.</br>   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be</br>   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my</br>   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in the United States,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about USA and say that the first country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People</br>   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because</br>   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the U.S. changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.</br>   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you</br>   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,</br>   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody</br>   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the U.S. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here, in the U.S. people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the U.S. people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish</br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying? And that is very different between one and another culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And that's something you liked about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's</br>   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You</br>   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile</br>   even though when I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, I like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that</br>   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay</br>   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right</br>   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.</br>   In the U.S., I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even</br>   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that</br>   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a</br>   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay</br>   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you</br>   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. But, were you living in Maryland?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a Maryland license?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So then, he turned you over to ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances three times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.</br>   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I</br>   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump</br>   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?</br>   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.</br>   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.</br>   The same of Mexican people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But we're trying... Our project is to try to allow Americans to hear</br>   the voices of migrants.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, the Americans who’s going to hear that is the ones who want to</br>   hear. But I don't think Trump supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, more likely to be on a real scenario.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: But what I will tell them, like, “Wah, do not punish me.” No, I mean</br>   I don't cry. I pay my dues.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And what would you tell the Mexican government, and Mexican</br>   society about the way they treat returning migrants, and what they should</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The Mexican government, what I would tell them, not about the</br>   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the</br>   conquerors until today, they come to administrate the government and only</br>   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the</br>   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the</br>   immigrants, society. Mexico is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?</br>   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to the United</br>   States and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: trades?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The trades from Bucareli. It's like a secret treatise where American</br>   government do not let the Mexican government to be self-sufficient over the</br>   country. So we can’t. I would say cancel those treatments because they</br>   belong to secrecy and develop the Mexican country. We don't have to be and</br>   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. But do you think, as someone who has lived in the United</br>   States, you bring something that could help Mexico? Just, your experience</br>   in the United States, has that changed you in a way that you can contribute</br>   positively to Mexico, and to the kind of changes you've outlined that</br>   Mexico needs? And people like you, who've had that experience in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I do not get your question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As somebody who has lived in the United States and has had these</br>   experiences that you've had in the United States, do you think that you</br>   have a contribution to make here in Mexico? What do you bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: What? What I do bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. Special skills, or knowledge, or... How has that experience</br>   changed you in ways that would be good for Mexico to say, “Yes, migrants</br>   are a good resource?”</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans or for Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well I don't know. I just take care of myself. My contribution is</br>   what I would learn from United States, just take care of myself. Be</br>   responsible for myself. I mean, and it's how society change. And it's</br>   how—you ever read Melody Beattie?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, I suggest if you found a book from Melody Beattie, he basically</br>   teach, write about a lot of co-dependency.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Uh-huh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, What the US has lost, Reflections, Mexico, What Mexico has gained">Erik: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.     Anita: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.     Erik: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of   myself. If I want to do a contribution to my city, I need to start for   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.

But I don't think Trump supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Court Proceedings, Judge, Case">Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me   over to immigration center.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Documents, Social security card/ ID">Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland   license.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Living situation">Erik: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.   In the U.S., I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big   deal.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Feelings, Frustration">Erik: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile   even though when I don't want to.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm   saying? And that is very different between one and another culture.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Call Centers">Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,   you know? Or you have just different customs.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Being secretive, Hiding/lying, In the shadows">Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my   chin up.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination/stigmatization">Erik: Of course. Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Favorite parts">Erik: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs/employment/work">Erik: You're right but getting one point of a good therapy is just tell you   have to take your own decisions, man. I just don't understand your feet on   the ground, man. I mean, cheer up. You got to take your own decisions.   That's basically what a therapist would tell you. You need to make your own   decisions. So, there's not much I can do. That's why I don't see much hope   in the therapy, you know?    </span> Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Because at the end, every person need to reinvent themselves and make</br>   their own decisions. The good, the bad. You know? I don't know if that</br>   makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No, it does make sense. Did you like living in the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, I like the region. I just lived Georgia. It has like mix of</br>   modern and the country.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.</br>   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a</br>   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in</br>   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.</br>   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, the outdoors?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The outdoors, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is there anything else you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing</br>   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever face discrimination in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of course. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who? Tell me about that a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about</br>   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.</br>   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be</br>   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my</br>   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in the United States,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about USA and say that the first country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman.

Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the U.S. changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all.

I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the U.S. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here, in the U.S. people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the U.S. people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish</br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying?

Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. But, were you living in Maryland?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a Maryland license?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So then, he turned you over to ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances three times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Broken system, Time in the US, Mexico">Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.   The same of Mexican people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Ice, Treatment by, Arrests, Police: US, Racial profiling, Immigration status, Discrimination, Deportation, Ice, Fear of, Detention, Court Proceedings, Judge">Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to   court, supposed to be... Justice, no?

[Laughs]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Police, Arrests, Traffic Offenses, Immigration Offenses, Racial profiling">Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?   What's the story?     Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Discrimination">Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Pastimes, Hiking, Fishing, Running/exercising, Art">Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="States, Georgia">Erik: Yeah, I like the region. I just lived Georgia. It has like mix of   modern and the country.    </span> Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.</br>   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a</br>   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in</br>   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.</br>   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, the outdoors?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The outdoors, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is there anything else you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing</br>   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever face discrimination in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of course. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who? Tell me about that a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about</br>   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.</br>   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be</br>   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my</br>   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in the United States,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about USA and say that the first country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People</br>   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because</br>   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the U.S. changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.</br>   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you</br>   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,</br>   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody</br>   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the U.S. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here, in the U.S. people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the U.S. people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish</br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying? And that is very different between one and another culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And that's something you liked about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's</br>   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You</br>   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile</br>   even though when I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, I like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that</br>   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay</br>   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right</br>   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.</br>   In the U.S., I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even</br>   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that</br>   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a</br>   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay</br>   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you</br>   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. But, were you living in Maryland?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a Maryland license?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So then, he turned you over to ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances three times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.</br>   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I</br>   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump</br>   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?</br>   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.</br>   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.</br>   The same of Mexican people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But we're trying... Our project is to try to allow Americans to hear</br>   the voices of migrants.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, the Americans who’s going to hear that is the ones who want to</br>   hear. But I don't think Trump supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, more likely to be on a real scenario.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: But what I will tell them, like, “Wah, do not punish me.” No, I mean</br>   I don't cry. I pay my dues.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And what would you tell the Mexican government, and Mexican</br>   society about the way they treat returning migrants, and what they should</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The Mexican government, what I would tell them, not about the</br>   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the</br>   conquerors until today, they come to administrate the government and only</br>   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the</br>   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the</br>   immigrants, society. Mexico is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?</br>   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to the United</br>   States and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: trades?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The trades from Bucareli. It's like a secret treatise where American</br>   government do not let the Mexican government to be self-sufficient over the</br>   country. So we can’t. I would say cancel those treatments because they</br>   belong to secrecy and develop the Mexican country. We don't have to be and</br>   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. But do you think, as someone who has lived in the United</br>   States, you bring something that could help Mexico? Just, your experience</br>   in the United States, has that changed you in a way that you can contribute</br>   positively to Mexico, and to the kind of changes you've outlined that</br>   Mexico needs? And people like you, who've had that experience in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I do not get your question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As somebody who has lived in the United States and has had these</br>   experiences that you've had in the United States, do you think that you</br>   have a contribution to make here in Mexico? What do you bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: What? What I do bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. Special skills, or knowledge, or... How has that experience</br>   changed you in ways that would be good for Mexico to say, “Yes, migrants</br>   are a good resource?”</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans or for Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well I don't know. I just take care of myself. My contribution is</br>   what I would learn from United States, just take care of myself. Be</br>   responsible for myself. I mean, and it's how society change. And it's</br>   how—you ever read Melody Beattie?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, I suggest if you found a book from Melody Beattie, he basically</br>   teach, write about a lot of co-dependency.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Uh-huh.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you</br>   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,</br>   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of</br>   myself. If I want to do a contribution to my city, I need to start for</br>   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do</br>   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.</br>   Besides contribute, do not be a load, or do not be a charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, from the US, you've brought self-sufficiency, you'd say?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I would say, yes.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
