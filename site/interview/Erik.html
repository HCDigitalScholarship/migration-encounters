   education, but you don't get paid for. I used to make the same kind of<br>
   money being just a laborer or working in a factory. You know? And it's not<br>
   that I don't like to be a psychologist, it's just that economics is a big<br>
   motivation to keep studying. You know what I mean? And well, I don't<br>
   volunteer, but I've been working a lot of psychology issues like assisting<br>
   people working on rehab centers. Like, NA, Narcotics Anonymous. And being<br>
   listen their problems, and talking to them, and tell them how I left the<br>
   drug issues and all that. So I just get tired of psychology, you know?<br>
   [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Because you're working with people as a psychotherapist.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You're right but getting one point of a good therapy is just tell you</br>   have to take your own decisions, man. I just don't understand your feet on</br>   the ground, man. I mean, cheer up. You got to take your own decisions.</br>   That's basically what a therapist would tell you. You need to make your own</br>   decisions. So, there's not much I can do. That's why I don't see much hope</br>   in the therapy, you know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Because at the end, every person need to reinvent themselves and make</br>   their own decisions. The good, the bad. You know? I don't know if that</br>   makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No, it does make sense. Did you like living in the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, I like the region. I just lived Georgia. It has like mix of</br>   modern and the country.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.</br>   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a</br>   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in</br>   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.</br>   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, the outdoors?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The outdoors, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Is there anything else you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. The last town, you know? You don't be so anxious about losing</br>   your job, or you don't feel too much pressure about that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you ever face discrimination in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of course. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Huh?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: From who? Tell me about that a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about</br>   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.</br>   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be</br>   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my</br>   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in the United States,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about USA and say that the first country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People</br>   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because</br>   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the U.S. changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.</br>   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you</br>   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,</br>   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody</br>   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the U.S. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here, in the U.S. people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the U.S. people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish</br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying? And that is very different between one and another culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And that's something you liked about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's</br>   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You</br>   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile</br>   even though when I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, I like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that</br>   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay</br>   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right</br>   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.</br>   In the U.S., I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even</br>   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that</br>   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a</br>   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay</br>   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you</br>   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. But, were you living in Maryland?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a Maryland license?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So then, he turned you over to ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances three times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.</br>   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I</br>   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump</br>   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?</br>   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.</br>   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.</br>   The same of Mexican people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But we're trying... Our project is to try to allow Americans to hear</br>   the voices of migrants.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, the Americans who’s going to hear that is the ones who want to</br>   hear. But I don't think Trump supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, more likely to be on a real scenario.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: But what I will tell them, like, “Wah, do not punish me.” No, I mean</br>   I don't cry. I pay my dues.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And what would you tell the Mexican government, and Mexican</br>   society about the way they treat returning migrants, and what they should</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The Mexican government, what I would tell them, not about the</br>   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the</br>   conquerors until today, they come to administrate the government and only</br>   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the</br>   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the</br>   immigrants, society. Mexico is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?</br>   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to the United</br>   States and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: trades?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The trades from Bucareli. It's like a secret treatise where American</br>   government do not let the Mexican government to be self-sufficient over the</br>   country. So we can’t. I would say cancel those treatments because they</br>   belong to secrecy and develop the Mexican country. We don't have to be and</br>   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. But do you think, as someone who has lived in the United</br>   States, you bring something that could help Mexico? Just, your experience</br>   in the United States, has that changed you in a way that you can contribute</br>   positively to Mexico, and to the kind of changes you've outlined that</br>   Mexico needs? And people like you, who've had that experience in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I do not get your question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As somebody who has lived in the United States and has had these</br>   experiences that you've had in the United States, do you think that you</br>   have a contribution to make here in Mexico? What do you bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: What? What I do bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. Special skills, or knowledge, or... How has that experience</br>   changed you in ways that would be good for Mexico to say, “Yes, migrants</br>   are a good resource?”</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans or for Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well I don't know. I just take care of myself. My contribution is</br>   what I would learn from United States, just take care of myself. Be</br>   responsible for myself. I mean, and it's how society change. And it's</br>   how—you ever read Melody Beattie?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, I suggest if you found a book from Melody Beattie, he basically</br>   teach, write about a lot of co-dependency.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Uh-huh.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="156cf7c1-462b-430a-bb26-50d7c57ec4a5" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, What the US has lost, Reflections, Mexico, What Mexico has gained">Erik: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you<br>
   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,<br>
   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Erik: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of<br>

   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do<br>
   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.<br>

And all those</br>   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.</br>   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].</br>   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the</br>   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You</br>   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they</br>   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: -As a returning migrant, as someone who lived in the United States,</br>   have you faced discrimination here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure. You got to hide. Like, for example, I don't like to speak</br>   English because people treat you weird, you know? They, even my own family,</br>   say “you act funny. You was born here, you supposed to act like you been</br>   here.” You know? So, it's one kind of discrimination, but I just lift my</br>   chin up.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think it's for the same tribal reasons?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: No, it's more like a cultural thing. Because some people who's been</br>   there—you know how everyone talks about USA and say that the first country</br>   of the world? Many people do because envy, you know? And many people do it</br>   just because. You just different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we</br>   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, &quot;I'm an</br>   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.&quot; People</br>   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because</br>   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,</br>   you know? Or you have just different customs.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think the U.S. changed you then?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay</br>   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have</br>   money and they spend it all. I say, “Whoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.</br>   I split the bill.” Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you</br>   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,</br>   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody</br>   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Is how you feel different, or... You got to do your dishes, or…. For</br>   example, like here people is more independent into the U.S. You know?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Here, in the U.S. people are more independent or here?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the U.S. people are more independent than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What does that mean? How are they more independent?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: In the case like, I don't know the word in English but in Spanish</br>   they call [Spanish 00:26:19]. Which means the mom take too much care about</br>   their kids, and sometimes that don't let you grow up. You know what I'm</br>   saying? And that is very different between one and another culture.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And that's something you liked about the U.S.?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah. They independent, yeah. I lived on my own. If I am grumpy, it's</br>   okay to be grumpy. I mean, I want to be grumpy. Everybody gets grumpy. You</br>   know? I like that. Not that I need to please everyone, or I have to smile</br>   even though when I don't want to.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, I like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Or yeah, it's what I like. And more likely too much independence that</br>   becomes because the social opportunities you have. Meaning if you can pay</br>   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right</br>   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.</br>   In the U.S., I have the option to say, “I’m going to pay my rent. Even</br>   though this is my house, I just going to move.” Right here, I can’t do that</br>   because economics. I got another house—it belongs to me—but is in a</br>   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay</br>   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you</br>   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big</br>   deal.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?</br>   What's the story?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a</br>   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a</br>   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's</br>   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.</br>   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the</br>   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police</br>   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most—you go to the</br>   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have</br>   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to</br>   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it</br>   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. But, were you living in Maryland?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Georgia.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have a Maryland license?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yep. But, if you go to Georgia, they ask you for green card and</br>   social security which I don't have. So I was driving with my Maryland</br>   license.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Got it. So then, he turned you over to ICE?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I went to the judge, and the judge say, “Well, you don't supposed to</br>   be here because you have a valid driver's license. But, you do not belong</br>   to me. You belong to ICE court, or immigration court.” So they moved me</br>   over to immigration center.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What was that like?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It was like, the press... I never feel scared because I'm a big guy,</br>   I'm not afraid. But I mean, it was just luck. Just sitting there, doing</br>   nothing. Getting big. They feed you all the time. [Laughs]. You don't have</br>   nothing to do but eat and watch TV. And like right now, I go to swim. I jog</br>   a little bit. You know? That's what I do. I used to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I</br>   would… There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is</br>   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that</br>   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when</br>   I try—not try because I have the chances three times—I never feel like I</br>   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="18886636-4dcd-4f0e-8dd1-5690378bbfad" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Broken system, Time in the US, Mexico">Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.<br>
   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I<br>
   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump<br>
   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?<br>

Now, somehow, I do regret,</br>   like, “Man. I should do that.” But it was my decision. At the time I</br>   thought, “Well, I ain't going to be married if I don't love this person.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you have any hopes and dreams that sort of ended with your</br>   deportation?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Of what?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Of what you were going to do with yourself in the States with your</br>   life. How did you imagine your life?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: At that time?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Before you were deported.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Oh yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What were they?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, your hopes and dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: My hopes and dreams, it was like, well, I have good conduct. I don't</br>   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United</br>   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,</br>   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be</br>   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a—I don't</br>   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You</br>   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't</br>   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver’s license offense. It was</br>   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.</br>   So, my dreams, it was like, “Well, if you go to court, when you go to</br>   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...” [Laughs].</br>   I could even see, on the judge face, “I going to fuck you up, but I don’t</br>   have to.” I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.</br>   I’m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face. Like, “I going to</br>   deport you but.” He has a face like he is doing something wrong. [Laughs]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: He knew he was doing something wrong—</br> </br> </br>   Erik: He had that face, but—</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But he wanted to mess with you?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Yeah, probably. He has others.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So he felt bad, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I could see on his face he knew he was doing something wrong.</br>   [Chuckles]. I don't know what he think. I don't know if he is Republican,</br>   or Democrat. But, I can see on his face, Like, “Are you sure?” “Yes.”</br>   “Because if you married with your girlfriend and she has papers, maybe you</br>   can get a bond and stay.” “Yeah, but I don't want to stay here for a whole</br>   year like many people been locked down. I mean I'm a free person, I'm a</br>   working man. You lock me down for months. I hire a lawyer, it didn't work</br>   for me. So, what it makes sense? It makes no sense to be trying to give my</br>   money to the lawyer for him to do nothing. And at the end, I still on your</br>   hand. And you don't see him, or you don't look willing to help me. So let</br>   me go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, if you had a message, my last question, for Trump supporters,</br>   about the way in which they viewed immigrants, undocumented immigrants...</br>   If you had the opportunity to be in a room with them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I mean honestly.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What would you tell them?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Nothing because, honestly, I don't want to be like a crybaby person.</br>   I took my own decisions. I mentioned I had three chances to marry, I</br>   didn't. You know? I don't put blame on nobody. But I will tell the Trump</br>   supporter, I don't know. You ever read the—It was the French philosopher?</br>   He meant every country deserves their government. They deserve it.</br>   [Laughs]. It’s what they want. It's what they deserve. It's what I think.</br>   The same of Mexican people. We are corrupt, we have corrupt government.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But we're trying... Our project is to try to allow Americans to hear</br>   the voices of migrants.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, the Americans who’s going to hear that is the ones who want to</br>   hear. But I don't think Trump supporters will have that wish. [Laugh.]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: You know, more likely to be on a real scenario.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: But what I will tell them, like, “Wah, do not punish me.” No, I mean</br>   I don't cry. I pay my dues.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. And what would you tell the Mexican government, and Mexican</br>   society about the way they treat returning migrants, and what they should</br>   do?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The Mexican government, what I would tell them, not about the</br>   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the</br>   conquerors until today, they come to administrate the government and only</br>   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the</br>   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the</br>   immigrants, society. Mexico is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?</br>   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to the United</br>   States and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]</br> </br> </br>   Anita: trades?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: The trades from Bucareli. It's like a secret treatise where American</br>   government do not let the Mexican government to be self-sufficient over the</br>   country. So we can’t. I would say cancel those treatments because they</br>   belong to secrecy and develop the Mexican country. We don't have to be and</br>   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. But do you think, as someone who has lived in the United</br>   States, you bring something that could help Mexico? Just, your experience</br>   in the United States, has that changed you in a way that you can contribute</br>   positively to Mexico, and to the kind of changes you've outlined that</br>   Mexico needs? And people like you, who've had that experience in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I do not get your question.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: As somebody who has lived in the United States and has had these</br>   experiences that you've had in the United States, do you think that you</br>   have a contribution to make here in Mexico? What do you bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: What? What I do bring to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes. Special skills, or knowledge, or... How has that experience</br>   changed you in ways that would be good for Mexico to say, “Yes, migrants</br>   are a good resource?”</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: For Mexicans or for Americans?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: For Mexicans.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well I don't know. I just take care of myself. My contribution is</br>   what I would learn from United States, just take care of myself. Be</br>   responsible for myself. I mean, and it's how society change. And it's</br>   how—you ever read Melody Beattie?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: Well, I suggest if you found a book from Melody Beattie, he basically</br>   teach, write about a lot of co-dependency.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Uh-huh.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you</br>   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,</br>   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.</br> </br> </br>   Erik: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of</br>   myself. If I want to do a contribution to my city, I need to start for</br>   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do</br>   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.</br>   Besides contribute, do not be a load, or do not be a charge.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, from the US, you've brought self-sufficiency, you'd say?</br> </br> </br>   Erik: I would say, yes.</br> </div><\p>
