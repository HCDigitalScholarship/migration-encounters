 US and the circumstances surrounding it, how old you were, that sort of<br>
 thing.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Went over when I was really young, about a year or two years old, so<br>
 I didn't know much about it but what my parents told me once I got older<br>
 was where we lived, it was a small ranch type area, and there was a lot of<br>
 narc activity going there and it got to the point where one of my uncles<br>
 got injured in some type of crossfire, and so they wanted to avoid that for<br>
 us and they also wanted a better life for themselves and see for their<br>
 whole planning the family type part, so they decided they wanted to come to<br>
 the States. And they came, they crossed over when I was really young. My<br>
 mom told me that she carried me in her arms whenever she crossed me over,<br>
 and so it was... I don't have any idea about it, but that's what she told<br>
 me. I kind of have an imagination of what kind of went down.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Anne: And you said you had siblings, were they with you at the time?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No. When we went over there, I was the only child. Once I got over</br> there, then my mom and my dad got divorced when I was around four. My mom</br> already had my stepdad kind of on the side and my dad knew my stepdad,</br> actually. They actually used to be coworkers together, so even to this day,</br> they still talk to each other and they get along whenever it comes down to</br> family situations, they get along. They can sit in front of each other and</br> talk and stuff. But once they separated, that's when my mom had my</br> stepsister, my stepbrother and my other stepsister. As in my dad and my</br> mom, I was the only child.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I never really had my own... All my brothers and sisters, it was</br> once I was already older, about... My sister's 17 now, so I was about seven</br> or eight.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Nice. What was the city that you moved to when you first moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first moved over there, we were in Texas, and then mom was</br> always big about moving around. She always wanted to... It was always her</br> idea of looking for a better life, the American dream, whatever you say. So</br> she was always trying to upgrade to a new house and better location for</br> schools, better location for a family, stuff like that. So we went all over</br> Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Moving a lot and at that point, it kind of was something that I</br> didn't enjoy really, because I wanted a stable home, something where I</br> could build some friendships and know that I was going to have those</br> friendships there for the long run. And I'd just be like, &quot;Oh yeah, we'll</br> probably be here for a year and then my mom's going to want to move again</br> and I'm going to have to start a whole new life all over.&quot; That's at the</br> point I decided I wanted to go live with my dad. My dad had been living in</br> the same area for about 10 years, so I was like, that is not going to be an</br> issue at all, for him to move. He hasn't moved in 10 years, he's not going</br> to move at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And once I moved over there, he did move a block or two down, just so</br> we can go ahead and get a bigger apartment than where he was, because he</br> was just living in a single bedroom apartment for himself because he never</br> remarried after my mom. Once I moved with him, he moved about two blocks</br> down just to another apartment where it was bigger space, where I could</br> stay with him and from there, we never moved again. That's when I started</br> doing from like seventh grade, all the way up till I finished my last six</br> years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Half of it, mom was everywhere and then the other half, I was in a</br> stable location where I actually met the friends that I have now that still</br> talk to me now that I'm here and that still help me whenever they can. I</br> don't even have to ask them, they'll just tell me, &quot;Hey, right now I'm</br> going to send you some money or I'm going to do this, I'm going to give</br> your kids something, where can I meet them? Blah, blah, blah.&quot; I know that</br> they're going to help me, but I don't like to ask them because it's not</br> something that I don't really like to ask them for, for stuff because I</br> know it's not their fault that I got deported or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Same with my family, because my mom always told me, she's like,</br> &quot;Trust me, you don't want to go to Mexico.&quot; She's like, &quot;Life over there is</br> not as you picture it. It's like your cousins and everything, they say</br> they're having fun over there, but they've been over there they're whole</br> life.&quot; He's like, &quot;You? You're going to have difficulties.&quot; One, is the</br> tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for</br> y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family</br> over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her</br> a couple times and tell her that they have me and, &quot;We have your son and</br> you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But she always have someone with her like my sister or my stepdad or</br> something, and while she's on the phone with them, then my stepdad, my</br> sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can</br> just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that</br> has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They</br> worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of</br> myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle</br> myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because</br> they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just</br> everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in</br> transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff</br> because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next</br> thing you know, you're just like, &quot;Oh, my wallet, my phone's gone.&quot; I don't</br> even know where it happened, nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And authorities don't really do much to help. They almost kind of get</br> mad at you for getting robbed. They're like, &quot;We told you not to have your</br> things out in the open, we told you to check your pockets and make sure you</br> have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can</br> feel that you're getting to get them swiped out.&quot; It's not really a big</br> help. Then it comes down to that part, they're like, &quot;Well, it's gone now.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;Whoever it was, wherever they are now, it's gone.&quot; And it's</br> like, man, it's his...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And there's videos that I've seen about that stuff and it's just</br> like, it's not even just one person. It's a group of people that huddle on</br> you and it's just regular people, it's older people, it's not just young</br> people like kids and people my age, adults and people. It's also older</br> people like grandparents or just old little ladies. Couple ladies, they</br> come in and they'd be in a little group, they try asking you for</br> directions, one of them is distracting you, the other one is taking stuff</br> out of your pocket. Then she hands it off to someone else that's behind</br> them, that person walks away. Someone else comes in like a distraction</br> like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in it together and at the end, some people start to act</br> like they're actually caring about what's going on. In the end, they're all</br> in cahoots with it. You can't trust anybody. In the States, at least you</br> knew you could help somebody and it's probably legit. Over here, you can't</br> really trust that thing where somebody comes up to you and they're like,</br> &quot;Hey, I need some help, something's going on right here around the corner.</br> Somebody's trying to hurt my mom or somebody's trying to hurt my sister.&quot;</br> You can't even trust that because you might go around the corner and</br> they're just going to jump you and rob you. It's all just in cahoots to get</br> something out of you.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: More over here where we live, or where we work, it used to be a lot</br> calmer, but now it got to the point where they've considered it a red spot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, because they say there's too much going around the area, as far</br> as with drugs, with the robbings. People know that obviously we get some</br> decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.</br> The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we</br> get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking</br> and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.</br> It's probable cause, supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And if they catch you with something, they won't take you to jail.</br> They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from</br> you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't</br> offer them the money or say, &quot;I'm not going to give you any money,&quot; they'll</br> scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give</br> you a last chance. They're like, &quot;Okay, last chance before we get there,</br> it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or</br> you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want</br> is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.</br> It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me</br> and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the</br> fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we</br> get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our</br> attitude that we take against them.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Then it's like, all right, I had a cop one time, I didn't have</br> anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,</br> everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just</br> bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give</br> away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They</br> caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, &quot;Why do</br> you have two phones?&quot; Like thought I stole one. I'm like, &quot;No, I didn't.</br> All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The guy didn't like my whole attitude that I had with them, so he</br> decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I</br> think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a</br> big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, &quot;Look, I've</br> got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of</br> your phones,&quot; He's like, &quot;And actually, the one I want is that one.&quot; He</br> wanted the brand new one. &quot;And actually, I want this one. So look, this is</br> the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,</br> or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that</br> anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go</br> with me.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go</br> ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got</br> with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Obviously, I'm not going to risk it. I didn't believe him at the same</br> time, but since they do always take money and any other types of bribes, so</br> I'm like, I'm not going to risk it, try to play the brave guy and be like,</br> &quot;All right, go ahead and take me,&quot; and stuff, and then they do it, and then</br> I'm going to be like, &quot;Oh no, never mind.&quot; They might even end up taking</br> both of my phones or anything like that. I have friends that because they</br> said no and they refused to give the phone, they put it inside their pants</br> so the cops couldn't get it, they ended up beating them up. They would just</br> grab them and beat them and, &quot;All right, there you go. You can go on about</br> your merry way. We didn't get nothing from you, but we at least gave you a</br> beating. Maybe you'll learn.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This area right here is not really good for us, especially at</br> nighttime. And any cops that see us, any cops or anything like that,</br> they're going to try to pull us over and find something. If they don't find</br> something or if they already know you and they don't like you, because they</br> recognize. Me, they come up to me and they almost know my name already.</br> They're like, &quot;Hey, so what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you clean today</br> too?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, like every other time. Yeah.&quot; It's like, I work</br> here. You do this every day, every day you don't get anything from me. What</br> makes you think that today's going to be different? Obviously, I know that</br> I'm not going to... That this area is not the area to be doing anything. If</br> I want to do anything at all, I'm not going to do it here at work or</br> outside of work.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's annoying sometimes, because sometimes even because of that,</br> within the two blocks, they could search you about two, maybe three times.</br> Because one guy will search you on the bikes, the guys on the bikes, then</br> you're okay, they'll search you, they'll let you go. About another block</br> later, you'll bump into guys that are just walking around and they'll</br> search you too. Another block later, the guys in the cars, the trucks are</br> going by, they'll stop in front. &quot;Hey, let me do a quick search, just</br> random.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Random.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Random?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You can be late to work just because of that. You could be 10 minutes</br> early or two minutes early, but if you get stopped twice right here at</br> least, you lost all your time right there. You're running late already to</br> work. That's either before work, during lunch, on a break, after work when</br> you're going home. It's just anytime. It got to the point where work, it's</br> a mission just to go from your work to where your transport is. Either the</br> train line, the substation or the buses. They're only about three...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The train stations are three blocks away, the bus is maybe two blocks</br> away, and within that little range, it's probably the biggest mission ever.</br> People talk about the areas where they have all the drugs, they beat them</br> or places like that where it's supposedly heavy, and really, I've gone to</br> those areas because I have friends and people that live in those areas and</br> I've gone to visit them, and the cops are there in that area, they're right</br> outside of the locations where they're selling stuff. They can smell the</br> stuff, they can see people going in and out of the place, but they don't go</br> in the place. They do checks on everybody that comes out of there, to try</br> to see if maybe they can catch them slipping up and get some money off of</br> them, a phone, whatever they can, but they will never go inside of the</br> location where they see everybody going in and out of.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's either because they're already being paid by them or it's</br> because they know that if they go in there, it's going to be some big drama</br> with the guys in there, or it's just that they don't really care anybody</br> that. They just want to make something for their day. Here, it's almost</br> just like that. There's cops everywhere, they stop you for anything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. Wow. So let's go back to the US. You're with your mom, and is</br> she working? Did she start working when you guys moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. When we first moved, yeah. She was working in a restaurant, in</br> a mall, actually. She was working inside a restaurant in the mall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And my dad was doing maintenance work at the apartments where we</br> lived.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, nice.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: We were getting, the apartment where we lived, we were getting a good</br> discount and then my mom was working a night shift or... no, wait. She was</br> doing morning shift in the mall. My dad and my mom would get off around the</br> same time. That was never really an issue with them. But once she got</br> divorced and she got with my stepdad, she stopped working. She just focused</br> more on with me, she got pregnant and started having my sister, and after</br> that, she just focused more on being a housewife. Being a housewife, being</br> a house mom.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She did great. She kept herself real busy and she always worried a</br> lot about us, tried to give us everything we needed for school, for food,</br> dress wise. Anything we needed. She did what she could with what my stepdad</br> would provide her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he also from Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. He was from Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he a citizen or was he undocumented?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No, he was also undocumented. He's still undocumented to the point.</br> He was working with my dad. They were coworkers.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, that's what you were saying. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then I don't know the whole story of how my mom and my stepdad</br> started talking, but I know they were coworkers because they've told me</br> that part before, and my dad's also told me. He's like, &quot;Yeah, I know him.</br> We used to work together, he was just my partner, in a way.&quot; I mean, my dad</br> doesn't seem like he has any hard feelings about it, but he never remarried</br> again, so I don't know what happened there. But my mom got remarried and</br> now it's been like, I don't know, I suppose right now it's been about</br> almost 20 years? And he's never remarried, he's never really bothered, I’ve</br> never met him to have a girlfriend, no other kids, nothing. After the first</br> one, he just gave up and just enjoys his house alone with the dogs and</br> stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How was school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: School? Actually, school really wasn't that bad. At first, it was a</br> little bit different, due to the language barrier, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you hadn't learned English until then. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into</br> kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and</br> me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my</br> home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.</br> So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my</br> first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and</br> it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff</br> a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more</br> understanding and I was getting it really quick.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's like they do say, once you learn it at a early age, it's kind of</br> easier than learning at a older age, once you've already got this whole</br> other concept of what you're doing. But I mean, yeah. After that, after my</br> second year of school, it was actually pretty good breeze. Breeze through.</br> Nothing like bullying, was never really an issue, anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You had lots of friends?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because of the same reasons, like I said, my mom</br> liked to move a lot, I had friends everywhere and I had certain people that</br> obviously do make some type of connection with, and you maybe stay in</br> contact with those more than anybody else or you stay in contact with that</br> person and nobody else out of the whole school or whatever. So I had</br> friends everywhere in different areas and later on, when I moved with my</br> dad, I actually bumped into one of my older friends from fourth, fifth</br> grade. I bumped into him in eighth grade and I didn't recognize him, he</br> recognized me and he was like, &quot;Yeah, I remember you. We were in this class</br> together.&quot; And he started telling me, &quot;Oh my god, I remember.&quot; And I was</br> like, what a coincidence. I was two cities away, an hour away, and now</br> you're here. We're back in the same school together.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: He started presenting me to some other friends, and obviously, there</br> was always Hispanics and there was always what they call the Chicanos, the</br> ones that were born over there but have their parents move here. That's</br> what my sisters and my brothers are considered, and they're always real</br> friendly. The racism and stuff, in areas where I lived, it never really was</br> an issue. I know I order heard about some areas where I have family members</br> that live in maybe Louisiana and Wisconsin and stuff like that, yeah, no,</br> they see a little bit more but it was never that issue where I was at.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was more, I lived in a kind of rough area, but I went to school in</br> the nice, high class schools and stuff, with people from rich neighborhoods</br> and people got to the point where they thought that my family was living</br> all right, because they had two vehicles. But it wasn't really anything</br> like that, it was just that my dad had his work truck that he used for all</br> his equipment and everything that he needed, and then he had his car that</br> was just for whenever he went somewhere to just store or just to have some</br> fun, it's not as much gas. Since he was still working with the same</br> apartment company that he's been working with, the apartment that he was</br> getting, he was now getting it for free. He didn't have to pay any rent or</br> water, nothing like that, everything was free.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So that helped a lot. It made it look like we were having a lot more</br> money than what we actually had, just because we were avoiding the rent.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. And everybody thought that but I was like, &quot;No, not really.&quot;</br> I've never been really the flashy type stuff. Everybody wanted the</br> Jordan's, all this stuff, nice. No, not me. I just wanted something... As</br> long as it looked nice and I liked the way it looked, I would buy it,</br> whether it was at a market for garage sale or was it Ross or Walmart. I</br> really didn't care much about the brands, as long as I liked it and I liked</br> the way it looks on me.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But I always found that funny that people thought that my parents had</br> more than what they actually had. I'm like, no, it's not bad, it's just</br> that my mom knows how to manage the money that my stepdad gives her and my</br> dad, he doesn't have anybody else but himself and he doesn't pay any rent</br> or anything like that. He's not wasting his money on stupid stuff either.</br> He likes to go out a lot so he goes on vacations a lot. Since he's been</br> with the company, they give a lot of vacations. He goes out, goes out of</br> the state, visits a lot of places and stuff like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was just really fun. That was the only thing that I wouldn't</br> consider bullying, my friends were just more like a teasing type thing.</br> Saying about the money. He's like, &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; I don't know why, he's like,</br> &quot;Why don't you take us out to eat?&quot; He's like, &quot;You're the one with money.&quot;</br> It was just funny to me. Then later on, they would have some racist jokes</br> in a way, but I knew that they were friends. I knew that it was just</br> teasing, messing around. It was never really serious.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, right.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Sometimes it would be like, &quot;Wow, your people don't have a lot of</br> money, blah, blah, blah.&quot; And then sometimes it was like, &quot;No, you don't</br> count. You're not even from here.&quot; It was always funny. It was never really</br> a serious... I never had really serious issues with school and bullying,</br> nothing like that. It was always pretty fun.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: <span id="0774c8e9-664c-46af-8cdc-694b5fbd95ee" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, The United States, Jobs, Opportunity, Language, Learning English">And over here, when I started school, it was a little bit different.<br>
 People do look at you different, everybody wants to ask you questions about<br>
 over there, ask you how to say stuff. I'm not bothered by it, but it does<br>
 get kind of annoying at some point. Everybody at all times, for every<br>
 single thing. It's just like, everybody, at all times, for every single<br>
 thing, and like people here go to school and they have English homework, I<br>
 don't mind doing that, but then when we go somewhere and they're hanging<br>
 out and every other thing, they're like, &quot;Hey, what is that? Or how you say<br>
 this or how do you do that or how do you say that or what does that mean or<br>
 what does this...&quot; It's like all right, I can't really do what I want to do<br>
 because I got to go over here and translate everything else or tell you how<br>
 to say all this other stuff just because. I don't mind, but it's like to a<br>
 certain extent, at some point, I do want to think about doing my career for<br>
 English. Pretty much being a teacher.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Anne: Be an English teacher?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I have the language and I just need to take the classes for</br> them to show me how to show somebody else.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But at the same time, I don't know, man. I don't want to have to</br> explain to people stuff about how to say stuff. It's kind of hard for me to</br> explain it, because it was just something that I was taught. I learned just</br> like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you were a kid.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. For me, I consider English my first language. It's really my</br> strong point. My Spanish is... Even though I spoke it at home, once I got</br> older, obviously I was always with my friends out playing video games,</br> going to basketball games, football, just doing activities, so I was never</br> home then. So my Spanish started going from pretty good to just like I can</br> get by. And now, it's getting better now, but there's certain things that I</br> still don't understand. That's why I found it a little bit harder when I</br> started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their</br> language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some</br> bigger words that I don't understand.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I</br> also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling</br> like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But</br> it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words</br> that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there</br> in class like, &quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So now he has to explain all the thing over again in simple words or</br> baby terms for me so I can understand it. It's just like... Besides that, I</br> found that kind of hard but I would never leave school because of that. I</br> was willing to struggle with it but like I said, once I had my baby and</br> everything here, then everything just... I had to put all that aside so I</br> could focus on the money because the job that I had at that point wasn't</br> all that much, and obviously, a baby is a big...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Expense, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it's a big expense and the girl I got with, my ex-wife, she</br> already had a baby. I had a stepson and then I was going to have my son,</br> and also to buy stuff here and send it over there for my daughter. I don't</br> send them money because I know the money that I could send a whole paycheck</br> from that I get right now, and it would be like maybe $100 or $150 for</br> them, almost nothing. So I know that instead of doing that, I know I could</br> buy some stuff here. Toys, shoes, clothes and I could send to them, my</br> parents will cover the fee of paying the shipping and I know it will help</br> them a lot more than me sending them $100 or something like that, and it</br> would affect me a lot more here.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: A lot more, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And it wouldn't affect them at all over there. I got that boundary</br> right there. It's different. It's a lot different. It took me almost the</br> whole year and a half or two to get used it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Get used to it, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But no, still, there's still some things that I have to learn</br> or that somebody shows me and I'm just like, &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; I've met some</br> people that are actually from here and they've learned English here, in the</br> school, and they're actually pretty good at it and they told me about their</br> life here and they're the ones that show me around or explain to me some</br> type of legal stuff or not legal stuff or maybe how stuff works around</br> here. I still learn a lot of stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This city, I know the area where I live, I know my area around here</br> where I work, and I know maybe one or two areas where some friends live, my</br> main friends, and that's it. I cannot get around. I know how to use the</br> stations for the trains, but don't tell me, &quot;Hey, come meet me over here in</br> so-and-so place or in this city or in this community.&quot; Because I'm not</br> going to. I'm not going to know. Tell me a station, I'll probably go to the</br> station and then from there, just meet me there because I'm not going to</br> get lost and I don't really trust the areas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You could tell me it's all calm, but everybody says my area is a</br> little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type</br> of situations over there. No assaults. How do they call it? People that get</br> on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,</br> hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and</br> everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But</br> at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live</br> and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.</br> They're like, &quot;Oh yeah, that's the guy, he lives over there somewhere. I</br> see him every day or I see him every two days, but I seen him a couple</br> times.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But when you go to the new area, it's like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Then you're a target.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Everybody looks at you, everybody wants to know who you are.</br> Are you some type of police officer trying to do an undercover operation or</br> something? They either come at you because they think you look suspicious</br> or they come at you because you look like a easy target and you're easy to</br> pick for, phone or something. Either way, it's just bad all around.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Or even the cops, they look at you and they see you looking around</br> too much like you don't know what you're doing, they come at you like,</br> &quot;Hey, what are you doing here? Who are you looking for? Are you trying to</br> connect stuff, are you trying to find somebody with some type of substance</br> or something?&quot; Like no, I'm just trying to find the street here. I don't</br> know where I'm at. Most of these streets don't even have names. They're</br> covered or they're blocked by little taco stands. That's not bad.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Something I like here is that there's food everywhere. There's stands</br> everywhere for everything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How does it compare--the food here to US?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I stopped eating all that fast food. In the US, it was nothing but</br> Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell. Just nothing but fast food. I think the</br> only healthy... If you consider it healthy food that I would eat over there</br> would be Chinese food, Chinese restaurants. Over here, it's all mainly, not</br> homemade, but it's handmade. Our restaurants too, fast foods, they have</br> their little machines and everything but over here it's like, you go and</br> you buy some tacos, they're cooking it right there in front of you. They</br> cut it open and cook it in front of you, they do everything right there in</br> front of you. And in the States, you go to fast food, it's like, &quot;Okay,</br> I'll order this.&quot; &quot;Okay, don't worry, we'll call you in a minute and you'll</br> have your order ready.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And the burgers, the patties are like they heat them up, they do all</br> this to them. I've heard stories I don't like to hear about them because I</br> like the food and I don't want it to be ruined for me, but over here,</br> that's the only difference. I've stories about supposedly, if you don't get</br> along with certain people, you got to watch out what you say to certain</br> people because then they'll put stuff in your food and you end up...</br> They'll drug you or something or they'll do something just because somebody</br> else paid them to do it or stuff like that, that's why you got to be</br> careful who you mess with around areas, because it's so hard to...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Over here, everybody looks the same, really. You can't really tell</br> who's into the narcs, who's into some heavy drugs, who's into just being</br> calm, who's maybe undercover police, something like that. Over here, it's</br> like you can't really get mad at anybody on the streets, can't go off on</br> them, can't really argue with them because that person could just be</br> involved with somebody higher up or could be involved with the narcs, the</br> little gangs that there is around the areas and all right, so now you mess</br> with that person, so they already know where you work, they know you're</br> around this area all the time. They'll come and get you the next day or</br> they'll go away, come back with some friends and they'll mess with you, or</br> like they said about the food stuff or they'll come and pick you up in a</br> truck, they'll kidnap you for a while, torture you and just go and kidnap</br> you just for fun. Just to leave you in the room and not eat for a couple</br> days.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's never happened to me, but it's happened to my coworkers and</br> stuff and they've missed work one or two days and they're about to get</br> fired and they come back, and then they're like, &quot;Man, I was kidnapped. I</br> didn't have no form of communication or anything, I was kidnapped for the</br> past two days.&quot; All they ask for at work, because they know that it happens</br> and there is no way for them to prove it, really, there's no way for you to</br> prove it either so all they ask for you to do is at least go make the</br> report with the police. That way, there is at least some type of...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Record, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. That kind of follows up with your story. Like okay, at least he</br> made the report so it must be something that really happened. Well, police,</br> they won't do anything. I found that out almost a week or two after I got</br> to Mexico. A lady got robbed for her purse. There's this area that</br> everybody knows and they're like, &quot;You don't want to go in that area.&quot;</br> Because it looks beautiful and everything because the houses are all</br> different colors, they're painted all nicely and they look real nice, but</br> everybody's like, &quot;You do not want to go down there.&quot; It was like, if you</br> go in there, you're probably not going to come out or you're probably going</br> to come out, but you're going to come out without your phone, your wallet,</br> sometimes even throw you out just all naked, just for the hell of it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: That day, I saw the lady get robbed for her wallet and her purse, and</br> the guys ran into those areas. The police officers were around the corner,</br> the lady ran to them, she told them, the police came. They're like, &quot;Who is</br> it?&quot; They were looking at me. I was like, &quot;No, no. It wasn't me.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;It wasn't me, definitely not, but I saw it happen.&quot; I was like,</br> &quot;Yeah, they ran up that way. Yeah, like she said, it was two guys, blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Gave them all the information, they're like, &quot;Okay. Well, man, what</br> we're going to suggest you do is go down to the court office, or the place</br> where you make charges, and lift the charge pretty much about what</br> happened.&quot; He's like, &quot;Because right now, if we go up there into that area,</br> there could be more of them and they could also take our stuff, rob us or</br> maybe even jump us or we could go up there right now and they're probably</br> already gone inside a safe house or some friend's house. The chances of us</br> getting your stuff back right now are literally zero to none. It's not</br> worth the risk for us to go up there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, huh. I was like, you're the police, you've got guns. What's</br> the point of you getting guns and you being trained and everything if</br> you're not going to go into the areas where the people are that are doing</br> the bad stuff?</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I learned that at a young age. Well, not a young age but early point</br> in time when I got to Mexico. I quickly learned that. I saw that firsthand</br> and I was like, all right, so they're not going to help. They're not going</br> to help at all unless you physically caught the person or you know exactly</br> where that person is at, then they'll go and help you get them, if it's not</br> a area where it's known for heavy trafficking and stuff. They won't go in</br> there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Could we talk about what happened to you in the United States to make</br> you end up here?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a</br> younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had</br> anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you</br> know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for</br> some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising</br> my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my</br> family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad</br> was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the</br> moment.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was</br> always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. &quot;Look, the day that</br> I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise</br> my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues</br> going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm</br> paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still</br> AB type student.&quot; But I don't know.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,</br> that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger</br> just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was</br> a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me</br> probation for two years. When I was 12, I was supposed to be off but at a</br> year and a half, a year and eight months, they told me they were going to</br> give me a lie detector test, the polygraph test, which I was not aware of.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: About what?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going</br> to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to</br> meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a</br> year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,</br> &quot;Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just</br> going to do a polygraph test.&quot; I heard about them and I heard that some</br> people were like, &quot;Yeah, they don't really work.&quot; But I had my doubts about</br> that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.</br> If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know</br> that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an</br> advantage of people.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There</br> were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't</br> supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since</br> I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an</br> assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people</br> younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to</br> all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my</br> school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also</br> hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at</br> because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.</br> If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You were like 12?</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="537f8ff6-2e1c-4ed1-b1b1-f94728f116ed" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US">Axel: Yeah. I mean, I was there since we never had any official document,<br>
 the way that we worked over there would be getting a fake ID with a fake<br>
 name and everything. Fake ID, fake name, fake social security to work.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Anne: And to get a license?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Well, the license is a lot harder now, but I never got that at all.</br> The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the</br> car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,</br> everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I</br> at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never</br> tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's</br> something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they</br> don't have one, and they're like, &quot;You'll never want to say that you don't</br> have it. You just want to say you forgot it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, &quot;Okay, next time, make sure you</br> have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with</br> you.&quot; Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take</br> your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be</br> driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you</br> can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that</br> fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You</br> couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for</br> legal...They actually ran the social security check.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that will, obviously, since it was a fake one, it didn't pass.</br> They gave me just a number that looked legit, but it wasn't. If they ran it</br> through, it'd be like, &quot;Oh, it fell, didn't go through. Maybe the number's</br> wrong, can you double check it?&quot; And you're like, &quot;Okay, yeah, let me go</br> ahead and double check it.&quot; And you just never go to that place again</br> because you know they're going to check it, so you're just like, &quot;No, never</br> mind. Let's try another place.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie</br> detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to</br> get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, &quot;Hey, well, you</br> failed your lie detector test.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, look,</br> out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.</br> You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't</br> supposed to be doing it.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you're going to have to go before</br> the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going</br> to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and</br> then...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering</br> me five years, and I was like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It's sort of in jail.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards</br> are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Only with juveniles?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But as far as the environment goes, it's still the same. Yeah,</br> they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My</br> parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and</br> fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of</br> that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody</br> because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or</br> leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they threw me in county and I was fighting my case while I was in</br> county for about...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You're 12 or 13?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting</br> it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were</br> trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,</br> something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea</br> of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time</br> or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting</br> immigration.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: In the end, I've got a deal with the judge. They were going to extend</br> my probation for another year. We got that deal on a Friday. By the time</br> that the judge closed the deal and everything on my lawyer, it was already</br> 4:30 in the afternoon. The probation office is closed at five. They were</br> like, &quot;Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you</br> have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so</br> that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up</br> here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation</br> office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone</br> number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already</br> get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take</br> your probation and you're already registered into it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.&quot; I'm already signing the</br> paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just</br> got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend</br> I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I</br> know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it</br> seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular</br> clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.</br> Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except</br> me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm</br> like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and</br> everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like</br> immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.</br> So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way</br> you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you</br> don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, I’m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the</br> people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really</br> disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called</br> my parents and my friends were like, &quot;Hey, are you out already? Where are</br> you so we can go pick you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm inside my cell.&quot; And they're</br> like, &quot;What, why?&quot; I was like, &quot;Apparently, immigration put a hold on me</br> this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,</br> they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then</br> once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why</br> are you here still?&quot; And they were like, &quot;Oh well, it's because you have an</br> immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back</br> in.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,</br> three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were</br> trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,</br> when my judge got the deal where they were like, &quot;Okay, this is what we're</br> going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and</br> you're only going to do two years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: But you didn't do anything. You've been in jail all this time.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're like, &quot;We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of</br> a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed</br> your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your</br> probation.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile</br> for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you</br> therapy sessions for anger management.&quot; He's like, &quot;They also talk about</br> drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,</br> so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your</br> personal sessions also to help you with your issues.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And I was like, &quot;Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least</br> you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,</br> anything like that.&quot; &quot;No, no. Those options aren't available for you.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your</br> court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.&quot; Even my lawyer told</br> me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in</br> juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new</br> again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,</br> new everything was a little bit different in two years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did you go back to school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I</br> used to go. Everybody was like, &quot;Where were you last two years?&quot; Somebody</br> started a rumor I was in Canada. Some people knew where I were, because I</br> kept in contact with a couple people and they knew exactly where I were.</br> Everything went back to normal once I got back to school. Once I got off,</br> they did give me six months of probation and I didn't do anything. I was</br> doing exactly what they wanted me. From work, from house to school, from</br> school to the house. No time in between at all, no walks with anybody,</br> nothing. It was like all right, going to school, cool. Got to school,</br> school's out, okay, I'm going home. &quot;Hey, come stay, come go for an ice</br> cream.&quot; Nope. I got to go home.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just six months after that, I would probably go out with them for a</br> drink, I would go out with them for a game of basketball, football,</br> swimming, anything but just not right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: About six months past, they gave me the same probation officer as</br> before and he actually congratulated me. He's like, &quot;Hey man, you did it.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;You passed the lie detector test again.&quot; Because they gave me</br> another one before the end. &quot;You passed it, everything's good.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;I'm here to give you your paperwork that you're off.&quot; He's like, &quot;I know</br> it's three days till you're off, but we're just going to go ahead and</br> sign.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, so that way, you sign right now, you know that on</br> the eighth, you are a free man.&quot; He's like, &quot;You're good to go.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, signed my papers, everything was good and I stayed out of</br> trouble from 14 all the way till I was 19, which is when the recent charges</br> and everything came, the evading arrest and I got my shit. I didn't have no</br> reason to evade arrest, I didn't have anything on me or anything. I had had</br> one or two beers. I wasn't drunk or anything, but I did know I had kind of</br> smell, and I knew that they were going to play that on me, and I was still</br> at...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they pull you over? Were you speeding or something?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No. I wasn't speeding. They just said that it was random checks. But</br> really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a</br> couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check</br> again. I was like, &quot;Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're</br> going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have</br> my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed</br> to have alcohol at all.&quot; I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for</br> me, so I panicked, I stepped on the gas and I left.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I left and like I said, I got away because it was nighttime. I went</br> into some streets, the streets that I knew. I turned some turns and turns</br> and I lost them somewhere between. I ended up in Oklahoma, stayed over</br> there for four days at a friend’s house to try to avoid being found or</br> being captured and stuff. After four days, I was like, &quot;Okay, should be</br> calm or they should already...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I watch TV. It's like some of the TV shows, the first 48 hours, if</br> they don't find you after that, it's like they're... Yeah. But no, that's</br> definitely not that at all. I went back to my house and as soon as I got to</br> my house, I went in, I got some clothes so I can take a shower, I turned on</br> the water and as soon as I turned on the water, I started hearing knocks on</br> the door. They were like, &quot;Hey, police. We have your warrant for your</br> arrest. Either you come out or we're going to knock the door down. Blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot; So-and-so.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The house where I was living, the apartment I was living at, at that</br> point, my dad had got a house thanks to his job. So he got a nice little</br> house and he had already paid it off so it was his. He was like, &quot;Hey, I</br> can get you the apartment at a discount. It's going to be under my name, so</br> you have to take care of it.&quot; When they said all that, honestly, I thought</br> about. I was like, &quot;I could run out the back door, I could run out the</br> window and maybe escape again for a couple more days. This time I'll go for</br> a month or so.&quot; But then I was like, if they knock the door down, it's</br> going to go all back on my dad. He's been having this job for the longest</br> time. I was like, I don't want him to lose his job because of me after so</br> many years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I turned myself in. They took me back to the station, they showed</br> me the video footage of the day that they were chasing me. The dash cams</br> and everything. And they did catch a glimpse of my face when I did one</br> turn. They paused it perfectly and framed it everything, and they saw the</br> side of my face and it was perfect match and everything. I tried fighting</br> my case. I was late to court. Same late to court one time. Flight risk.</br> Even though my probation officer was there and my probation officer told</br> the judge that I was running late due to traffic. The judge was like, &quot;No,</br> he should have left the house a lot earlier. He should have left on time</br> with extra time. So we're going to put him in jail, in county.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was in county. Like I said, they took me out of my clothes and</br> everything, probation. Then they were like, &quot;No, immigration's got a hold</br> on you, so you got to go back to your cell.&quot; Went back to my cell, then</br> they transferred because they were like, &quot;Well, you're now a long-term, so</br> we're going to transfer you to this other unit that we have over here for</br> long-term people that are fighting their cases.&quot; Which was a lot worse than</br> the actual county itself.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it was a lot worse. They were like bird cages. It wasn't even</br> dorms anymore. It was just bird cages with six beds in there and it was six</br> people in there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then county was like, it's a dorm with two beds, you have your</br> toilet, you have your sink, all cool. And over here, it's a bird cage.</br> There's about six or 10 of you guys. There's about two toilets and one</br> shower, and you got to take turns and all this and that, and the sinks and</br> people get messy. Arguments with a lot of people. It was just a lot worse.</br> I was fighting my case, trying to get out on bond or get out on ankle</br> monitor or something, for about four or five months.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Finally, I gave up on that. I was like, I'll just take whatever plea</br> they gave me. They gave me the two year plea. So I took it. I was like,</br> okay. Two years again. I was like all right, here we go. But this time,</br> it's actually jail. It's not county, it's not juvenile or anything like</br> that. I thought it was going to be a lot worse than what it was, but like I</br> said, it was the same. The only people that were different were really...</br> The guys were bigger, but there was always mean guys in juvies too. The</br> only difference that I really noticed were the guards. Since you were now</br> older guys, you're adults, the guards were rough, they were mean, they were</br> just abusive.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Not abusive, really, because they never really hit you, because over</br> there, they're more strict than here with that type of stuff, but they</br> would talk really... They would talk down to you a lot and stuff like that.</br> When I did my two years there, it was depressing for me. Every time, those</br> two times that I did my time, I wasn't really depressed about me getting</br> caught up, I wasn't depressed about my situation, I was more depressed</br> about not being able to be with my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you had a daughter?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I had two daughters.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Two daughters?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first got locked up, I didn't have my daughters yet. I had my</br> first daughter when I was 15, 16. Almost right after I got out of jail, the</br> first time after my probation and everything. That's when I had my first</br> daughter. And my second daughter, I had her when I was 17. I knew her for</br> about a year, and then the year she was born, I got locked up a couple</br> months later, so I only saw her a couple times and then the rest of the</br> time I saw her through a glass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they come to see you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. My mom, she did. My daughter's mom wouldn't go, because they</br> wouldn't let her in because she wasn't immediate family. So my mom would go</br> in or my dad, and they would take my daughters in and I would talk to them.</br> Talk to them or just joke around with them, play with them there from</br> across the glass. That was my whole relationship with my second daughter.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My first daughter, I did have some encounters with her. I did have</br> some years with her there. But the important years, when she was actually</br> talking and already doing stuff, I was never there. My second daughter</br> neither. I did talk to them on the phone still, I did FaceTime to them, and</br> my daughter just cried. She wants to know when I'm going to go visit, and I</br> don't even know how to explain to her the whole situation. I just keep</br> telling them, &quot;One day, just wait. One of these days, we're going to see</br> each other. Either your mom comes over here or I go over there, but we'll</br> see each other.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you're still friendly with the mom?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. With both of them. And my family too. My family know that</br> they're my babies, that they're my blood babies and my mom, &quot;It's not their</br> fault for whatever mistakes you made. It's not their fault for whatever</br> they're going through. That's your blood, that means that's my blood,</br> they're my grandkids so I don't want to see them struggling, I don't want</br> to see them doing bad.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's always helped them out, my mom's always been there for them.</br> She's tried to help me out, I'm like, &quot;No, I'm alright right now. The day I</br> need help, don't worry, I will ask you. Don't worry, you're the only person</br> I can count on. So I know that whenever I need some help, I either got to</br> call you or my dad.&quot; I was like, &quot;But right now, just help my daughters</br> out. Since you're over there, just help them out. Either they need milk,</br> diapers, whatever it is they need, just help them out.&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm</br> doing my own thing over here, I'm helping my baby that I have over here and</br> my stepson and I'm buying clothes to send over there, and plus I'm trying</br> to make a life over here for myself also, but I also want to know that</br> they're okay over there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I left the States, when I got deported, I had my car, I had a</br> lot of furnitures, TV, everything. All of that, I gave it all to my baby's</br> mom. The newer baby. And she kept me everything. I had a nice car, had a</br> nice TV, everything, I had nice furniture. Not going to say she was the</br> best of moms at that time, but now she is. Now she's doing a lot better,</br> but at that time, she was kind of following into her mom's footsteps. Her</br> mom was kind of really into synthetic weed, which is K2, they called it</br> back then. And it would really mess with your head.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She got really into it because of her mom, and I noticed that because</br> of her mom, because she didn't used to do it, then her mom started doing it</br> in the house, and she got into it. Apparently, she sold the car, she sold a</br> lot of my stuff and...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, to get the drugs.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. To get the drugs or just to party, do whatever and she ended up</br> not doing anything. The car, she could have kept it for herself and used</br> it. She ended up buying another car later on, a couple years later, not</br> even as good of a car as the one I had. TV, she didn't even have the TV for</br> a while. At one point, to me, I thought it was karma at first. I was like,</br> I gave her a lot of stuff, I even gave her the apartment where I lived. I</br> told her that you can live in that apartment, it's under my dad's name,</br> nobody's going to charge you rent, nothing. It's a free apartment, you can</br> stay there and you can have your own place now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She didn't want none of that. And then one day, I don't know what</br> happened. Her mom fell asleep with a cigarette or something, house caught</br> on fire, everything burnt. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, but all of the</br> clothes, everything got lost. I'm like, &quot;You see? Your TV got lost, all</br> your furniture got lost, your everything, all this stuff got lost.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;You could have had all that stuff if you would have stayed at my</br> apartment. You would have had your own personal stuff, nothing like that</br> would have happened.&quot; I was like, &quot;But you took advantage of it, you took</br> it all and did I don't know what with it. I'm not going to ask you, I</br> really don't care. I gave it to you, so I'm not going to expect an</br> explanations on it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And she got mad at me because of that. She got mad because I told her</br> that stuff. I was like, &quot;Well, I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying</br> look, sometimes things happen for a reason.&quot; I was like, &quot;Everything</br> happens for a reason, I believe that.&quot; My mom didn't like that about me.</br> She didn't like the fact that I was so accepting of the things that</br> happened to me in life. She was like, &quot;You shouldn't be like just oh well,</br> everything happens for a reason or shouldn't be too upbeat about stuff.&quot;</br> Not upbeat, but yeah, upbeat. I shouldn't be taking it so good, so lightly.</br> She wanted me to take it more heavily. She's like, &quot;Hey, you're getting in</br> trouble. You're going to get deported. You should be taking it more</br> heavily, you should be upset.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, &quot;Mom, everything happens for a reason. Everything happens</br> for a reason. Every single thing is either whether you believe it or not,</br> everything happens for a reason. There is already a plan for you type</br> thing.&quot; I believe in that type of stuff and I went to church when I was</br> younger. I did go to church when I was in junior high, and it was nice. It</br> taught me a lot of stuff and I do believe in God. I'm not going to say I'm</br> a follower, but I do believe in Him and I do believe in what they believe</br> here, which is La Santa Muerte, [Saint Death] and I believe in death.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If there's one thing that everybody believes in, it's death. Because</br> everybody says, nothing is promised but death. That's one for sure thing</br> that we all have is that. Believing in the death here, believing in La</br> Santa Muerte [Saint Death] like the guys, it's a lot more credible. It's</br> like yeah, we know death is there. God, everybody says God is here, there's</br> the books and the testaments, there's no really actual evidence besides the</br> books. Yeah, there's some stuff that do... I like that type of stuff and it</br> gets my mind over, but I was never too much of a follower. My mom didn't</br> like that. She was like, &quot;You need to take it seriously.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br> am, but it's already happened. It's already done and it's already</br> happening, it's in process, what can I do about it? I can just hope for the</br> best and prepare for the worst.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, you seem to have dealt with your anger management issues.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years of therapy did help out a lot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I was going to say, you didn't get angry at this. You should be happy</br> that you didn't angry.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years that I did inside the juvie, every day was</br> therapy. It was therapy every single day, one hour of therapy every day and</br> we had at least a one hour session, a personal session twice a week. Those</br> really helped a lot. They did help a lot on my anger. At this point in</br> time, my mom doesn't like the fact that I don't get angry. She's like,</br> &quot;This stuff should make you mad. The stuff that should make you mad,</br> doesn't make you mad and the stuff that shouldn't make you mad, you get mad</br> about small stuff like...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get mad about stuff as if I was an OCD type thing. I would get mad</br> because somebody grabbed something and then leaves it over here on the</br> couch and doesn't put it back on the table. I'll get mad at stuff like</br> that. That upsets me more than, &quot;Hey, this person's talking bad about you.&quot;</br> My mom is really picky about that. My family members are really nosy.</br> They're always like, &quot;Hey, did you see what Axel published on Facebook?&quot; I</br> mean, it could be just a funny picture about a certain thing, but just</br> because I posted it, they think I'm doing those things or I'm into those</br> things. I'm like, it's just something I found funny and I wanted to share</br> with people. I'm not doing it.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's like, &quot;You know how your family is.&quot; So now it got to the</br> point where I can't even express myself on social media just because of my</br> family? I'm like, &quot;Mom, you know that I'm not doing that stuff. You talk to</br> me every day. And they're not helping me, they're not supporting me,</br> they're not doing anything for me. So why let them affect anything that has</br> to do with me?&quot; She's like, &quot;I just don't like telling me.&quot; I'm like,</br> &quot;Ignore them, block them. If they're really family, they shouldn't be doing</br> that type of stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She's like, &quot;Why are you taking it so lightly? You should be mad, you</br> should get mad that people are talking about you.&quot; I was like, &quot;Mom, at</br> this point in time, I don't really care what people say about me, because I</br> know who I am. I know who I am and what I do. If they say it, if it's true,</br> okay. I know it's true. If they say it and it's not true, okay. It's not</br> true.&quot; I don't care. Okay, go ahead, say it all you want to. I know it's</br> not true, it doesn't affect me at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get more mad at people talking about my family, talking about my</br> inner circle, my friends or anything like that. If somebody says something</br> about a family member, I'm definitely getting physical with that person or</br> if somebody says something about a friend of mine that's close by, I will</br> confront them about it. Be like, &quot;Hey, if you're going to say something</br> about them, say it when they're here, say it to their face. Don't be</br> talking about all that right now when they're not here and they can't</br> defend themselves.&quot; I'm not into that, I don't like that at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm more likely to get into a fight or into a physical altercation</br> with somebody or even verbal altercation with someone, because of them</br> saying something about somebody I care about than them saying... They could</br> say the most horrible things about me and I just brush it off my shoulders.</br> I really don't care because I know who I am. But if they anything either</br> minor or whatever it is about somebody I care about, that upsets me a lot</br> because they have no reason to say it, they don't know the person or the</br> person's not even there. So I'm like, &quot;Hey.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If the person is there, I'll be like, &quot;Hey, defend yourself, man.&quot;</br> They're like me. They're like, &quot;It's not even true, I don't really care.&quot;</br> I'm like, &quot;All right, cool. Let's just ignore them then.&quot; But I'm more</br> likely like that. My mom told me that too. She's literally learned that on.</br> She's like, &quot;Yeah, I noticed that.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a heart of gold,</br> but you let people take advantage of you and let people step over you and</br> stuff like that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I don't really care about that. I know what my</br> life is, I know what I do with my life, I know exactly where I'm going,</br> what I'm doing with my life. If people want to say all this stuff, okay.</br> They can say it. I can either let it affect me and bring me down or I can</br> let it affect me and I go at them or I go physically with them or go argue</br> with them, whatever. Or I can just let them say what they want to say and</br> act like nothing was said at all.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;It's not affecting me.&quot; If it gets to the point where</br> it's affecting me, like maybe they're talking about me and my wife or</br> talking about me doing something that is going to upset my wife and now my</br> wife is upset with me or something like that, it's causing problems in my</br> personal life, then yeah. I will get upset at that point, but if you want</br> to say, &quot;Hey, Axel's this, Axel's that, Axel did this and oh, he's this and</br> that. I heard he also was into this.&quot; All right, cool. But if you say</br> something like, &quot;Hey, did you know Axel was messing around with this girl</br> and even his wife doesn't know?&quot; And then all of a sudden my wife is like,</br> &quot;Oh, really?&quot; So now she's mad at me for something I didn't do just because</br> they said it. Okay, so now I'm going to get upset because now you're making</br> my wife, my ex, my girl, whatever it is, you're making my parents upset</br> because of that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When my mom calls me and tells me all that stuff about my family</br> members, I don't get upset at my mom. My mom's like, &quot;Hey, they're all</br> saying this and this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom, just ignore them.&quot; She's</br> like, &quot;No, how can you just ignore it?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom.&quot; I was like, &quot;Look,</br> I never hear them say anything or see them say anything. You're the one</br> that tells me. I get upset at you because you're telling me all this stuff</br> that you already know and it's upsetting me that you get upset, and it</br> upsets me that the fact that they're making you upset. I'm upset at you for</br> letting them get you upset and I'm upset at them for even worrying about</br> that stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You never worried about me when I was in the States and when I was</br> going through all that jail time. None of you wanted to help me out with a</br> recommendation card because you were like, &quot;Oh no, because if we put our</br> information on there, they're going to have us on record and they're going</br> to come looking for us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, it's nothing like that. They're not</br> even asking for your address. They just want your name and they want you to</br> write something good about me, something that you know about me. Stuff that</br> you're saying that I'm a good person to society.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, I had recommendation cards from the church where I used to go,</br> church friends, some school teachers. I had a recommendation from a lot of</br> places but my family members were never there. And that's why now that</br> they're all worried about what I'm doing over here, I'm like, come on now.</br> If I was over there and things went bad over there, where my mom was</br> actually at and where she was able to actually get to know me and punish me</br> in some way, and nothing helped over there, what makes you think that if</br> I'm doing whatever you think I'm doing over here, you telling my mom is</br> going to do anything? If it didn't work over there when I was there</br> physically, it's not going to work over the phone. Come on now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I got to the point where my Facebook, it's nothing but family members</br> and I know that I cannot put anything on there because it's nothing but my</br> family. Any other social media, I can do whatever I want but Facebook is</br> strictly family, strictly professional.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you got to watch stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, I have a last question for you. That is what are your dreams?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My dreams? I always had the same dream since I was younger. I always</br> liked what I saw between my mom and my stepdad, and I always wanted a</br> family. At this point, I got three babies with three different moms, and my</br> mom tells me, &quot;You need to stop.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just trying to have my</br> family.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a family.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, but I want</br> that family like you and my dad had.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that's always been my dream, to have my... I don't want fancy</br> stuff, I don't want to be rich, I don't want to be famous, none of that. I</br> just want to be able to have a family of my own. Be able to live with them,</br> be with them, actually see my kids grow up, see them become the young man</br> that they're going to be, the older man that they're going to be, instead</br> of just having to talk to them over the phone.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: There was a point in time, when I moved around, when I first got</br> here, moved in a place around here. That's where my family is at. I don't</br> have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over</br> there, since I had first got there, I was struggling. I didn't have a</br> phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,</br> anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a</br> year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the</br> minutes and stuff, since it was a little place, you had to go buy a card</br> with minutes to call. Once the card was over, you had to buy another card</br> or they had to pay and it wasn't good.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little</br> young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's</br> always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm</br> not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom</br> provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and</br> be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing</br> something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they</br> need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than</br> myself. Like I said, shoe brands, all that stuff don't matter to me. I want</br> to have my family, I want to be happy and make my kids happy. See my family</br> grow and see my kids grow. See what they become, because I expect them...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: People always ask me. &quot;Hey.&quot; Because I did smoke before, I did smoke</br> weed and everything but they're like, &quot;Hey, what if your kid one day did</br> something like that?&quot; I was like, the only thing I really wish, I never</br> really saw that bad. Obviously, they're legalizing it for a reason in</br> certain states.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="28c0d4e5-8ee3-44e6-ba99-1e7d16778959" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family">Axel: I just wish my kids would tell me. I want them to have that<br>
 confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to<br>
 have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in<br>
 the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be<br>
 safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,<br>
 go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see<br>
 me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that<br>
 stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All<br>
 right.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but<br>
 at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to<br>
 help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be<br>
 able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm<br>
 not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's<br>
 why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that<br>
 they could say, &quot;Hey, your dad's never there.&quot; He's like, &quot;No, but he's<br>
 always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him<br>
 emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me<br>
 that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in<br>
 my life important.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my<br>
 wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't<br>
 have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from<br>
 here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We<br>
 weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just<br>
 felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were<br>
 going to grow up and be like, &quot;Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did<br>
 everything. He's the one that get the money.&quot; She's like, &quot;I want to feel<br>
 like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own<br>
 heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I was like, &quot;Yeah, you don't have to say that it's my part or<br>
 anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own<br>
 stuff.&quot; She's like, &quot;No, but I just still feel like it's difficult.&quot; So<br>
 right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix<br>
 things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,<br>
 and I understand my mom too at the same time like, &quot;Hey, you don't want to<br>
 go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do<br>
 you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.&quot;<br>

 &quot;Ignore them, block t</span><span id="532a6100-761b-476a-ab8a-b02688d446eb" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Mental Health">Axel: I get mad about stuff as if I was an OCD type thing. I would get mad<br>
 because somebody grabbed something and then leaves it over here on the<br>
 couch and doesn't put it back on the table. I'll get mad at stuff like<br>
 that. That upsets me more than, &quot;Hey, this person's talking bad about you.&quot;<br>
 My mom is really picky about that. My family members are really nosy.<br>
 They're always like, &quot;Hey, did you see what Axel published on Facebook?&quot; I<br>
 mean, it could be just a funny picture about a certain thing, but just<br>
 because I posted it, they think I'm doing those things or I'm into those<br>
 things. I'm like, it's just something I found funny and I wanted to share<br>
 with people. I'm not doing it.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: My mom's like, &quot;You know how your family is.&quot; So now it got to the<br>
 point where I can't even express myself on social media just because of my<br>
 family? I'm like, &quot;Mom, you know that I'm not doing that stuff. You talk to<br>
 me every day. And they're not helping me, they're not supporting me,<br>
 they're not doing anything for me. So why let them affect anything that has<br>
 to do with me?&quot; She's like, &quot;I just don't like telling me.&quot; I'm like,<br>
 &quot;Ignore them, block them. If they're really family, they shouldn't be doing<br>
 that type of stuff.&quot;<br>

 therapy. It was therapy every single day, one hour of therapy every day and<br>
 we had at least a one hour session, a personal session twice a week. Those<br>
 really helped a lot. They did help a lot on my anger. At this point in<br>
 time, my mom doesn't like the fact that I don't get angry. She's like,<br>
 &quot;This stuff should make you mad. The stuff that should make you mad,<br>
 doesn't make you mad and the stuff that shouldn't make you mad, you get mad<br>
 about small stuff like...&quot;<br>

 happened. Her mom fell asleep with a cigarette or something, house caught<br>
 on fire, everything burnt. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, but all of the<br>
 clothes, everything got lost. I'm like, &quot;You see? Your TV got lost, all<br>
 your furniture got lost, your everything, all this stuff got lost.&quot; I was<br>
 like, &quot;You could have had all that stuff if you would have stayed at my<br>
 apartment. You would have had your own personal stuff, nothing like that<br>
 would have happened.&quot; I was like, &quot;But you took advantage of it, you took<br>
 it all and did I don't know what with it. I'm not going to ask you, I<br>
 really don't care. I gave it to you, so I'm not going to expect an<br>
 explanations on it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: And she got mad at me because of that. She got mad because I told her<br>
 that stuff. I was like, &quot;Well, I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying<br>
 look, sometimes things happen for a reason.&quot; I was like, &quot;Everything<br>
 happens for a reason, I believe that.&quot; My mom didn't like that about me.<br>
 She didn't like the fact that I was so accepting of the things that<br>
 happened to me in life. She was like, &quot;You shouldn't be like just oh well,<br>
 everything happens for a reason or shouldn't be too upbeat about stuff.&quot;<br>
 Not upbeat, but yeah, upbeat. I shouldn't be taking it so good, so lightly.<br>
 She wanted me to take it more heavily. She's like, &quot;Hey, you're getting in<br>
 trouble. You're going to get deported. You should be taking it more<br>
 heavily, you should be upset.&quot;<br>

 not doing anything. The car, she could have kept it for herself and used<br>
 it. She ended up buying another car later on, a couple years later, not<br>
 even as good of a car as the one I had. TV, she didn't even have the TV for<br>
 a while. At one point, to me, I thought it was karma at first. I was like,<br>
 I gave her a lot of stuff, I even gave her the apartment where I lived. I<br>
 told her that you can live in that apartment, it's under my dad's name,<br>
 nobody's going to charge you rent, nothing. It's a free apartment, you can<br>
 stay there and you can have your own place now.<br>

 lot of furnitures, TV, everything. All of that, I gave it all to my baby's<br>
 mom. The newer baby. And she kept me everything. I had a nice car, had a<br>
 nice TV, everything, I had nice furniture. Not going to say she was the<br>
 best of moms at that time, but now she is. Now she's doing a lot better,<br>
 but at that time, she was kind of following into her mom's footsteps. Her<br>
 mom was kind of really into synthetic weed, which is K2, they called it<br>
 back then. And it would really mess with your head.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: She got really into it because of her mom, and I noticed that because<br>
 of her mom, because she didn't used to do it, then her mom started doing it<br>
 in the house, and she got into it. Apparently, she sold the car, she sold a<br>
 lot of my stuff and...<br>

 She's tried to help me out, I'm like, &quot;No, I'm alright right now. The day I<br>
 need help, don't worry, I will ask you. Don't worry, you're the only person<br>
 I can count on. So I know that whenever I need some help, I either got to<br>
 call you or my dad.&quot; I was like, &quot;But right now, just help my daughters<br>
 out. Since you're over there, just help them out. Either they need milk,<br>
 diapers, whatever it is they need, just help them out.&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm<br>
 doing my own thing over here, I'm helping my baby that I have over here and<br>
 my stepson and I'm buying clothes to send over there, and plus I'm trying<br>
 to make a life over here for myself also, but I also want to know that<br>
 they're okay over there.&quot;<br>

 really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a<br>
 couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check<br>
 again. I was like, &quot;Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're<br>
 going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have<br>
 my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed<br>
 to have alcohol at all.&quot; I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for<br>
 me, so I panicked, I stepped on the gas and I left.<br>

 they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My<br>
 parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and<br>
 fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of<br>
 that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody<br>
 because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or<br>
 leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Axel: So they threw me in county and I was fighting my case while I was in</br> county for about...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You're 12 or 13?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting</br> it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were</br> trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,</br> something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea</br> of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time</br> or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting</br> immigration.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: In the end, I've got a deal with the judge. They were going to extend</br> my probation for another year. We got that deal on a Friday. By the time</br> that the judge closed the deal and everything on my lawyer, it was already</br> 4:30 in the afternoon. The probation office is closed at five. They were</br> like, &quot;Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you</br> have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so</br> that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up</br> here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation</br> office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone</br> number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already</br> get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take</br> your probation and you're already registered into it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.&quot; I'm already signing the</br> paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just</br> got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend</br> I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I</br> know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it</br> seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular</br> clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.</br> Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except</br> me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm</br> like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and</br> everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like</br> immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.</br> So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way</br> you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you</br> don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, I’m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the</br> people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really</br> disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called</br> my parents and my friends were like, &quot;Hey, are you out already? Where are</br> you so we can go pick you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm inside my cell.&quot; And they're</br> like, &quot;What, why?&quot; I was like, &quot;Apparently, immigration put a hold on me</br> this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,</br> they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then</br> once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why</br> are you here still?&quot; And they were like, &quot;Oh well, it's because you have an</br> immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back</br> in.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,</br> three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were</br> trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,</br> when my judge got the deal where they were like, &quot;Okay, this is what we're</br> going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and</br> you're only going to do two years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: But you didn't do anything. You've been in jail all this time.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're like, &quot;We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of</br> a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed</br> your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your</br> probation.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile</br> for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you</br> therapy sessions for anger management.&quot; He's like, &quot;They also talk about</br> drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,</br> so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your</br> personal sessions also to help you with your issues.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And I was like, &quot;Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least</br> you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,</br> anything like that.&quot; &quot;No, no. Those options aren't available for you.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your</br> court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.&quot; Even my lawyer told</br> me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in</br> juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new</br> again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,</br> new everything was a little bit different in two years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did you go back to school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I</br> used to go. Everybody was like, &quot;Where were you last two years?&quot; Somebody</br> started a rumor I was in Canada. Some people knew where I were, because I</br> kept in contact with a couple people and they knew exactly where I were.</br> Everything went back to normal once I got back to school. Once I got off,</br> they did give me six months of probation and I didn't do anything. I was</br> doing exactly what they wanted me. From work, from house to school, from</br> school to the house. No time in between at all, no walks with anybody,</br> nothing. It was like all right, going to school, cool. Got to school,</br> school's out, okay, I'm going home. &quot;Hey, come stay, come go for an ice</br> cream.&quot; Nope.

 Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular<br>
 clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.<br>
 Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except<br>
 me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm<br>
 like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and<br>
 everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like<br>
 immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.<br>
 So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,<br>
 &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way<br>
 you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you<br>
 don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;<br>

 it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were<br>
 trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,<br>
 something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea<br>
 of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time<br>

 they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My<br>
 parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and<br>
 fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of<br>
 that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody<br>

 The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the<br>
 car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,<br>
 everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I<br>
 at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never<br>
 tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's<br>
 something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they<br>
 don't have one, and they're like, &quot;You'll never want to say that you don't<br>
 have it. You just want to say you forgot it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, &quot;Okay, next time, make sure you<br>
 have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with<br>
 you.&quot; Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take<br>
 your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be<br>
 driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you<br>
 can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that<br>
 fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You<br>
 couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for<br>
 legal...They actually ran the social security check.<br>

 the guys ran into those areas. The police officers were around the corner,<br>
 the lady ran to them, she told them, the police came. They're like, &quot;Who is<br>
 it?&quot; They were looking at me. I was like, &quot;No, no. It wasn't me.&quot; I was<br>
 like, &quot;It wasn't me, definitely not, but I saw it happen.&quot; I was like,<br>
 &quot;Yeah, they ran up that way. Yeah, like she said, it was two guys, blah,<br>
 blah, blah.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Gave them all the information, they're like, &quot;Okay. Well, man, what<br>
 we're going to suggest you do is go down to the court office, or the place<br>
 where you make charges, and lift the charge pretty much about what<br>
 happened.&quot; He's like, &quot;Because right now, if we go up there into that area,<br>
 there could be more of them and they could also take our stuff, rob us or<br>
 maybe even jump us or we could go up there right now and they're probably<br>
 already gone inside a safe house or some friend's house. The chances of us<br>
 getting your stuff back right now are literally zero to none. It's not<br>
 worth the risk for us to go up there.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I'm like, huh. I was like, you're the police, you've got guns. What's<br>
 the point of you getting guns and you being trained and everything if<br>
 you're not going to go into the areas where the people are that are doing<br>
 the bad stuff?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
</span> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I learned that at a young age. Well, not a young age but early point</br> in time when I got to Mexico. I quickly learned that. I saw that firsthand</br> and I was like, all right, so they're not going to help. They're not going</br> to help at all unless you physically caught the person or you know exactly</br> where that person is at, then they'll go and help you get them, if it's not</br> a area where it's known for heavy trafficking and stuff. They won't go in</br> there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Could we talk about what happened to you in the United States to make</br> you end up here?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a</br> younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had</br> anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you</br> know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for</br> some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising</br> my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my</br> family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad</br> was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the</br> moment.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was</br> always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. &quot;Look, the day that</br> I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise</br> my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues</br> going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm</br> paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still</br> AB type student.&quot; But I don't know.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,</br> that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger</br> just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was</br> a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me</br> probation for two years. When I was 12, I was supposed to be off but at a</br> year and a half, a year and eight months, they told me they were going to</br> give me a lie detector test, the polygraph test, which I was not aware of.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: About what?</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="afb4bed6-009b-4a3f-99ed-3e9783533ed3" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Detention, Juvenile">Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going<br>
 to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to<br>
 meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a<br>
 year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,<br>
 &quot;Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just<br>
 going to do a polygraph test.&quot; I heard about them and I heard that some<br>
 people were like, &quot;Yeah, they don't really work.&quot; But I had my doubts about<br>
 that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.<br>
 If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know<br>
 that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an<br>
 advantage of people.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There<br>
 were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't<br>
 supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since<br>
 I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an<br>
 assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people<br>
 younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to<br>
 all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my<br>
 school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also<br>
 hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at<br>
 because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.<br>
 If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.<br>

 made the report so it must be something that really happened. Well, police,<br>
 they won't do anything. I found that out almost a week or two after I got<br>
 to Mexico. A lady got robbed for her purse. There's this area that<br>
 everybody knows and they're like, &quot;You don't want to go in that area.&quot;<br>
 Because it looks beautiful and everything because the houses are all<br>
 different colors, they're painted all nicely and they look real nice, but<br>
 everybody's like, &quot;You do not want to go down there.&quot; It was like, if you<br>
 go in there, you're probably not going to come out or you're probably going<br>
 to come out, but you're going to come out without your phone, your wallet,<br>
 sometimes even throw you out just all naked, just for the hell of it.<br>

 too much like you don't know what you're doing, they come at you like,<br>
 &quot;Hey, what are you doing here? Who are you looking for? Are you trying to<br>
 connect stuff, are you trying to find somebody with some type of substance<br>
 or something?&quot; Like no, I'm just trying to find the street here. I don't<br>
 know where I'm at. Most of these streets don't even have names. They're<br>
 covered or they're blocked by little taco stands. That's not bad.<br>

 little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type<br>

 on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,<br>
 hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and<br>
 everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But<br>
 at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live<br>
 and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.<br>

 school, and they're actually pretty good at it and they told me about their<br>
 life here and they're the ones that show me around or explain to me some<br>

 already had a baby. I had a stepson and then I was going to have my son,<br>
 and also to buy stuff here and send it over there for my daughter. I don't<br>
 send them money because I know the money that I could send a whole paycheck<br>
 from that I get right now, and it would be like maybe $100 or $150 for<br>
 them, almost nothing. So I know that instead of doing that, I know I could<br>
 buy some stuff here. Toys, shoes, clothes and I could send to them, my<br>
 parents will cover the fee of paying the shipping and I know it will help<br>
 them a lot more than me sending them $100 or something like that, and it<br>
 would affect me a lot more here.<br>

 baby terms for me so I can understand it. It's just like... Besides that, I<br>
 found that kind of hard but I would never leave school because of that. I<br>
 was willing to struggle with it but like I said, once I had my baby and<br>
 everything here, then everything just... I had to put all that aside so I<br>
 could focus on the money because the job that I had at that point wasn't<br>

 it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words<br>

 kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and<br>
 me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my<br>
 home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.<br>
 So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my<br>
 first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and<br>
 it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff<br>
 a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more<br>
 understanding and I was getting it really quick.<br>

 We used to work together, he was just my partner, in a way.&quot; I mean, my dad<br>
 doesn't seem like he has any hard feelings about it, but he never remarried<br>
 again, so I don't know what happened there. But my mom got remarried and<br>
 now it's been like, I don't know, I suppose right now it's been about<br>
 almost 20 years? And he's never remarried, he's never really bothered, I’ve<br>

 away, and within that little range, it's probably the biggest mission ever.<br>
 People talk about the areas where they have all the drugs, they beat them<br>
 or places like that where it's supposedly heavy, and really, I've gone to<br>
 those areas because I have friends and people that live in those areas and<br>
 I've gone to visit them, and the cops are there in that area, they're right<br>
 outside of the locations where they're selling stuff. They can smell the<br>
 stuff, they can see people going in and out of the place, but they don't go<br>
 in the place. They do checks on everybody that comes out of there, to try<br>
 to see if maybe they can catch them slipping up and get some money off of<br>
 them, a phone, whatever they can, but they will never go inside of the<br>
 location where they see everybody going in and out of.<br>

</span><span id="fbb38f59-eab7-47f3-bea0-9f18890634b2" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Living situation">Axel: Went over when I was really young, about a year or two years old, so<br>
 I didn't know much about it but what my parents told me once I got older<br>
 was where we lived, it was a small ranch type area,</span> and there was a lot of</br> narc activity going there and it got to the point where one of my uncles</br> got injured in some type of crossfire, and so they wanted to avoid that for</br> us and they also wanted a better life for themselves and see for their</br> whole planning the family type part, so they decided they wanted to come to</br> the States. And they came, they crossed over when I was really young. My</br> mom told me that she carried me in her arms whenever she crossed me over,</br> and so it was... I don't have any idea about it, but that's what she told</br> me. I kind of have an imagination of what kind of went down.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you said you had siblings, were they with you at the time?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No. When we went over there, I was the only child. Once I got over</br> there, then my mom and my dad got divorced when I was around four. My mom</br> already had my stepdad kind of on the side and my dad knew my stepdad,</br> actually. They actually used to be coworkers together, so even to this day,</br> they still talk to each other and they get along whenever it comes down to</br> family situations, they get along. They can sit in front of each other and</br> talk and stuff. But once they separated, that's when my mom had my</br> stepsister, my stepbrother and my other stepsister. As in my dad and my</br> mom, I was the only child.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I never really had my own... All my brothers and sisters, it was</br> once I was already older, about... My sister's 17 now, so I was about seven</br> or eight.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Nice. What was the city that you moved to when you first moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first moved over there, we were in Texas, and then mom was</br> always big about moving around. She always wanted to... It was always her</br> idea of looking for a better life, the American dream, whatever you say. So</br> she was always trying to upgrade to a new house and better location for</br> schools, better location for a family, stuff like that. So we went all over</br> Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Moving a lot and at that point, it kind of was something that I</br> didn't enjoy really, because I wanted a stable home, something where I</br> could build some friendships and know that I was going to have those</br> friendships there for the long run. And I'd just be like, &quot;Oh yeah, we'll</br> probably be here for a year and then my mom's going to want to move again</br> and I'm going to have to start a whole new life all over.&quot; That's at the</br> point I decided I wanted to go live with my dad. My dad had been living in</br> the same area for about 10 years, so I was like, that is not going to be an</br> issue at all, for him to move. He hasn't moved in 10 years, he's not going</br> to move at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And once I moved over there, he did move a block or two down, just so</br> we can go ahead and get a bigger apartment than where he was, because he</br> was just living in a single bedroom apartment for himself because he never</br> remarried after my mom. Once I moved with him, he moved about two blocks</br> down just to another apartment where it was bigger space, where I could</br> stay with him and from there, we never moved again. That's when I started</br> doing from like seventh grade, all the way up till I finished my last six</br> years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Half of it, mom was everywhere and then the other half, I was in a</br> stable location where I actually met the friends that I have now that still</br> talk to me now that I'm here and that still help me whenever they can. I</br> don't even have to ask them, they'll just tell me, &quot;Hey, right now I'm</br> going to send you some money or I'm going to do this, I'm going to give</br> your kids something, where can I meet them? Blah, blah, blah.&quot; I know that</br> they're going to help me, but I don't like to ask them because it's not</br> something that I don't really like to ask them for, for stuff because I</br> know it's not their fault that I got deported or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Same with my family, because my mom always told me, she's like,</br> &quot;Trust me, you don't want to go to Mexico.&quot; She's like, &quot;Life over there is</br> not as you picture it. It's like your cousins and everything, they say</br> they're having fun over there, but they've been over there they're whole</br> life.&quot; He's like, &quot;You? You're going to have difficulties.&quot; One, is the</br> tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for</br> y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family</br> over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her</br> a couple times and tell her that they have me and, &quot;We have your son and</br> you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But she always have someone with her like my sister or my stepdad or</br> something, and while she's on the phone with them, then my stepdad, my</br> sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can</br> just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that</br> has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They</br> worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of</br> myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle</br> myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because</br> they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just</br> everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in</br> transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff</br> because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next</br> thing you know, you're just like, &quot;Oh, my wallet, my phone's gone.&quot; I don't</br> even know where it happened, nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And authorities don't really do much to help. They almost kind of get</br> mad at you for getting robbed. They're like, &quot;We told you not to have your</br> things out in the open, we told you to check your pockets and make sure you</br> have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can</br> feel that you're getting to get them swiped out.&quot; It's not really a big</br> help. Then it comes down to that part, they're like, &quot;Well, it's gone now.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;Whoever it was, wherever they are now, it's gone.&quot; And it's</br> like, man, it's his...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And there's videos that I've seen about that stuff and it's just</br> like, it's not even just one person. It's a group of people that huddle on</br> you and it's just regular people, it's older people, it's not just young</br> people like kids and people my age, adults and people. It's also older</br> people like grandparents or just old little ladies. Couple ladies, they</br> come in and they'd be in a little group, they try asking you for</br> directions, one of them is distracting you, the other one is taking stuff</br> out of your pocket. Then she hands it off to someone else that's behind</br> them, that person walks away. Someone else comes in like a distraction</br> like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in it together and at the end, some people start to act</br> like they're actually caring about what's going on. In the end, they're all</br> in cahoots with it. You can't trust anybody. In the States, at least you</br> knew you could help somebody and it's probably legit. Over here, you can't</br> really trust that thing where somebody comes up to you and they're like,</br> &quot;Hey, I need some help, something's going on right here around the corner.</br> Somebody's trying to hurt my mom or somebody's trying to hurt my sister.&quot;</br> You can't even trust that because you might go around the corner and</br> they're just going to jump you and rob you. It's all just in cahoots to get</br> something out of you.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: More over here where we live, or where we work, it used to be a lot</br> calmer, but now it got to the point where they've considered it a red spot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, because they say there's too much going around the area, as far</br> as with drugs, with the robbings. People know that obviously we get some</br> decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.</br> The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we</br> get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking</br> and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.</br> It's probable cause, supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And if they catch you with something, they won't take you to jail.</br> They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from</br> you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't</br> offer them the money or say, &quot;I'm not going to give you any money,&quot; they'll</br> scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give</br> you a last chance. They're like, &quot;Okay, last chance before we get there,</br> it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or</br> you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want</br> is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.</br> It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me</br> and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the</br> fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we</br> get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our</br> attitude that we take against them.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Then it's like, all right, I had a cop one time, I didn't have</br> anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,</br> everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just</br> bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give</br> away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They</br> caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, &quot;Why do</br> you have two phones?&quot; Like thought I stole one. I'm like, &quot;No, I didn't.</br> All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The guy didn't like my whole attitude that I had with them, so he</br> decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I</br> think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a</br> big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, &quot;Look, I've</br> got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of</br> your phones,&quot; He's like, &quot;And actually, the one I want is that one.&quot; He</br> wanted the brand new one. &quot;And actually, I want this one. So look, this is</br> the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,</br> or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that</br> anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go</br> with me.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go</br> ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got</br> with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="cbb6e4ea-e229-48e6-942f-ea0ffc03df57" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Interactions with police, Stops, Bribes">Axel: Obviously, I'm not going to risk it. I didn't believe him at the same<br>
 time, but since they do always take money and any other types of bribes, so<br>
 I'm like, I'm not going to risk it, try to play the brave guy and be like,<br>
 &quot;All right, go ahead and take me,&quot; and stuff, and then they do it, and then<br>
 I'm going to be like, &quot;Oh no, never mind.&quot; They might even end up taking<br>
 both of my phones or anything like that. I have friends that because they<br>
 said no and they refused to give the phone, they put it inside their pants<br>
 so the cops couldn't get it, they ended up beating them up. They would just<br>
 grab them and beat them and, &quot;All right, there you go. You can go on about<br>
 your merry way. We didn't get nothing from you, but we at least gave you a<br>
 beating. Maybe you'll learn.&quot;<br>

</span> Axel: Went over when I was really young, about a year or two years old, so</br> I didn't know much about it but what my parents told me once I got older</br> was where we lived, it was a small ranch type area, and there was a lot of</br> narc activity going there and it got to the point where one of my uncles</br> got injured in some type of crossfire, and so they wanted to avoid that for</br> us and they also wanted a better life for themselves and see for their</br> whole planning the family type part, so they decided they wanted to come to</br> the States. And they came, they crossed over when I was really young. My</br> mom told me that she carried me in her arms whenever she crossed me over,</br> and so it was...

Once I got over</br> there, then my mom and my dad got divorced when I was around four. My mom</br> already had my stepdad kind of on the side and my dad knew my stepdad,</br> actually. They actually used to be coworkers together, so even to this day,</br> they still talk to each other and they get along whenever it comes down to</br> family situations, they get along. They can sit in front of each other and</br> talk and stuff. But once they separated, that's when my mom had my</br> stepsister, my stepbrother and my other stepsister. As in my dad and my</br> mom, I was the only child.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I never really had my own... All my brothers and sisters, it was</br> once I was already older, about... My sister's 17 now, so I was about seven</br> or eight.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Nice. What was the city that you moved to when you first moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first moved over there, we were in Texas, and then mom was</br> always big about moving around. She always wanted to... It was always her</br> idea of looking for a better life, the American dream, whatever you say. So</br> she was always trying to upgrade to a new house and better location for</br> schools, better location for a family, stuff like that. So we went all over</br> Texas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Moving a lot and at that point, it kind of was something that I</br> didn't enjoy really, because I wanted a stable home, something where I</br> could build some friendships and know that I was going to have those</br> friendships there for the long run.

It's like your cousins and everything, they say</br> they're having fun over there, but they've been over there they're whole</br> life.&quot; He's like, &quot;You? You're going to have difficulties.&quot; One, is the</br> tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for</br> y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family</br> over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her</br> a couple times and tell her that they have me and, &quot;We have your son and</br> you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But she always have someone with her like my sister or my stepdad or</br> something, and while she's on the phone with them, then my stepdad, my</br> sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can</br> just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that</br> has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They</br> worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of</br> myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle</br> myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because</br> they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just</br> everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in</br> transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff</br> because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next</br> thing you know, you're just like, &quot;Oh, my wallet, my phone's gone.&quot; I don't</br> even know where it happened, nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And authorities don't really do much to help. They almost kind of get</br> mad at you for getting robbed. They're like, &quot;We told you not to have your</br> things out in the open, we told you to check your pockets and make sure you</br> have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can</br> feel that you're getting to get them swiped out.&quot; It's not really a big</br> help. Then it comes down to that part, they're like, &quot;Well, it's gone now.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;Whoever it was, wherever they are now, it's gone.&quot; And it's</br> like, man, it's his...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And there's videos that I've seen about that stuff and it's just</br> like, it's not even just one person. It's a group of people that huddle on</br> you and it's just regular people, it's older people, it's not just young</br> people like kids and people my age, adults and people. It's also older</br> people like grandparents or just old little ladies. Couple ladies, they</br> come in and they'd be in a little group, they try asking you for</br> directions, one of them is distracting you, the other one is taking stuff</br> out of your pocket. Then she hands it off to someone else that's behind</br> them, that person walks away. Someone else comes in like a distraction</br> like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in it together and at the end, some people start to act</br> like they're actually caring about what's going on. In the end, they're all</br> in cahoots with it. You can't trust anybody. In the States, at least you</br> knew you could help somebody and it's probably legit. Over here, you can't</br> really trust that thing where somebody comes up to you and they're like,</br> &quot;Hey, I need some help, something's going on right here around the corner.</br> Somebody's trying to hurt my mom or somebody's trying to hurt my sister.&quot;</br> You can't even trust that because you might go around the corner and</br> they're just going to jump you and rob you. It's all just in cahoots to get</br> something out of you.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: More over here where we live, or where we work, it used to be a lot</br> calmer, but now it got to the point where they've considered it a red spot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, because they say there's too much going around the area, as far</br> as with drugs, with the robbings. People know that obviously we get some</br> decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.</br> The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we</br> get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking</br> and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.</br> It's probable cause, supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And if they catch you with something, they won't take you to jail.</br> They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from</br> you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't</br> offer them the money or say, &quot;I'm not going to give you any money,&quot; they'll</br> scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give</br> you a last chance. They're like, &quot;Okay, last chance before we get there,</br> it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or</br> you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want</br> is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.</br> It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me</br> and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the</br> fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we</br> get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our</br> attitude that we take against them.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Then it's like, all right, I had a cop one time, I didn't have</br> anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,</br> everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just</br> bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give</br> away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They</br> caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, &quot;Why do</br> you have two phones?&quot; Like thought I stole one. I'm like, &quot;No, I didn't.</br> All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The guy didn't like my whole attitude that I had with them, so he</br> decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I</br> think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a</br> big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, &quot;Look, I've</br> got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of</br> your phones,&quot; He's like, &quot;And actually, the one I want is that one.&quot; He</br> wanted the brand new one. &quot;And actually, I want this one. So look, this is</br> the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,</br> or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that</br> anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go</br> with me.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go</br> ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got</br> with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Obviously, I'm not going to risk it. I didn't believe him at the same</br> time, but since they do always take money and any other types of bribes, so</br> I'm like, I'm not going to risk it, try to play the brave guy and be like,</br> &quot;All right, go ahead and take me,&quot; and stuff, and then they do it, and then</br> I'm going to be like, &quot;Oh no, never mind.&quot; They might even end up taking</br> both of my phones or anything like that. I have friends that because they</br> said no and they refused to give the phone, they put it inside their pants</br> so the cops couldn't get it, they ended up beating them up. They would just</br> grab them and beat them and, &quot;All right, there you go. You can go on about</br> your merry way. We didn't get nothing from you, but we at least gave you a</br> beating. Maybe you'll learn.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This area right here is not really good for us, especially at</br> nighttime. And any cops that see us, any cops or anything like that,</br> they're going to try to pull us over and find something. If they don't find</br> something or if they already know you and they don't like you, because they</br> recognize. Me, they come up to me and they almost know my name already.</br> They're like, &quot;Hey, so what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you clean today</br> too?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, like every other time. Yeah.&quot; It's like, I work</br> here. You do this every day, every day you don't get anything from me. What</br> makes you think that today's going to be different? Obviously, I know that</br> I'm not going to... That this area is not the area to be doing anything. If</br> I want to do anything at all, I'm not going to do it here at work or</br> outside of work.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's annoying sometimes, because sometimes even because of that,</br> within the two blocks, they could search you about two, maybe three times.</br> Because one guy will search you on the bikes, the guys on the bikes, then</br> you're okay, they'll search you, they'll let you go. About another block</br> later, you'll bump into guys that are just walking around and they'll</br> search you too. Another block later, the guys in the cars, the trucks are</br> going by, they'll stop in front. &quot;Hey, let me do a quick search, just</br> random.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Random.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Random?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You can be late to work just because of that. You could be 10 minutes</br> early or two minutes early, but if you get stopped twice right here at</br> least, you lost all your time right there. You're running late already to</br> work. That's either before work, during lunch, on a break, after work when</br> you're going home. It's just anytime. It got to the point where work, it's</br> a mission just to go from your work to where your transport is. Either the</br> train line, the substation or the buses. They're only about three...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The train stations are three blocks away, the bus is maybe two blocks</br> away, and within that little range, it's probably the biggest mission ever.</br> People talk about the areas where they have all the drugs, they beat them</br> or places like that where it's supposedly heavy, and really, I've gone to</br> those areas because I have friends and people that live in those areas and</br> I've gone to visit them, and the cops are there in that area, they're right</br> outside of the locations where they're selling stuff. They can smell the</br> stuff, they can see people going in and out of the place, but they don't go</br> in the place. They do checks on everybody that comes out of there, to try</br> to see if maybe they can catch them slipping up and get some money off of</br> them, a phone, whatever they can, but they will never go inside of the</br> location where they see everybody going in and out of.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's either because they're already being paid by them or it's</br> because they know that if they go in there, it's going to be some big drama</br> with the guys in there, or it's just that they don't really care anybody</br> that. They just want to make something for their day. Here, it's almost</br> just like that. There's cops everywhere, they stop you for anything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. Wow. So let's go back to the US. You're with your mom, and is</br> she working? Did she start working when you guys moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. When we first moved, yeah. She was working in a restaurant, in</br> a mall, actually. She was working inside a restaurant in the mall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And my dad was doing maintenance work at the apartments where we</br> lived.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, nice.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: We were getting, the apartment where we lived, we were getting a good</br> discount and then my mom was working a night shift or... no, wait. She was</br> doing morning shift in the mall. My dad and my mom would get off around the</br> same time. That was never really an issue with them. But once she got</br> divorced and she got with my stepdad, she stopped working. She just focused</br> more on with me, she got pregnant and started having my sister, and after</br> that, she just focused more on being a housewife. Being a housewife, being</br> a house mom.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She did great. She kept herself real busy and she always worried a</br> lot about us, tried to give us everything we needed for school, for food,</br> dress wise. Anything we needed. She did what she could with what my stepdad</br> would provide her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he also from Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. He was from Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he a citizen or was he undocumented?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No, he was also undocumented. He's still undocumented to the point.</br> He was working with my dad. They were coworkers.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, that's what you were saying. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then I don't know the whole story of how my mom and my stepdad</br> started talking, but I know they were coworkers because they've told me</br> that part before, and my dad's also told me. He's like, &quot;Yeah, I know him.</br> We used to work together, he was just my partner, in a way.&quot; I mean, my dad</br> doesn't seem like he has any hard feelings about it, but he never remarried</br> again, so I don't know what happened there. But my mom got remarried and</br> now it's been like, I don't know, I suppose right now it's been about</br> almost 20 years? And he's never remarried, he's never really bothered, I’ve</br> never met him to have a girlfriend, no other kids, nothing. After the first</br> one, he just gave up and just enjoys his house alone with the dogs and</br> stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How was school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: School? Actually, school really wasn't that bad. At first, it was a</br> little bit different, due to the language barrier, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you hadn't learned English until then. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into</br> kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and</br> me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my</br> home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.</br> So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my</br> first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and</br> it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff</br> a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more</br> understanding and I was getting it really quick.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's like they do say, once you learn it at a early age, it's kind of</br> easier than learning at a older age, once you've already got this whole</br> other concept of what you're doing. But I mean, yeah. After that, after my</br> second year of school, it was actually pretty good breeze. Breeze through.</br> Nothing like bullying, was never really an issue, anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You had lots of friends?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because of the same reasons, like I said, my mom</br> liked to move a lot, I had friends everywhere and I had certain people that</br> obviously do make some type of connection with, and you maybe stay in</br> contact with those more than anybody else or you stay in contact with that</br> person and nobody else out of the whole school or whatever. So I had</br> friends everywhere in different areas and later on, when I moved with my</br> dad, I actually bumped into one of my older friends from fourth, fifth</br> grade. I bumped into him in eighth grade and I didn't recognize him, he</br> recognized me and he was like, &quot;Yeah, I remember you. We were in this class</br> together.&quot; And he started telling me, &quot;Oh my god, I remember.&quot; And I was</br> like, what a coincidence. I was two cities away, an hour away, and now</br> you're here. We're back in the same school together.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: He started presenting me to some other friends, and obviously, there</br> was always Hispanics and there was always what they call the Chicanos, the</br> ones that were born over there but have their parents move here. That's</br> what my sisters and my brothers are considered, and they're always real</br> friendly. The racism and stuff, in areas where I lived, it never really was</br> an issue. I know I order heard about some areas where I have family members</br> that live in maybe Louisiana and Wisconsin and stuff like that, yeah, no,</br> they see a little bit more but it was never that issue where I was at.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was more, I lived in a kind of rough area, but I went to school in</br> the nice, high class schools and stuff, with people from rich neighborhoods</br> and people got to the point where they thought that my family was living</br> all right, because they had two vehicles. But it wasn't really anything</br> like that, it was just that my dad had his work truck that he used for all</br> his equipment and everything that he needed, and then he had his car that</br> was just for whenever he went somewhere to just store or just to have some</br> fun, it's not as much gas. Since he was still working with the same</br> apartment company that he's been working with, the apartment that he was</br> getting, he was now getting it for free. He didn't have to pay any rent or</br> water, nothing like that, everything was free.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So that helped a lot. It made it look like we were having a lot more</br> money than what we actually had, just because we were avoiding the rent.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. And everybody thought that but I was like, &quot;No, not really.&quot;</br> I've never been really the flashy type stuff. Everybody wanted the</br> Jordan's, all this stuff, nice. No, not me. I just wanted something... As</br> long as it looked nice and I liked the way it looked, I would buy it,</br> whether it was at a market for garage sale or was it Ross or Walmart. I</br> really didn't care much about the brands, as long as I liked it and I liked</br> the way it looks on me.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But I always found that funny that people thought that my parents had</br> more than what they actually had. I'm like, no, it's not bad, it's just</br> that my mom knows how to manage the money that my stepdad gives her and my</br> dad, he doesn't have anybody else but himself and he doesn't pay any rent</br> or anything like that. He's not wasting his money on stupid stuff either.</br> He likes to go out a lot so he goes on vacations a lot. Since he's been</br> with the company, they give a lot of vacations. He goes out, goes out of</br> the state, visits a lot of places and stuff like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was just really fun. That was the only thing that I wouldn't</br> consider bullying, my friends were just more like a teasing type thing.</br> Saying about the money. He's like, &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; I don't know why, he's like,</br> &quot;Why don't you take us out to eat?&quot; He's like, &quot;You're the one with money.&quot;</br> It was just funny to me. Then later on, they would have some racist jokes</br> in a way, but I knew that they were friends. I knew that it was just</br> teasing, messing around. It was never really serious.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, right.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Sometimes it would be like, &quot;Wow, your people don't have a lot of</br> money, blah, blah, blah.&quot; And then sometimes it was like, &quot;No, you don't</br> count. You're not even from here.&quot; It was always funny. It was never really</br> a serious... I never had really serious issues with school and bullying,</br> nothing like that. It was always pretty fun.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And over here, when I started school, it was a little bit different.</br> People do look at you different, everybody wants to ask you questions about</br> over there, ask you how to say stuff. I'm not bothered by it, but it does</br> get kind of annoying at some point. Everybody at all times, for every</br> single thing. It's just like, everybody, at all times, for every single</br> thing, and like people here go to school and they have English homework, I</br> don't mind doing that, but then when we go somewhere and they're hanging</br> out and every other thing, they're like, &quot;Hey, what is that? Or how you say</br> this or how do you do that or how do you say that or what does that mean or</br> what does this...&quot; It's like all right, I can't really do what I want to do</br> because I got to go over here and translate everything else or tell you how</br> to say all this other stuff just because. I don't mind, but it's like to a</br> certain extent, at some point, I do want to think about doing my career for</br> English. Pretty much being a teacher.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Be an English teacher?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I have the language and I just need to take the classes for</br> them to show me how to show somebody else.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But at the same time, I don't know, man. I don't want to have to</br> explain to people stuff about how to say stuff. It's kind of hard for me to</br> explain it, because it was just something that I was taught. I learned just</br> like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you were a kid.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. For me, I consider English my first language. It's really my</br> strong point. My Spanish is... Even though I spoke it at home, once I got</br> older, obviously I was always with my friends out playing video games,</br> going to basketball games, football, just doing activities, so I was never</br> home then. So my Spanish started going from pretty good to just like I can</br> get by. And now, it's getting better now, but there's certain things that I</br> still don't understand. That's why I found it a little bit harder when I</br> started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their</br> language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some</br> bigger words that I don't understand.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I</br> also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling</br> like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But</br> it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words</br> that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there</br> in class like, &quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So now he has to explain all the thing over again in simple words or</br> baby terms for me so I can understand it. It's just like... Besides that, I</br> found that kind of hard but I would never leave school because of that. I</br> was willing to struggle with it but like I said, once I had my baby and</br> everything here, then everything just... I had to put all that aside so I</br> could focus on the money because the job that I had at that point wasn't</br> all that much, and obviously, a baby is a big...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Expense, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it's a big expense and the girl I got with, my ex-wife, she</br> already had a baby. I had a stepson and then I was going to have my son,</br> and also to buy stuff here and send it over there for my daughter. I don't</br> send them money because I know the money that I could send a whole paycheck</br> from that I get right now, and it would be like maybe $100 or $150 for</br> them, almost nothing. So I know that instead of doing that, I know I could</br> buy some stuff here. Toys, shoes, clothes and I could send to them, my</br> parents will cover the fee of paying the shipping and I know it will help</br> them a lot more than me sending them $100 or something like that, and it</br> would affect me a lot more here.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: A lot more, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And it wouldn't affect them at all over there. I got that boundary</br> right there. It's different. It's a lot different. It took me almost the</br> whole year and a half or two to get used it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Get used to it, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But no, still, there's still some things that I have to learn</br> or that somebody shows me and I'm just like, &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; I've met some</br> people that are actually from here and they've learned English here, in the</br> school, and they're actually pretty good at it and they told me about their</br> life here and they're the ones that show me around or explain to me some</br> type of legal stuff or not legal stuff or maybe how stuff works around</br> here. I still learn a lot of stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This city, I know the area where I live, I know my area around here</br> where I work, and I know maybe one or two areas where some friends live, my</br> main friends, and that's it. I cannot get around. I know how to use the</br> stations for the trains, but don't tell me, &quot;Hey, come meet me over here in</br> so-and-so place or in this city or in this community.&quot; Because I'm not</br> going to. I'm not going to know. Tell me a station, I'll probably go to the</br> station and then from there, just meet me there because I'm not going to</br> get lost and I don't really trust the areas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You could tell me it's all calm, but everybody says my area is a</br> little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type</br> of situations over there. No assaults. How do they call it? People that get</br> on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,</br> hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and</br> everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But</br> at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live</br> and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.</br> They're like, &quot;Oh yeah, that's the guy, he lives over there somewhere. I</br> see him every day or I see him every two days, but I seen him a couple</br> times.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But when you go to the new area, it's like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Then you're a target.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Everybody looks at you, everybody wants to know who you are.</br> Are you some type of police officer trying to do an undercover operation or</br> something? They either come at you because they think you look suspicious</br> or they come at you because you look like a easy target and you're easy to</br> pick for, phone or something. Either way, it's just bad all around.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Or even the cops, they look at you and they see you looking around</br> too much like you don't know what you're doing, they come at you like,</br> &quot;Hey, what are you doing here? Who are you looking for? Are you trying to</br> connect stuff, are you trying to find somebody with some type of substance</br> or something?&quot; Like no, I'm just trying to find the street here. I don't</br> know where I'm at. Most of these streets don't even have names. They're</br> covered or they're blocked by little taco stands. That's not bad.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Something I like here is that there's food everywhere. There's stands</br> everywhere for everything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How does it compare--the food here to US?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I stopped eating all that fast food. In the US, it was nothing but</br> Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell. Just nothing but fast food. I think the</br> only healthy... If you consider it healthy food that I would eat over there</br> would be Chinese food, Chinese restaurants. Over here, it's all mainly, not</br> homemade, but it's handmade. Our restaurants too, fast foods, they have</br> their little machines and everything but over here it's like, you go and</br> you buy some tacos, they're cooking it right there in front of you. They</br> cut it open and cook it in front of you, they do everything right there in</br> front of you. And in the States, you go to fast food, it's like, &quot;Okay,</br> I'll order this.&quot; &quot;Okay, don't worry, we'll call you in a minute and you'll</br> have your order ready.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And the burgers, the patties are like they heat them up, they do all</br> this to them. I've heard stories I don't like to hear about them because I</br> like the food and I don't want it to be ruined for me, but over here,</br> that's the only difference. I've stories about supposedly, if you don't get</br> along with certain people, you got to watch out what you say to certain</br> people because then they'll put stuff in your food and you end up...</br> They'll drug you or something or they'll do something just because somebody</br> else paid them to do it or stuff like that, that's why you got to be</br> careful who you mess with around areas, because it's so hard to...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Over here, everybody looks the same, really. You can't really tell</br> who's into the narcs, who's into some heavy drugs, who's into just being</br> calm, who's maybe undercover police, something like that. Over here, it's</br> like you can't really get mad at anybody on the streets, can't go off on</br> them, can't really argue with them because that person could just be</br> involved with somebody higher up or could be involved with the narcs, the</br> little gangs that there is around the areas and all right, so now you mess</br> with that person, so they already know where you work, they know you're</br> around this area all the time. They'll come and get you the next day or</br> they'll go away, come back with some friends and they'll mess with you, or</br> like they said about the food stuff or they'll come and pick you up in a</br> truck, they'll kidnap you for a while, torture you and just go and kidnap</br> you just for fun. Just to leave you in the room and not eat for a couple</br> days.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's never happened to me, but it's happened to my coworkers and</br> stuff and they've missed work one or two days and they're about to get</br> fired and they come back, and then they're like, &quot;Man, I was kidnapped. I</br> didn't have no form of communication or anything, I was kidnapped for the</br> past two days.&quot; All they ask for at work, because they know that it happens</br> and there is no way for them to prove it, really, there's no way for you to</br> prove it either so all they ask for you to do is at least go make the</br> report with the police. That way, there is at least some type of...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Record, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. That kind of follows up with your story. Like okay, at least he</br> made the report so it must be something that really happened. Well, police,</br> they won't do anything. I found that out almost a week or two after I got</br> to Mexico. A lady got robbed for her purse. There's this area that</br> everybody knows and they're like, &quot;You don't want to go in that area.&quot;</br> Because it looks beautiful and everything because the houses are all</br> different colors, they're painted all nicely and they look real nice, but</br> everybody's like, &quot;You do not want to go down there.&quot; It was like, if you</br> go in there, you're probably not going to come out or you're probably going</br> to come out, but you're going to come out without your phone, your wallet,</br> sometimes even throw you out just all naked, just for the hell of it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: That day, I saw the lady get robbed for her wallet and her purse, and</br> the guys ran into those areas. The police officers were around the corner,</br> the lady ran to them, she told them, the police came. They're like, &quot;Who is</br> it?&quot; They were looking at me. I was like, &quot;No, no. It wasn't me.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;It wasn't me, definitely not, but I saw it happen.&quot; I was like,</br> &quot;Yeah, they ran up that way. Yeah, like she said, it was two guys, blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Gave them all the information, they're like, &quot;Okay. Well, man, what</br> we're going to suggest you do is go down to the court office, or the place</br> where you make charges, and lift the charge pretty much about what</br> happened.&quot; He's like, &quot;Because right now, if we go up there into that area,</br> there could be more of them and they could also take our stuff, rob us or</br> maybe even jump us or we could go up there right now and they're probably</br> already gone inside a safe house or some friend's house. The chances of us</br> getting your stuff back right now are literally zero to none. It's not</br> worth the risk for us to go up there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, huh. I was like, you're the police, you've got guns. What's</br> the point of you getting guns and you being trained and everything if</br> you're not going to go into the areas where the people are that are doing</br> the bad stuff?</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I learned that at a young age. Well, not a young age but early point</br> in time when I got to Mexico. I quickly learned that. I saw that firsthand</br> and I was like, all right, so they're not going to help. They're not going</br> to help at all unless you physically caught the person or you know exactly</br> where that person is at, then they'll go and help you get them, if it's not</br> a area where it's known for heavy trafficking and stuff. They won't go in</br> there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Could we talk about what happened to you in the United States to make</br> you end up here?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a</br> younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had</br> anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you</br> know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for</br> some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising</br> my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my</br> family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad</br> was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the</br> moment.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was</br> always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. &quot;Look, the day that</br> I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise</br> my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues</br> going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm</br> paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still</br> AB type student.&quot; But I don't know.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,</br> that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger</br> just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was</br> a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me</br> probation for two years. When I was 12, I was supposed to be off but at a</br> year and a half, a year and eight months, they told me they were going to</br> give me a lie detector test, the polygraph test, which I was not aware of.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: About what?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going</br> to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to</br> meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a</br> year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,</br> &quot;Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just</br> going to do a polygraph test.&quot; I heard about them and I heard that some</br> people were like, &quot;Yeah, they don't really work.&quot; But I had my doubts about</br> that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.</br> If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know</br> that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an</br> advantage of people.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There</br> were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't</br> supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since</br> I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an</br> assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people</br> younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to</br> all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my</br> school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also</br> hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at</br> because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.</br> If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You were like 12?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I mean, I was there since we never had any official document,</br> the way that we worked over there would be getting a fake ID with a fake</br> name and everything. Fake ID, fake name, fake social security to work.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And to get a license?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Well, the license is a lot harder now, but I never got that at all.</br> The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the</br> car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,</br> everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I</br> at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never</br> tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's</br> something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they</br> don't have one, and they're like, &quot;You'll never want to say that you don't</br> have it. You just want to say you forgot it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, &quot;Okay, next time, make sure you</br> have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with</br> you.&quot; Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take</br> your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be</br> driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you</br> can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that</br> fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You</br> couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for</br> legal...They actually ran the social security check.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that will, obviously, since it was a fake one, it didn't pass.</br> They gave me just a number that looked legit, but it wasn't. If they ran it</br> through, it'd be like, &quot;Oh, it fell, didn't go through. Maybe the number's</br> wrong, can you double check it?&quot; And you're like, &quot;Okay, yeah, let me go</br> ahead and double check it.&quot; And you just never go to that place again</br> because you know they're going to check it, so you're just like, &quot;No, never</br> mind. Let's try another place.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie</br> detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to</br> get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, &quot;Hey, well, you</br> failed your lie detector test.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, look,</br> out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.</br> You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't</br> supposed to be doing it.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you're going to have to go before</br> the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going</br> to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and</br> then...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering</br> me five years, and I was like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It's sort of in jail.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards</br> are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Only with juveniles?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But as far as the environment goes, it's still the same. Yeah,</br> they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My</br> parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and</br> fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of</br> that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody</br> because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or</br> leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they threw me in county and I was fighting my case while I was in</br> county for about...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You're 12 or 13?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting</br> it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were</br> trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,</br> something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea</br> of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time</br> or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting</br> immigration.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: In the end, I've got a deal with the judge. They were going to extend</br> my probation for another year. We got that deal on a Friday. By the time</br> that the judge closed the deal and everything on my lawyer, it was already</br> 4:30 in the afternoon. The probation office is closed at five. They were</br> like, &quot;Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you</br> have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so</br> that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up</br> here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation</br> office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone</br> number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already</br> get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take</br> your probation and you're already registered into it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.&quot; I'm already signing the</br> paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just</br> got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend</br> I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I</br> know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it</br> seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular</br> clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.</br> Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except</br> me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm</br> like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and</br> everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like</br> immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.</br> So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way</br> you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you</br> don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, I’m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the</br> people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really</br> disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called</br> my parents and my friends were like, &quot;Hey, are you out already? Where are</br> you so we can go pick you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm inside my cell.&quot; And they're</br> like, &quot;What, why?&quot; I was like, &quot;Apparently, immigration put a hold on me</br> this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,</br> they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then</br> once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why</br> are you here still?&quot; And they were like, &quot;Oh well, it's because you have an</br> immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back</br> in.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,</br> three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were</br> trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,</br> when my judge got the deal where they were like, &quot;Okay, this is what we're</br> going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and</br> you're only going to do two years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: But you didn't do anything. You've been in jail all this time.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're like, &quot;We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of</br> a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed</br> your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your</br> probation.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile</br> for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you</br> therapy sessions for anger management.&quot; He's like, &quot;They also talk about</br> drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,</br> so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your</br> personal sessions also to help you with your issues.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And I was like, &quot;Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least</br> you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,</br> anything like that.&quot; &quot;No, no. Those options aren't available for you.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your</br> court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.&quot; Even my lawyer told</br> me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in</br> juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new</br> again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,</br> new everything was a little bit different in two years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did you go back to school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I</br> used to go. Everybody was like, &quot;Where were you last two years?&quot; Somebody</br> started a rumor I was in Canada. Some people knew where I were, because I</br> kept in contact with a couple people and they knew exactly where I were.</br> Everything went back to normal once I got back to school. Once I got off,</br> they did give me six months of probation and I didn't do anything. I was</br> doing exactly what they wanted me. From work, from house to school, from</br> school to the house. No time in between at all, no walks with anybody,</br> nothing. It was like all right, going to school, cool. Got to school,</br> school's out, okay, I'm going home. &quot;Hey, come stay, come go for an ice</br> cream.&quot; Nope. I got to go home.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just six months after that, I would probably go out with them for a</br> drink, I would go out with them for a game of basketball, football,</br> swimming, anything but just not right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: About six months past, they gave me the same probation officer as</br> before and he actually congratulated me. He's like, &quot;Hey man, you did it.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;You passed the lie detector test again.&quot; Because they gave me</br> another one before the end. &quot;You passed it, everything's good.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;I'm here to give you your paperwork that you're off.&quot; He's like, &quot;I know</br> it's three days till you're off, but we're just going to go ahead and</br> sign.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, so that way, you sign right now, you know that on</br> the eighth, you are a free man.&quot; He's like, &quot;You're good to go.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, signed my papers, everything was good and I stayed out of</br> trouble from 14 all the way till I was 19, which is when the recent charges</br> and everything came, the evading arrest and I got my shit. I didn't have no</br> reason to evade arrest, I didn't have anything on me or anything. I had had</br> one or two beers. I wasn't drunk or anything, but I did know I had kind of</br> smell, and I knew that they were going to play that on me, and I was still</br> at...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they pull you over? Were you speeding or something?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No. I wasn't speeding. They just said that it was random checks. But</br> really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a</br> couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check</br> again. I was like, &quot;Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're</br> going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have</br> my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed</br> to have alcohol at all.&quot; I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for</br> me, so I panicked, I stepped on the gas and I left.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I left and like I said, I got away because it was nighttime. I went</br> into some streets, the streets that I knew. I turned some turns and turns</br> and I lost them somewhere between. I ended up in Oklahoma, stayed over</br> there for four days at a friend’s house to try to avoid being found or</br> being captured and stuff. After four days, I was like, &quot;Okay, should be</br> calm or they should already...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I watch TV. It's like some of the TV shows, the first 48 hours, if</br> they don't find you after that, it's like they're... Yeah. But no, that's</br> definitely not that at all. I went back to my house and as soon as I got to</br> my house, I went in, I got some clothes so I can take a shower, I turned on</br> the water and as soon as I turned on the water, I started hearing knocks on</br> the door. They were like, &quot;Hey, police. We have your warrant for your</br> arrest. Either you come out or we're going to knock the door down. Blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot; So-and-so.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The house where I was living, the apartment I was living at, at that</br> point, my dad had got a house thanks to his job. So he got a nice little</br> house and he had already paid it off so it was his. He was like, &quot;Hey, I</br> can get you the apartment at a discount. It's going to be under my name, so</br> you have to take care of it.&quot; When they said all that, honestly, I thought</br> about. I was like, &quot;I could run out the back door, I could run out the</br> window and maybe escape again for a couple more days. This time I'll go for</br> a month or so.&quot; But then I was like, if they knock the door down, it's</br> going to go all back on my dad. He's been having this job for the longest</br> time. I was like, I don't want him to lose his job because of me after so</br> many years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I turned myself in. They took me back to the station, they showed</br> me the video footage of the day that they were chasing me. The dash cams</br> and everything. And they did catch a glimpse of my face when I did one</br> turn. They paused it perfectly and framed it everything, and they saw the</br> side of my face and it was perfect match and everything. I tried fighting</br> my case. I was late to court. Same late to court one time. Flight risk.</br> Even though my probation officer was there and my probation officer told</br> the judge that I was running late due to traffic. The judge was like, &quot;No,</br> he should have left the house a lot earlier. He should have left on time</br> with extra time. So we're going to put him in jail, in county.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was in county. Like I said, they took me out of my clothes and</br> everything, probation. Then they were like, &quot;No, immigration's got a hold</br> on you, so you got to go back to your cell.&quot; Went back to my cell, then</br> they transferred because they were like, &quot;Well, you're now a long-term, so</br> we're going to transfer you to this other unit that we have over here for</br> long-term people that are fighting their cases.&quot; Which was a lot worse than</br> the actual county itself.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it was a lot worse. They were like bird cages. It wasn't even</br> dorms anymore. It was just bird cages with six beds in there and it was six</br> people in there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then county was like, it's a dorm with two beds, you have your</br> toilet, you have your sink, all cool. And over here, it's a bird cage.</br> There's about six or 10 of you guys. There's about two toilets and one</br> shower, and you got to take turns and all this and that, and the sinks and</br> people get messy. Arguments with a lot of people. It was just a lot worse.</br> I was fighting my case, trying to get out on bond or get out on ankle</br> monitor or something, for about four or five months.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Finally, I gave up on that. I was like, I'll just take whatever plea</br> they gave me. They gave me the two year plea. So I took it. I was like,</br> okay. Two years again. I was like all right, here we go. But this time,</br> it's actually jail. It's not county, it's not juvenile or anything like</br> that. I thought it was going to be a lot worse than what it was, but like I</br> said, it was the same. The only people that were different were really...</br> The guys were bigger, but there was always mean guys in juvies too. The</br> only difference that I really noticed were the guards. Since you were now</br> older guys, you're adults, the guards were rough, they were mean, they were</br> just abusive.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Not abusive, really, because they never really hit you, because over</br> there, they're more strict than here with that type of stuff, but they</br> would talk really... They would talk down to you a lot and stuff like that.</br> When I did my two years there, it was depressing for me. Every time, those</br> two times that I did my time, I wasn't really depressed about me getting</br> caught up, I wasn't depressed about my situation, I was more depressed</br> about not being able to be with my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you had a daughter?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I had two daughters.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Two daughters?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first got locked up, I didn't have my daughters yet. I had my</br> first daughter when I was 15, 16. Almost right after I got out of jail, the</br> first time after my probation and everything. That's when I had my first</br> daughter. And my second daughter, I had her when I was 17. I knew her for</br> about a year, and then the year she was born, I got locked up a couple</br> months later, so I only saw her a couple times and then the rest of the</br> time I saw her through a glass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they come to see you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. My mom, she did. My daughter's mom wouldn't go, because they</br> wouldn't let her in because she wasn't immediate family. So my mom would go</br> in or my dad, and they would take my daughters in and I would talk to them.</br> Talk to them or just joke around with them, play with them there from</br> across the glass. That was my whole relationship with my second daughter.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My first daughter, I did have some encounters with her. I did have</br> some years with her there. But the important years, when she was actually</br> talking and already doing stuff, I was never there. My second daughter</br> neither. I did talk to them on the phone still, I did FaceTime to them, and</br> my daughter just cried. She wants to know when I'm going to go visit, and I</br> don't even know how to explain to her the whole situation. I just keep</br> telling them, &quot;One day, just wait. One of these days, we're going to see</br> each other. Either your mom comes over here or I go over there, but we'll</br> see each other.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you're still friendly with the mom?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. With both of them. And my family too. My family know that</br> they're my babies, that they're my blood babies and my mom, &quot;It's not their</br> fault for whatever mistakes you made. It's not their fault for whatever</br> they're going through. That's your blood, that means that's my blood,</br> they're my grandkids so I don't want to see them struggling, I don't want</br> to see them doing bad.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's always helped them out, my mom's always been there for them.</br> She's tried to help me out, I'm like, &quot;No, I'm alright right now. The day I</br> need help, don't worry, I will ask you. Don't worry, you're the only person</br> I can count on. So I know that whenever I need some help, I either got to</br> call you or my dad.&quot; I was like, &quot;But right now, just help my daughters</br> out. Since you're over there, just help them out. Either they need milk,</br> diapers, whatever it is they need, just help them out.&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm</br> doing my own thing over here, I'm helping my baby that I have over here and</br> my stepson and I'm buying clothes to send over there, and plus I'm trying</br> to make a life over here for myself also, but I also want to know that</br> they're okay over there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I left the States, when I got deported, I had my car, I had a</br> lot of furnitures, TV, everything. All of that, I gave it all to my baby's</br> mom. The newer baby. And she kept me everything. I had a nice car, had a</br> nice TV, everything, I had nice furniture. Not going to say she was the</br> best of moms at that time, but now she is. Now she's doing a lot better,</br> but at that time, she was kind of following into her mom's footsteps. Her</br> mom was kind of really into synthetic weed, which is K2, they called it</br> back then. And it would really mess with your head.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She got really into it because of her mom, and I noticed that because</br> of her mom, because she didn't used to do it, then her mom started doing it</br> in the house, and she got into it. Apparently, she sold the car, she sold a</br> lot of my stuff and...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, to get the drugs.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. To get the drugs or just to party, do whatever and she ended up</br> not doing anything. The car, she could have kept it for herself and used</br> it. She ended up buying another car later on, a couple years later, not</br> even as good of a car as the one I had. TV, she didn't even have the TV for</br> a while. At one point, to me, I thought it was karma at first. I was like,</br> I gave her a lot of stuff, I even gave her the apartment where I lived. I</br> told her that you can live in that apartment, it's under my dad's name,</br> nobody's going to charge you rent, nothing. It's a free apartment, you can</br> stay there and you can have your own place now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She didn't want none of that. And then one day, I don't know what</br> happened. Her mom fell asleep with a cigarette or something, house caught</br> on fire, everything burnt. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, but all of the</br> clothes, everything got lost. I'm like, &quot;You see? Your TV got lost, all</br> your furniture got lost, your everything, all this stuff got lost.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;You could have had all that stuff if you would have stayed at my</br> apartment. You would have had your own personal stuff, nothing like that</br> would have happened.&quot; I was like, &quot;But you took advantage of it, you took</br> it all and did I don't know what with it. I'm not going to ask you, I</br> really don't care. I gave it to you, so I'm not going to expect an</br> explanations on it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And she got mad at me because of that. She got mad because I told her</br> that stuff. I was like, &quot;Well, I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying</br> look, sometimes things happen for a reason.&quot; I was like, &quot;Everything</br> happens for a reason, I believe that.&quot; My mom didn't like that about me.</br> She didn't like the fact that I was so accepting of the things that</br> happened to me in life. She was like, &quot;You shouldn't be like just oh well,</br> everything happens for a reason or shouldn't be too upbeat about stuff.&quot;</br> Not upbeat, but yeah, upbeat. I shouldn't be taking it so good, so lightly.</br> She wanted me to take it more heavily. She's like, &quot;Hey, you're getting in</br> trouble. You're going to get deported. You should be taking it more</br> heavily, you should be upset.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, &quot;Mom, everything happens for a reason. Everything happens</br> for a reason. Every single thing is either whether you believe it or not,</br> everything happens for a reason. There is already a plan for you type</br> thing.&quot; I believe in that type of stuff and I went to church when I was</br> younger. I did go to church when I was in junior high, and it was nice. It</br> taught me a lot of stuff and I do believe in God. I'm not going to say I'm</br> a follower, but I do believe in Him and I do believe in what they believe</br> here, which is La Santa Muerte, [Saint Death] and I believe in death.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If there's one thing that everybody believes in, it's death. Because</br> everybody says, nothing is promised but death. That's one for sure thing</br> that we all have is that. Believing in the death here, believing in La</br> Santa Muerte [Saint Death] like the guys, it's a lot more credible. It's</br> like yeah, we know death is there. God, everybody says God is here, there's</br> the books and the testaments, there's no really actual evidence besides the</br> books. Yeah, there's some stuff that do... I like that type of stuff and it</br> gets my mind over, but I was never too much of a follower. My mom didn't</br> like that. She was like, &quot;You need to take it seriously.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br> am, but it's already happened. It's already done and it's already</br> happening, it's in process, what can I do about it? I can just hope for the</br> best and prepare for the worst.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, you seem to have dealt with your anger management issues.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years of therapy did help out a lot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I was going to say, you didn't get angry at this. You should be happy</br> that you didn't angry.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years that I did inside the juvie, every day was</br> therapy. It was therapy every single day, one hour of therapy every day and</br> we had at least a one hour session, a personal session twice a week. Those</br> really helped a lot. They did help a lot on my anger. At this point in</br> time, my mom doesn't like the fact that I don't get angry. She's like,</br> &quot;This stuff should make you mad. The stuff that should make you mad,</br> doesn't make you mad and the stuff that shouldn't make you mad, you get mad</br> about small stuff like...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get mad about stuff as if I was an OCD type thing. I would get mad</br> because somebody grabbed something and then leaves it over here on the</br> couch and doesn't put it back on the table. I'll get mad at stuff like</br> that. That upsets me more than, &quot;Hey, this person's talking bad about you.&quot;</br> My mom is really picky about that. My family members are really nosy.</br> They're always like, &quot;Hey, did you see what Axel published on Facebook?&quot; I</br> mean, it could be just a funny picture about a certain thing, but just</br> because I posted it, they think I'm doing those things or I'm into those</br> things. I'm like, it's just something I found funny and I wanted to share</br> with people. I'm not doing it.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's like, &quot;You know how your family is.&quot; So now it got to the</br> point where I can't even express myself on social media just because of my</br> family? I'm like, &quot;Mom, you know that I'm not doing that stuff. You talk to</br> me every day. And they're not helping me, they're not supporting me,</br> they're not doing anything for me. So why let them affect anything that has</br> to do with me?&quot; She's like, &quot;I just don't like telling me.&quot; I'm like,</br> &quot;Ignore them, block them. If they're really family, they shouldn't be doing</br> that type of stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She's like, &quot;Why are you taking it so lightly? You should be mad, you</br> should get mad that people are talking about you.&quot; I was like, &quot;Mom, at</br> this point in time, I don't really care what people say about me, because I</br> know who I am. I know who I am and what I do. If they say it, if it's true,</br> okay. I know it's true. If they say it and it's not true, okay. It's not</br> true.&quot; I don't care. Okay, go ahead, say it all you want to. I know it's</br> not true, it doesn't affect me at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get more mad at people talking about my family, talking about my</br> inner circle, my friends or anything like that. If somebody says something</br> about a family member, I'm definitely getting physical with that person or</br> if somebody says something about a friend of mine that's close by, I will</br> confront them about it. Be like, &quot;Hey, if you're going to say something</br> about them, say it when they're here, say it to their face. Don't be</br> talking about all that right now when they're not here and they can't</br> defend themselves.&quot; I'm not into that, I don't like that at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm more likely to get into a fight or into a physical altercation</br> with somebody or even verbal altercation with someone, because of them</br> saying something about somebody I care about than them saying... They could</br> say the most horrible things about me and I just brush it off my shoulders.</br> I really don't care because I know who I am. But if they anything either</br> minor or whatever it is about somebody I care about, that upsets me a lot</br> because they have no reason to say it, they don't know the person or the</br> person's not even there. So I'm like, &quot;Hey.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If the person is there, I'll be like, &quot;Hey, defend yourself, man.&quot;</br> They're like me. They're like, &quot;It's not even true, I don't really care.&quot;</br> I'm like, &quot;All right, cool. Let's just ignore them then.&quot; But I'm more</br> likely like that. My mom told me that too. She's literally learned that on.</br> She's like, &quot;Yeah, I noticed that.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a heart of gold,</br> but you let people take advantage of you and let people step over you and</br> stuff like that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I don't really care about that. I know what my</br> life is, I know what I do with my life, I know exactly where I'm going,</br> what I'm doing with my life. If people want to say all this stuff, okay.</br> They can say it. I can either let it affect me and bring me down or I can</br> let it affect me and I go at them or I go physically with them or go argue</br> with them, whatever. Or I can just let them say what they want to say and</br> act like nothing was said at all.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;It's not affecting me.&quot; If it gets to the point where</br> it's affecting me, like maybe they're talking about me and my wife or</br> talking about me doing something that is going to upset my wife and now my</br> wife is upset with me or something like that, it's causing problems in my</br> personal life, then yeah. I will get upset at that point, but if you want</br> to say, &quot;Hey, Axel's this, Axel's that, Axel did this and oh, he's this and</br> that. I heard he also was into this.&quot; All right, cool. But if you say</br> something like, &quot;Hey, did you know Axel was messing around with this girl</br> and even his wife doesn't know?&quot; And then all of a sudden my wife is like,</br> &quot;Oh, really?&quot; So now she's mad at me for something I didn't do just because</br> they said it. Okay, so now I'm going to get upset because now you're making</br> my wife, my ex, my girl, whatever it is, you're making my parents upset</br> because of that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When my mom calls me and tells me all that stuff about my family</br> members, I don't get upset at my mom. My mom's like, &quot;Hey, they're all</br> saying this and this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom, just ignore them.&quot; She's</br> like, &quot;No, how can you just ignore it?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom.&quot; I was like, &quot;Look,</br> I never hear them say anything or see them say anything. You're the one</br> that tells me. I get upset at you because you're telling me all this stuff</br> that you already know and it's upsetting me that you get upset, and it</br> upsets me that the fact that they're making you upset. I'm upset at you for</br> letting them get you upset and I'm upset at them for even worrying about</br> that stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You never worried about me when I was in the States and when I was</br> going through all that jail time. None of you wanted to help me out with a</br> recommendation card because you were like, &quot;Oh no, because if we put our</br> information on there, they're going to have us on record and they're going</br> to come looking for us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, it's nothing like that. They're not</br> even asking for your address. They just want your name and they want you to</br> write something good about me, something that you know about me. Stuff that</br> you're saying that I'm a good person to society.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, I had recommendation cards from the church where I used to go,</br> church friends, some school teachers. I had a recommendation from a lot of</br> places but my family members were never there. And that's why now that</br> they're all worried about what I'm doing over here, I'm like, come on now.</br> If I was over there and things went bad over there, where my mom was</br> actually at and where she was able to actually get to know me and punish me</br> in some way, and nothing helped over there, what makes you think that if</br> I'm doing whatever you think I'm doing over here, you telling my mom is</br> going to do anything? If it didn't work over there when I was there</br> physically, it's not going to work over the phone. Come on now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I got to the point where my Facebook, it's nothing but family members</br> and I know that I cannot put anything on there because it's nothing but my</br> family. Any other social media, I can do whatever I want but Facebook is</br> strictly family, strictly professional.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you got to watch stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, I have a last question for you. That is what are your dreams?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My dreams? I always had the same dream since I was younger. I always</br> liked what I saw between my mom and my stepdad, and I always wanted a</br> family. At this point, I got three babies with three different moms, and my</br> mom tells me, &quot;You need to stop.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just trying to have my</br> family.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a family.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, but I want</br> that family like you and my dad had.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that's always been my dream, to have my... I don't want fancy</br> stuff, I don't want to be rich, I don't want to be famous, none of that. I</br> just want to be able to have a family of my own. Be able to live with them,</br> be with them, actually see my kids grow up, see them become the young man</br> that they're going to be, the older man that they're going to be, instead</br> of just having to talk to them over the phone.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: There was a point in time, when I moved around, when I first got</br> here, moved in a place around here. That's where my family is at. I don't</br> have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over</br> there, since I had first got there, I was struggling. I didn't have a</br> phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,</br> anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a</br> year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the</br> minutes and stuff, since it was a little place, you had to go buy a card</br> with minutes to call. Once the card was over, you had to buy another card</br> or they had to pay and it wasn't good.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little</br> young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's</br> always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm</br> not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom</br> provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and</br> be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing</br> something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they</br> need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than</br> myself. Like I said, shoe brands, all that stuff don't matter to me. I want</br> to have my family, I want to be happy and make my kids happy. See my family</br> grow and see my kids grow. See what they become, because I expect them...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: People always ask me. &quot;Hey.&quot; Because I did smoke before, I did smoke</br> weed and everything but they're like, &quot;Hey, what if your kid one day did</br> something like that?&quot; I was like, the only thing I really wish, I never</br> really saw that bad. Obviously, they're legalizing it for a reason in</br> certain states.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I just wish my kids would tell me. I want them to have that</br> confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to</br> have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in</br> the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be</br> safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,</br> go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see</br> me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that</br> stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All</br> right.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but</br> at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to</br> help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be</br> able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm</br> not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's</br> why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that</br> they could say, &quot;Hey, your dad's never there.&quot; He's like, &quot;No, but he's</br> always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him</br> emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me</br> that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in</br> my life important.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my</br> wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't</br> have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from</br> here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We</br> weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just</br> felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were</br> going to grow up and be like, &quot;Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did</br> everything. He's the one that get the money.&quot; She's like, &quot;I want to feel</br> like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own</br> heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Yeah, you don't have to say that it's my part or</br> anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own</br> stuff.&quot; She's like, &quot;No, but I just still feel like it's difficult.&quot; So</br> right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix</br> things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,</br> and I understand my mom too at the same time like, &quot;Hey, you don't want to</br> go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do</br> you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you’re trying to work it out.</br>      </br>      </br> <span id="a6f9aa01-fc48-4c50-9288-4bb34b6a0f7a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family, Having Children, Falling in love">Axel: Yeah. I'm trying to work it out. My main priority is my kids. The<br>
 girl, I like her too and I love her, I still do have a lot of feelings for<br>
 her and I tell her. And I understand her situation. I know she wants to<br>
 work. She wants to feel useful and I understand that. Even here, when I'm<br>
 here and they give me vacations or anything like that, I take my vacations<br>
 and after three, four days, I'm like, &quot;All right, I'm bored, I want to go<br>
 back to work.&quot; Even though I don't like work, but my main issue, my main<br>
 priority is my kids, my family and that's my dream for me. I want to have a<br>

 for a reason. Every single thing is either whether you believe it or not,<br>
 everything happens for a reason. There is already a plan for you type<br>
 thing.&quot; I believe in that type of stuff and I went to church when I was<br>
 younger. I did go to church when I was in junior high, and it was nice. It<br>
 taught me a lot of stuff and I do believe in God. I'm not going to say I'm<br>
 a follower, but I do believe in Him and I do believe in what they believe<br>
 here, which is La Santa Muerte, [Saint Death] and I believe in death.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: If there's one thing that everybody believes in, it's death. Because<br>
 everybody says, nothing is promised but death. That's one for sure thing<br>
 that we all have is that. Believing in the death here, believing in La<br>
 Santa Muerte [Saint Death] like the guys, it's a lot more credible. It's<br>
 like yeah, we know death is there. God, everybody says God is here, there's<br>
 the books and the testaments, there's no really actual evidence besides the<br>
 books. Yeah, there's some stuff that do... I like that type of stuff and it<br>
 gets my mind over, but I was never too much of a follower. My mom didn't<br>
 like that. She was like, &quot;You need to take it seriously.&quot; I was like, &quot;I<br>
 am, but it's already happened. It's already done and it's already<br>
 happening, it's in process, what can I do about it? I can just hope for the<br>

 in or my dad, and they would take my daughters in and I would talk to them.<br>

 across the glass. That was my whole relationship with my second daughter.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: My first daughter, I did have some encounters with her. I did have<br>
 some years with her there. But the important years, when she was actually<br>
 talking and already doing stuff, I was never there. My second daughter<br>
 neither. I did talk to them on the phone still, I did FaceTime to them, and<br>
 my daughter just cried. She wants to know when I'm going to go visit, and I<br>
 don't even know how to explain to her the whole situation. I just keep<br>
 telling them, &quot;One day, just wait. One of these days, we're going to see<br>
 each other. Either your mom comes over here or I go over there, but we'll<br>
 see each other.&quot;<br>

      <br>
 Anne: So you're still friendly with the mom?<br>

 Axel: Yeah. With both of them. And my family too. My family know that<br>
 they're my babies, that they're my blood babies and my mom, &quot;It's not their<br>
 fault for whatever mistakes you made. It's not their fault for whatever<br>
 they're going through. That's your blood, that means that's my blood,<br>

 they gave me. They gave me the two year plea. So I took it. I was like,<br>
 okay. Two years again. I was like all right, here we go. But this time,<br>
 it's actually jail. It's not county, it's not juvenile or anything like<br>
 that. I thought it was going to be a lot worse than what it was, but like I<br>
 said, it was the same. The only people that were different were really...<br>
 The guys were bigger, but there was always mean guys in juvies too. The<br>
 only difference that I really noticed were the guards. Since you were now<br>
 older guys, you're adults, the guards were rough, they were mean, they were<br>
 just abusive.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Not abusive, really, because they never really hit you, because over<br>
 there, they're more strict than here with that type of stuff, but they<br>
 would talk really... They would talk down to you a lot and stuff like that.<br>
 When I did my two years there, it was depressing for me. Every time, those<br>
 two times that I did my time, I wasn't really depressed about me getting<br>
 caught up, I wasn't depressed about my situation, I was more depressed<br>
 about not being able to be with my family.<br>

 trouble from 14 all the way till I was 19, which is when the recent charges<br>
 and everything came, the evading arrest and I got my shit. I didn't have no<br>
 reason to evade arrest, I didn't have anything on me or anything. I had had<br>
 one or two beers. I wasn't drunk or anything, but I did know I had kind of<br>
 smell, and I knew that they were going to play that on me, and I was still<br>
 at...<br>

      <br>
 Anne: Did they pull you over? Were you speeding or something?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: No. I wasn't speeding. They just said that it was random checks. But<br>
 really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a<br>
 couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check<br>
 again. I was like, &quot;Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're<br>
 going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have<br>
 my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed<br>
 to have alcohol at all.&quot; I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for<br>

 you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,<br>

 like, &quot;The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your<br>
 court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.&quot; Even my lawyer told<br>
 me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in<br>

 get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take<br>
 your probation and you're already registered into it.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.&quot; I'm already signing the<br>
 paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just<br>
 got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend<br>
 I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I<br>
 know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it<br>
 seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular<br>
 clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.<br>
 Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except<br>
 me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm<br>
 like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and<br>
 everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like<br>
 immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.<br>
 So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,<br>
 &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way<br>
 you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you<br>
 don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I'm like, I’m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the<br>
 people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really<br>
 disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called<br>
 my parents and my friends were like, &quot;Hey, are you out already? Where are<br>
 you so we can go pick you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm inside my cell.&quot;</span><span id="efa27012-752c-42e6-a232-6925a20d2d66" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Arrests, Prison, Court Proceedings, Judge, Juvenile">As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie<br>
 detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to<br>
 get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, &quot;Hey, well, you<br>
 failed your lie detector test.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, look,<br>
 out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.<br>
 You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't<br>
 supposed to be doing it.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you're going to have to go before<br>
 the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going<br>
 to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and<br>
 then...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: How old were you?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering<br>
 me five years, and I was like...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: It's sort of in jail.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards<br>
 are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...<br>
      <br>

</span><span id="d949513c-bad8-45eb-aafd-219639df5ebe" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Teachers, Feelings, Frustration">Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a<br>
 younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had<br>
 anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you<br>
 know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for<br>
 some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising<br>
 my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my<br>
 family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad<br>
 was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the<br>
 moment.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was<br>
 always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. &quot;Look, the day that<br>
 I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise<br>
 my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues<br>
 going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm<br>
 paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still<br>
 AB type student.&quot; But I don't know.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,<br>
 that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger<br>
 just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was<br>
 a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me<br>
 probation for two years.</span><span id="00778cba-f64a-4a20-ac4f-05ae213f0637" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Violent crimes, Violence">Axel: Over here, everybody looks the same, really. You can't really tell<br>
 who's into the narcs, who's into some heavy drugs, who's into just being<br>
 calm, who's maybe undercover police, something like that. Over here, it's<br>
 like you can't really get mad at anybody on the streets, can't go off on<br>
 them, can't really argue with them because that person could just be<br>
 involved with somebody higher up or could be involved with the narcs, the<br>
 little gangs that there is around the areas and all right, so now you mess<br>
 with that person, so they already know where you work, they know you're<br>
 around this area all the time. They'll come and get you the next day or<br>
 they'll go away, come back with some friends and they'll mess with you, or<br>
 like they said about the food stuff or they'll come and pick you up in a<br>
 truck, they'll kidnap you for a while, torture you and just go and kidnap<br>
 you just for fun. Just to leave you in the room and not eat for a couple<br>
 days.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: It's never happened to me, but it's happened to my coworkers and<br>
 stuff and they've missed work one or two days and they're about to get<br>
 fired and they come back, and then they're like, &quot;Man, I was kidnapped. I<br>
 didn't have no form of communication or anything, I was kidnapped for the<br>
 past two days.&quot; All they ask for at work, because they know that it happens<br>
 and there is no way for them to prove it, really, there's no way for you to<br>
 prove it either so all they ask for you to do is at least go make the<br>
 report with the police.</span><span id="079185ed-5890-4a17-994d-b78f22ede372" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Cultural differences,  Food">Anne: How does it compare--the food here to US?<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: I stopped eating all that fast food. In the US, it was nothing but<br>
 Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell. Just nothing but fast food. I think the<br>
 only healthy... If you consider it healthy food that I would eat over there<br>
 would be Chinese food, Chinese restaurants. Over here, it's all mainly, not<br>
 homemade, but it's handmade. Our restaurants too, fast foods, they have<br>
 their little machines and everything but over here it's like, you go and<br>
 you buy some tacos, they're cooking it right there in front of you. They<br>
 cut it open and cook it in front of you, they do everything right there in<br>
 front of you. And in the States, you go to fast food, it's like, &quot;Okay,<br>
 I'll order this.&quot; &quot;Okay, don't worry, we'll call you in a minute and you'll<br>
 have your order ready.&quot;<br>

 little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type<br>
 of situations over there. No assaults. How do they call it? People that get<br>
 on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,<br>
 hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and<br>
 everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But<br>
 at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live<br>
 and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.<br>
 They're like, &quot;Oh yeah, that's the guy, he lives over there somewhere. I<br>
 see him every day or I see him every two days, but I seen him a couple<br>
 times.&quot;<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: But when you go to the new area, it's like...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Then you're a target.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Yeah. Everybody looks at you, everybody wants to know who you are.<br>
 Are you some type of police officer trying to do an undercover operation or<br>
 something? They either come at you because they think you look suspicious<br>
 or they come at you because you look like a easy target and you're easy to<br>
 pick for, phone or something. Either way, it's just bad all around.<br>

</span><span id="cb8ffc30-69a0-41e1-b838-90ff6c84968e" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Language, Employment">For me, I consider English my first language. It's really my<br>
 strong point. My Spanish is... Even though I spoke it at home, once I got<br>
 older, obviously I was always with my friends out playing video games,<br>
 going to basketball games, football, just doing activities, so I was never<br>
 home then. So my Spanish started going from pretty good to just like I can<br>
 get by. And now, it's getting better now, but there's certain things that I<br>
 still don't understand. That's why I found it a little bit harder when I<br>
 started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their<br>
 language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some<br>
 bigger words that I don't understand.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I<br>
 also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling<br>
 like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But<br>
 it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words<br>
 that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there<br>
 in class like, &quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?&quot;<br>

 consider bullying, my friends were just more like a teasing type thing.<br>
 Saying about the money. He's like, &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; I don't know why, he's like,<br>
 &quot;Why don't you take us out to eat?&quot; He's like, &quot;You're the one with money.&quot;<br>
 It was just funny to me. Then later on, they would have some racist jokes<br>
 in a way, but I knew that they were friends. I knew that it was just<br>
 teasing, messing around. It was never really serious.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Right, right.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Sometimes it would be like, &quot;Wow, your people don't have a lot of<br>
 money, blah, blah, blah.&quot; And then sometimes it was like, &quot;No, you don't<br>
 count. You're not even from here.&quot; It was always funny. It was never really<br>
 a serious... I never had really serious issues with school and bullying,<br>
 nothing like that. It was always pretty fun.<br>

      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: School? Actually, school really wasn't that bad. At first, it was a<br>
 little bit different, due to the language barrier, but...<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Anne: Because you hadn't learned English until then. Yeah.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into<br>
 kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and<br>
 me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my<br>
 home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.<br>
 So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my<br>
 first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and<br>
 it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff<br>
 a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more<br>
 understanding and I was getting it really quick.<br>
      <br>
      <br>
 Axel: It's like they do say, once you learn it at a early age, it's kind of<br>
 easier than learning at a older age, once you've already got this whole<br>
 other concept of what you're doing. But I mean, yeah. After that, after my<br>
 second year of school, it was actually pretty good breeze. Breeze through.<br>
 Nothing like bullying, was never really an issue, anything like that.<br>

 anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,<br>
 everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just<br>
 bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give<br>
 away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They<br>
 caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, &quot;Why do<br>
 you have two phones?&quot; Like thought I stole one. I'm like, &quot;No, I didn't.<br>
 All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.&quot;<br>
      <br>

 decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I<br>
 think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a<br>
 big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, &quot;Look, I've<br>
 got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of<br>
 your phones,&quot; He's like, &quot;And actually, the one I want is that one.&quot; He<br>
 wanted the brand new one. &quot;And actually, I want this one. So look, this is<br>
 the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,<br>
 or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that<br>
 anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go<br>
 with me.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go<br>
 ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got<br>
 with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?&quot;<br>

 decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.<br>

 and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.<br>

 They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from<br>
 you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't<br>
 offer them the money or say, &quot;I'm not going to give you any money,&quot; they'll<br>
 scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give<br>
 you a last chance. They're like, &quot;Okay, last chance before we get there,<br>
 it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or<br>
 you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br>
      <br>

 Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want<br>
 is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.<br>
 It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me<br>
 and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the<br>
 fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we<br>
 get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our<br>

 have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can<br>

 tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for<br>
 y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family<br>
 over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her<br>
 a couple times and tell her that they have me and, &quot;We have your son and<br>
 you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.&quot;<br>

 sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can<br>
 just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that<br>
 has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They<br>
 worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of<br>
 myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle<br>
 myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because<br>
 they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just<br>
 everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in<br>
 transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff<br>
 because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next<br>

He hasn't moved in 10 years, he's not going</br> to move at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And once I moved over there, he did move a block or two down, just so</br> we can go ahead and get a bigger apartment than where he was, because he</br> was just living in a single bedroom apartment for himself because he never</br> remarried after my mom. Once I moved with him, he moved about two blocks</br> down just to another apartment where it was bigger space, where I could</br> stay with him and from there, we never moved again. That's when I started</br> doing from like seventh grade, all the way up till I finished my last six</br> years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Half of it, mom was everywhere and then the other half, I was in a</br> stable location where I actually met the friends that I have now that still</br> talk to me now that I'm here and that still help me whenever they can. I</br> don't even have to ask them, they'll just tell me, &quot;Hey, right now I'm</br> going to send you some money or I'm going to do this, I'm going to give</br> your kids something, where can I meet them? Blah, blah, blah.&quot; I know that</br> they're going to help me, but I don't like to ask them because it's not</br> something that I don't really like to ask them for, for stuff because I</br> know it's not their fault that I got deported or anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Same with my family, because my mom always told me, she's like,</br> &quot;Trust me, you don't want to go to Mexico.&quot; She's like, &quot;Life over there is</br> not as you picture it. It's like your cousins and everything, they say</br> they're having fun over there, but they've been over there they're whole</br> life.&quot; He's like, &quot;You? You're going to have difficulties.&quot; One, is the</br> tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for</br> y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family</br> over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her</br> a couple times and tell her that they have me and, &quot;We have your son and</br> you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But she always have someone with her like my sister or my stepdad or</br> something, and while she's on the phone with them, then my stepdad, my</br> sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can</br> just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that</br> has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They</br> worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of</br> myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle</br> myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because</br> they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just</br> everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in</br> transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff</br> because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next</br> thing you know, you're just like, &quot;Oh, my wallet, my phone's gone.&quot; I don't</br> even know where it happened, nothing.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And authorities don't really do much to help. They almost kind of get</br> mad at you for getting robbed. They're like, &quot;We told you not to have your</br> things out in the open, we told you to check your pockets and make sure you</br> have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can</br> feel that you're getting to get them swiped out.&quot; It's not really a big</br> help. Then it comes down to that part, they're like, &quot;Well, it's gone now.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;Whoever it was, wherever they are now, it's gone.&quot; And it's</br> like, man, it's his...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And there's videos that I've seen about that stuff and it's just</br> like, it's not even just one person. It's a group of people that huddle on</br> you and it's just regular people, it's older people, it's not just young</br> people like kids and people my age, adults and people. It's also older</br> people like grandparents or just old little ladies. Couple ladies, they</br> come in and they'd be in a little group, they try asking you for</br> directions, one of them is distracting you, the other one is taking stuff</br> out of your pocket. Then she hands it off to someone else that's behind</br> them, that person walks away. Someone else comes in like a distraction</br> like, &quot;Hey, what's going on?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in it together and at the end, some people start to act</br> like they're actually caring about what's going on. In the end, they're all</br> in cahoots with it. You can't trust anybody. In the States, at least you</br> knew you could help somebody and it's probably legit. Over here, you can't</br> really trust that thing where somebody comes up to you and they're like,</br> &quot;Hey, I need some help, something's going on right here around the corner.</br> Somebody's trying to hurt my mom or somebody's trying to hurt my sister.&quot;</br> You can't even trust that because you might go around the corner and</br> they're just going to jump you and rob you. It's all just in cahoots to get</br> something out of you.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: More over here where we live, or where we work, it used to be a lot</br> calmer, but now it got to the point where they've considered it a red spot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, because they say there's too much going around the area, as far</br> as with drugs, with the robbings. People know that obviously we get some</br> decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.</br> The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we</br> get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking</br> and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.</br> It's probable cause, supposedly.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And if they catch you with something, they won't take you to jail.</br> They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from</br> you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't</br> offer them the money or say, &quot;I'm not going to give you any money,&quot; they'll</br> scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give</br> you a last chance. They're like, &quot;Okay, last chance before we get there,</br> it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or</br> you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want</br> is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.</br> It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me</br> and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the</br> fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we</br> get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our</br> attitude that we take against them.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Then it's like, all right, I had a cop one time, I didn't have</br> anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,</br> everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just</br> bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give</br> away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They</br> caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, &quot;Why do</br> you have two phones?&quot; Like thought I stole one. I'm like, &quot;No, I didn't.</br> All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The guy didn't like my whole attitude that I had with them, so he</br> decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I</br> think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a</br> big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, &quot;Look, I've</br> got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of</br> your phones,&quot; He's like, &quot;And actually, the one I want is that one.&quot; He</br> wanted the brand new one. &quot;And actually, I want this one. So look, this is</br> the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,</br> or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that</br> anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go</br> with me.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go</br> ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got</br> with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Obviously, I'm not going to risk it. I didn't believe him at the same</br> time, but since they do always take money and any other types of bribes, so</br> I'm like, I'm not going to risk it, try to play the brave guy and be like,</br> &quot;All right, go ahead and take me,&quot; and stuff, and then they do it, and then</br> I'm going to be like, &quot;Oh no, never mind.&quot; They might even end up taking</br> both of my phones or anything like that. I have friends that because they</br> said no and they refused to give the phone, they put it inside their pants</br> so the cops couldn't get it, they ended up beating them up. They would just</br> grab them and beat them and, &quot;All right, there you go. You can go on about</br> your merry way. We didn't get nothing from you, but we at least gave you a</br> beating. Maybe you'll learn.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This area right here is not really good for us, especially at</br> nighttime. And any cops that see us, any cops or anything like that,</br> they're going to try to pull us over and find something. If they don't find</br> something or if they already know you and they don't like you, because they</br> recognize. Me, they come up to me and they almost know my name already.</br> They're like, &quot;Hey, so what's going on?&quot; He's like, &quot;Are you clean today</br> too?&quot; He's like, &quot;Yeah, like every other time. Yeah.&quot; It's like, I work</br> here. You do this every day, every day you don't get anything from me. What</br> makes you think that today's going to be different? Obviously, I know that</br> I'm not going to... That this area is not the area to be doing anything. If</br> I want to do anything at all, I'm not going to do it here at work or</br> outside of work.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's annoying sometimes, because sometimes even because of that,</br> within the two blocks, they could search you about two, maybe three times.</br> Because one guy will search you on the bikes, the guys on the bikes, then</br> you're okay, they'll search you, they'll let you go. About another block</br> later, you'll bump into guys that are just walking around and they'll</br> search you too. Another block later, the guys in the cars, the trucks are</br> going by, they'll stop in front. &quot;Hey, let me do a quick search, just</br> random.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Random.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Random?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You can be late to work just because of that. You could be 10 minutes</br> early or two minutes early, but if you get stopped twice right here at</br> least, you lost all your time right there. You're running late already to</br> work. That's either before work, during lunch, on a break, after work when</br> you're going home. It's just anytime. It got to the point where work, it's</br> a mission just to go from your work to where your transport is. Either the</br> train line, the substation or the buses. They're only about three...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The train stations are three blocks away, the bus is maybe two blocks</br> away, and within that little range, it's probably the biggest mission ever.</br> People talk about the areas where they have all the drugs, they beat them</br> or places like that where it's supposedly heavy, and really, I've gone to</br> those areas because I have friends and people that live in those areas and</br> I've gone to visit them, and the cops are there in that area, they're right</br> outside of the locations where they're selling stuff. They can smell the</br> stuff, they can see people going in and out of the place, but they don't go</br> in the place. They do checks on everybody that comes out of there, to try</br> to see if maybe they can catch them slipping up and get some money off of</br> them, a phone, whatever they can, but they will never go inside of the</br> location where they see everybody going in and out of.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's either because they're already being paid by them or it's</br> because they know that if they go in there, it's going to be some big drama</br> with the guys in there, or it's just that they don't really care anybody</br> that. They just want to make something for their day. Here, it's almost</br> just like that. There's cops everywhere, they stop you for anything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah. Wow. So let's go back to the US. You're with your mom, and is</br> she working? Did she start working when you guys moved?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. When we first moved, yeah. She was working in a restaurant, in</br> a mall, actually. She was working inside a restaurant in the mall.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And your dad?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And my dad was doing maintenance work at the apartments where we</br> lived.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, nice.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: We were getting, the apartment where we lived, we were getting a good</br> discount and then my mom was working a night shift or... no, wait. She was</br> doing morning shift in the mall. My dad and my mom would get off around the</br> same time. That was never really an issue with them. But once she got</br> divorced and she got with my stepdad, she stopped working. She just focused</br> more on with me, she got pregnant and started having my sister, and after</br> that, she just focused more on being a housewife. Being a housewife, being</br> a house mom.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She did great. She kept herself real busy and she always worried a</br> lot about us, tried to give us everything we needed for school, for food,</br> dress wise. Anything we needed. She did what she could with what my stepdad</br> would provide her.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he also from Mexico?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. He was from Mexico.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Was he a citizen or was he undocumented?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No, he was also undocumented. He's still undocumented to the point.</br> He was working with my dad. They were coworkers.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, that's what you were saying. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then I don't know the whole story of how my mom and my stepdad</br> started talking, but I know they were coworkers because they've told me</br> that part before, and my dad's also told me. He's like, &quot;Yeah, I know him.</br> We used to work together, he was just my partner, in a way.&quot; I mean, my dad</br> doesn't seem like he has any hard feelings about it, but he never remarried</br> again, so I don't know what happened there. But my mom got remarried and</br> now it's been like, I don't know, I suppose right now it's been about</br> almost 20 years? And he's never remarried, he's never really bothered, I’ve</br> never met him to have a girlfriend, no other kids, nothing. After the first</br> one, he just gave up and just enjoys his house alone with the dogs and</br> stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How was school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: School? Actually, school really wasn't that bad. At first, it was a</br> little bit different, due to the language barrier, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you hadn't learned English until then. Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into</br> kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and</br> me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my</br> home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.</br> So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my</br> first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and</br> it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff</br> a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more</br> understanding and I was getting it really quick.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's like they do say, once you learn it at a early age, it's kind of</br> easier than learning at a older age, once you've already got this whole</br> other concept of what you're doing. But I mean, yeah. After that, after my</br> second year of school, it was actually pretty good breeze. Breeze through.</br> Nothing like bullying, was never really an issue, anything like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You had lots of friends?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Yeah, yeah. Because of the same reasons, like I said, my mom</br> liked to move a lot, I had friends everywhere and I had certain people that</br> obviously do make some type of connection with, and you maybe stay in</br> contact with those more than anybody else or you stay in contact with that</br> person and nobody else out of the whole school or whatever. So I had</br> friends everywhere in different areas and later on, when I moved with my</br> dad, I actually bumped into one of my older friends from fourth, fifth</br> grade. I bumped into him in eighth grade and I didn't recognize him, he</br> recognized me and he was like, &quot;Yeah, I remember you. We were in this class</br> together.&quot; And he started telling me, &quot;Oh my god, I remember.&quot; And I was</br> like, what a coincidence. I was two cities away, an hour away, and now</br> you're here. We're back in the same school together.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: He started presenting me to some other friends, and obviously, there</br> was always Hispanics and there was always what they call the Chicanos, the</br> ones that were born over there but have their parents move here. That's</br> what my sisters and my brothers are considered, and they're always real</br> friendly. The racism and stuff, in areas where I lived, it never really was</br> an issue. I know I order heard about some areas where I have family members</br> that live in maybe Louisiana and Wisconsin and stuff like that, yeah, no,</br> they see a little bit more but it was never that issue where I was at.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was more, I lived in a kind of rough area, but I went to school in</br> the nice, high class schools and stuff, with people from rich neighborhoods</br> and people got to the point where they thought that my family was living</br> all right, because they had two vehicles. But it wasn't really anything</br> like that, it was just that my dad had his work truck that he used for all</br> his equipment and everything that he needed, and then he had his car that</br> was just for whenever he went somewhere to just store or just to have some</br> fun, it's not as much gas. Since he was still working with the same</br> apartment company that he's been working with, the apartment that he was</br> getting, he was now getting it for free. He didn't have to pay any rent or</br> water, nothing like that, everything was free.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So that helped a lot. It made it look like we were having a lot more</br> money than what we actually had, just because we were avoiding the rent.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. And everybody thought that but I was like, &quot;No, not really.&quot;</br> I've never been really the flashy type stuff. Everybody wanted the</br> Jordan's, all this stuff, nice. No, not me. I just wanted something... As</br> long as it looked nice and I liked the way it looked, I would buy it,</br> whether it was at a market for garage sale or was it Ross or Walmart. I</br> really didn't care much about the brands, as long as I liked it and I liked</br> the way it looks on me.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But I always found that funny that people thought that my parents had</br> more than what they actually had. I'm like, no, it's not bad, it's just</br> that my mom knows how to manage the money that my stepdad gives her and my</br> dad, he doesn't have anybody else but himself and he doesn't pay any rent</br> or anything like that. He's not wasting his money on stupid stuff either.</br> He likes to go out a lot so he goes on vacations a lot. Since he's been</br> with the company, they give a lot of vacations. He goes out, goes out of</br> the state, visits a lot of places and stuff like that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It was just really fun. That was the only thing that I wouldn't</br> consider bullying, my friends were just more like a teasing type thing.</br> Saying about the money. He's like, &quot;Oh yeah.&quot; I don't know why, he's like,</br> &quot;Why don't you take us out to eat?&quot; He's like, &quot;You're the one with money.&quot;</br> It was just funny to me. Then later on, they would have some racist jokes</br> in a way, but I knew that they were friends. I knew that it was just</br> teasing, messing around. It was never really serious.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Right, right.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Sometimes it would be like, &quot;Wow, your people don't have a lot of</br> money, blah, blah, blah.&quot; And then sometimes it was like, &quot;No, you don't</br> count. You're not even from here.&quot; It was always funny. It was never really</br> a serious... I never had really serious issues with school and bullying,</br> nothing like that. It was always pretty fun.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's great.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And over here, when I started school, it was a little bit different.</br> People do look at you different, everybody wants to ask you questions about</br> over there, ask you how to say stuff. I'm not bothered by it, but it does</br> get kind of annoying at some point. Everybody at all times, for every</br> single thing. It's just like, everybody, at all times, for every single</br> thing, and like people here go to school and they have English homework, I</br> don't mind doing that, but then when we go somewhere and they're hanging</br> out and every other thing, they're like, &quot;Hey, what is that? Or how you say</br> this or how do you do that or how do you say that or what does that mean or</br> what does this...&quot; It's like all right, I can't really do what I want to do</br> because I got to go over here and translate everything else or tell you how</br> to say all this other stuff just because. I don't mind, but it's like to a</br> certain extent, at some point, I do want to think about doing my career for</br> English. Pretty much being a teacher.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Be an English teacher?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I have the language and I just need to take the classes for</br> them to show me how to show somebody else.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But at the same time, I don't know, man. I don't want to have to</br> explain to people stuff about how to say stuff. It's kind of hard for me to</br> explain it, because it was just something that I was taught. I learned just</br> like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Because you were a kid.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. For me, I consider English my first language. It's really my</br> strong point. My Spanish is... Even though I spoke it at home, once I got</br> older, obviously I was always with my friends out playing video games,</br> going to basketball games, football, just doing activities, so I was never</br> home then. So my Spanish started going from pretty good to just like I can</br> get by. And now, it's getting better now, but there's certain things that I</br> still don't understand. That's why I found it a little bit harder when I</br> started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their</br> language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some</br> bigger words that I don't understand.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I</br> also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling</br> like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But</br> it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words</br> that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there</br> in class like, &quot;Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So now he has to explain all the thing over again in simple words or</br> baby terms for me so I can understand it. It's just like... Besides that, I</br> found that kind of hard but I would never leave school because of that. I</br> was willing to struggle with it but like I said, once I had my baby and</br> everything here, then everything just... I had to put all that aside so I</br> could focus on the money because the job that I had at that point wasn't</br> all that much, and obviously, a baby is a big...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Expense, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it's a big expense and the girl I got with, my ex-wife, she</br> already had a baby. I had a stepson and then I was going to have my son,</br> and also to buy stuff here and send it over there for my daughter. I don't</br> send them money because I know the money that I could send a whole paycheck</br> from that I get right now, and it would be like maybe $100 or $150 for</br> them, almost nothing. So I know that instead of doing that, I know I could</br> buy some stuff here. Toys, shoes, clothes and I could send to them, my</br> parents will cover the fee of paying the shipping and I know it will help</br> them a lot more than me sending them $100 or something like that, and it</br> would affect me a lot more here.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: A lot more, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And it wouldn't affect them at all over there. I got that boundary</br> right there. It's different. It's a lot different. It took me almost the</br> whole year and a half or two to get used it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Get used to it, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But no, still, there's still some things that I have to learn</br> or that somebody shows me and I'm just like, &quot;Oh, all right.&quot; I've met some</br> people that are actually from here and they've learned English here, in the</br> school, and they're actually pretty good at it and they told me about their</br> life here and they're the ones that show me around or explain to me some</br> type of legal stuff or not legal stuff or maybe how stuff works around</br> here. I still learn a lot of stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: This city, I know the area where I live, I know my area around here</br> where I work, and I know maybe one or two areas where some friends live, my</br> main friends, and that's it. I cannot get around. I know how to use the</br> stations for the trains, but don't tell me, &quot;Hey, come meet me over here in</br> so-and-so place or in this city or in this community.&quot; Because I'm not</br> going to. I'm not going to know. Tell me a station, I'll probably go to the</br> station and then from there, just meet me there because I'm not going to</br> get lost and I don't really trust the areas.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You could tell me it's all calm, but everybody says my area is a</br> little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type</br> of situations over there. No assaults. How do they call it? People that get</br> on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,</br> hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and</br> everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But</br> at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live</br> and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.</br> They're like, &quot;Oh yeah, that's the guy, he lives over there somewhere. I</br> see him every day or I see him every two days, but I seen him a couple</br> times.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: But when you go to the new area, it's like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Then you're a target.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Everybody looks at you, everybody wants to know who you are.</br> Are you some type of police officer trying to do an undercover operation or</br> something? They either come at you because they think you look suspicious</br> or they come at you because you look like a easy target and you're easy to</br> pick for, phone or something. Either way, it's just bad all around.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Or even the cops, they look at you and they see you looking around</br> too much like you don't know what you're doing, they come at you like,</br> &quot;Hey, what are you doing here? Who are you looking for? Are you trying to</br> connect stuff, are you trying to find somebody with some type of substance</br> or something?&quot; Like no, I'm just trying to find the street here. I don't</br> know where I'm at. Most of these streets don't even have names. They're</br> covered or they're blocked by little taco stands. That's not bad.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Something I like here is that there's food everywhere. There's stands</br> everywhere for everything.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How does it compare--the food here to US?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I stopped eating all that fast food. In the US, it was nothing but</br> Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell. Just nothing but fast food. I think the</br> only healthy... If you consider it healthy food that I would eat over there</br> would be Chinese food, Chinese restaurants. Over here, it's all mainly, not</br> homemade, but it's handmade. Our restaurants too, fast foods, they have</br> their little machines and everything but over here it's like, you go and</br> you buy some tacos, they're cooking it right there in front of you. They</br> cut it open and cook it in front of you, they do everything right there in</br> front of you. And in the States, you go to fast food, it's like, &quot;Okay,</br> I'll order this.&quot; &quot;Okay, don't worry, we'll call you in a minute and you'll</br> have your order ready.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And the burgers, the patties are like they heat them up, they do all</br> this to them. I've heard stories I don't like to hear about them because I</br> like the food and I don't want it to be ruined for me, but over here,</br> that's the only difference. I've stories about supposedly, if you don't get</br> along with certain people, you got to watch out what you say to certain</br> people because then they'll put stuff in your food and you end up...</br> They'll drug you or something or they'll do something just because somebody</br> else paid them to do it or stuff like that, that's why you got to be</br> careful who you mess with around areas, because it's so hard to...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Over here, everybody looks the same, really. You can't really tell</br> who's into the narcs, who's into some heavy drugs, who's into just being</br> calm, who's maybe undercover police, something like that. Over here, it's</br> like you can't really get mad at anybody on the streets, can't go off on</br> them, can't really argue with them because that person could just be</br> involved with somebody higher up or could be involved with the narcs, the</br> little gangs that there is around the areas and all right, so now you mess</br> with that person, so they already know where you work, they know you're</br> around this area all the time. They'll come and get you the next day or</br> they'll go away, come back with some friends and they'll mess with you, or</br> like they said about the food stuff or they'll come and pick you up in a</br> truck, they'll kidnap you for a while, torture you and just go and kidnap</br> you just for fun. Just to leave you in the room and not eat for a couple</br> days.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: It's never happened to me, but it's happened to my coworkers and</br> stuff and they've missed work one or two days and they're about to get</br> fired and they come back, and then they're like, &quot;Man, I was kidnapped. I</br> didn't have no form of communication or anything, I was kidnapped for the</br> past two days.&quot; All they ask for at work, because they know that it happens</br> and there is no way for them to prove it, really, there's no way for you to</br> prove it either so all they ask for you to do is at least go make the</br> report with the police. That way, there is at least some type of...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Record, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. That kind of follows up with your story. Like okay, at least he</br> made the report so it must be something that really happened. Well, police,</br> they won't do anything. I found that out almost a week or two after I got</br> to Mexico. A lady got robbed for her purse. There's this area that</br> everybody knows and they're like, &quot;You don't want to go in that area.&quot;</br> Because it looks beautiful and everything because the houses are all</br> different colors, they're painted all nicely and they look real nice, but</br> everybody's like, &quot;You do not want to go down there.&quot; It was like, if you</br> go in there, you're probably not going to come out or you're probably going</br> to come out, but you're going to come out without your phone, your wallet,</br> sometimes even throw you out just all naked, just for the hell of it.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: That day, I saw the lady get robbed for her wallet and her purse, and</br> the guys ran into those areas. The police officers were around the corner,</br> the lady ran to them, she told them, the police came. They're like, &quot;Who is</br> it?&quot; They were looking at me. I was like, &quot;No, no. It wasn't me.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;It wasn't me, definitely not, but I saw it happen.&quot; I was like,</br> &quot;Yeah, they ran up that way. Yeah, like she said, it was two guys, blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Gave them all the information, they're like, &quot;Okay. Well, man, what</br> we're going to suggest you do is go down to the court office, or the place</br> where you make charges, and lift the charge pretty much about what</br> happened.&quot; He's like, &quot;Because right now, if we go up there into that area,</br> there could be more of them and they could also take our stuff, rob us or</br> maybe even jump us or we could go up there right now and they're probably</br> already gone inside a safe house or some friend's house. The chances of us</br> getting your stuff back right now are literally zero to none. It's not</br> worth the risk for us to go up there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, huh. I was like, you're the police, you've got guns. What's</br> the point of you getting guns and you being trained and everything if</br> you're not going to go into the areas where the people are that are doing</br> the bad stuff?</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's crazy.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I learned that at a young age. Well, not a young age but early point</br> in time when I got to Mexico. I quickly learned that. I saw that firsthand</br> and I was like, all right, so they're not going to help. They're not going</br> to help at all unless you physically caught the person or you know exactly</br> where that person is at, then they'll go and help you get them, if it's not</br> a area where it's known for heavy trafficking and stuff. They won't go in</br> there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Could we talk about what happened to you in the United States to make</br> you end up here?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a</br> younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had</br> anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you</br> know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for</br> some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising</br> my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my</br> family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad</br> was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the</br> moment.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was</br> always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. &quot;Look, the day that</br> I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise</br> my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues</br> going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm</br> paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still</br> AB type student.&quot; But I don't know.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,</br> that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger</br> just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was</br> a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me</br> probation for two years. When I was 12, I was supposed to be off but at a</br> year and a half, a year and eight months, they told me they were going to</br> give me a lie detector test, the polygraph test, which I was not aware of.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: About what?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going</br> to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to</br> meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a</br> year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,</br> &quot;Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just</br> going to do a polygraph test.&quot; I heard about them and I heard that some</br> people were like, &quot;Yeah, they don't really work.&quot; But I had my doubts about</br> that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.</br> If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know</br> that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an</br> advantage of people.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There</br> were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't</br> supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since</br> I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an</br> assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people</br> younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to</br> all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my</br> school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also</br> hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at</br> because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.</br> If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You were like 12?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I mean, I was there since we never had any official document,</br> the way that we worked over there would be getting a fake ID with a fake</br> name and everything. Fake ID, fake name, fake social security to work.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And to get a license?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Well, the license is a lot harder now, but I never got that at all.</br> The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the</br> car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,</br> everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I</br> at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never</br> tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's</br> something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they</br> don't have one, and they're like, &quot;You'll never want to say that you don't</br> have it. You just want to say you forgot it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, &quot;Okay, next time, make sure you</br> have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with</br> you.&quot; Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take</br> your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be</br> driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you</br> can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that</br> fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You</br> couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for</br> legal...They actually ran the social security check.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh yeah, yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that will, obviously, since it was a fake one, it didn't pass.</br> They gave me just a number that looked legit, but it wasn't. If they ran it</br> through, it'd be like, &quot;Oh, it fell, didn't go through. Maybe the number's</br> wrong, can you double check it?&quot; And you're like, &quot;Okay, yeah, let me go</br> ahead and double check it.&quot; And you just never go to that place again</br> because you know they're going to check it, so you're just like, &quot;No, never</br> mind. Let's try another place.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie</br> detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to</br> get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, &quot;Hey, well, you</br> failed your lie detector test.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, look,</br> out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.</br> You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't</br> supposed to be doing it.&quot; He's like, &quot;So you're going to have to go before</br> the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going</br> to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and</br> then...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: How old were you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering</br> me five years, and I was like...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: It's sort of in jail.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards</br> are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Only with juveniles?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. But as far as the environment goes, it's still the same. Yeah,</br> they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My</br> parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and</br> fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of</br> that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody</br> because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or</br> leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So they threw me in county and I was fighting my case while I was in</br> county for about...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: You're 12 or 13?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting</br> it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were</br> trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,</br> something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea</br> of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time</br> or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting</br> immigration.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: In the end, I've got a deal with the judge. They were going to extend</br> my probation for another year. We got that deal on a Friday. By the time</br> that the judge closed the deal and everything on my lawyer, it was already</br> 4:30 in the afternoon. The probation office is closed at five. They were</br> like, &quot;Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you</br> have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so</br> that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up</br> here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation</br> office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone</br> number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already</br> get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take</br> your probation and you're already registered into it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.&quot; I'm already signing the</br> paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just</br> got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend</br> I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I</br> know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it</br> seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular</br> clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.</br> Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except</br> me. And they asked me, she's like, &quot;Hey, what are you waiting for?&quot; I'm</br> like, &quot;I'm waiting for a probation officer too.&quot; So I looked up my name and</br> everything and they were like, &quot;Oh, well, actually, it looks like</br> immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.</br> So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way</br> you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you</br> don't have to meet some new people and stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, I’m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the</br> people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really</br> disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called</br> my parents and my friends were like, &quot;Hey, are you out already? Where are</br> you so we can go pick you up?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm inside my cell.&quot; And they're</br> like, &quot;What, why?&quot; I was like, &quot;Apparently, immigration put a hold on me</br> this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,</br> they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then</br> once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why</br> are you here still?&quot; And they were like, &quot;Oh well, it's because you have an</br> immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back</br> in.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,</br> three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were</br> trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,</br> when my judge got the deal where they were like, &quot;Okay, this is what we're</br> going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and</br> you're only going to do two years.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: But you didn't do anything. You've been in jail all this time.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. They're like, &quot;We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of</br> a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed</br> your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your</br> probation.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile</br> for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you</br> therapy sessions for anger management.&quot; He's like, &quot;They also talk about</br> drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,</br> so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your</br> personal sessions also to help you with your issues.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And I was like, &quot;Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least</br> you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,</br> anything like that.&quot; &quot;No, no. Those options aren't available for you.&quot; He's</br> like, &quot;The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your</br> court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.&quot; Even my lawyer told</br> me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in</br> juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new</br> again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,</br> new everything was a little bit different in two years.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did you go back to school?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I</br> used to go. Everybody was like, &quot;Where were you last two years?&quot; Somebody</br> started a rumor I was in Canada. Some people knew where I were, because I</br> kept in contact with a couple people and they knew exactly where I were.</br> Everything went back to normal once I got back to school. Once I got off,</br> they did give me six months of probation and I didn't do anything. I was</br> doing exactly what they wanted me. From work, from house to school, from</br> school to the house. No time in between at all, no walks with anybody,</br> nothing. It was like all right, going to school, cool. Got to school,</br> school's out, okay, I'm going home. &quot;Hey, come stay, come go for an ice</br> cream.&quot; Nope. I got to go home.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Just six months after that, I would probably go out with them for a</br> drink, I would go out with them for a game of basketball, football,</br> swimming, anything but just not right now.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: About six months past, they gave me the same probation officer as</br> before and he actually congratulated me. He's like, &quot;Hey man, you did it.&quot;</br> He's like, &quot;You passed the lie detector test again.&quot; Because they gave me</br> another one before the end. &quot;You passed it, everything's good.&quot; He's like,</br> &quot;I'm here to give you your paperwork that you're off.&quot; He's like, &quot;I know</br> it's three days till you're off, but we're just going to go ahead and</br> sign.&quot; He's like, &quot;Look, so that way, you sign right now, you know that on</br> the eighth, you are a free man.&quot; He's like, &quot;You're good to go.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, signed my papers, everything was good and I stayed out of</br> trouble from 14 all the way till I was 19, which is when the recent charges</br> and everything came, the evading arrest and I got my shit. I didn't have no</br> reason to evade arrest, I didn't have anything on me or anything. I had had</br> one or two beers. I wasn't drunk or anything, but I did know I had kind of</br> smell, and I knew that they were going to play that on me, and I was still</br> at...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they pull you over? Were you speeding or something?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: No. I wasn't speeding. They just said that it was random checks. But</br> really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a</br> couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check</br> again. I was like, &quot;Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're</br> going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have</br> my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed</br> to have alcohol at all.&quot; I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for</br> me, so I panicked, I stepped on the gas and I left.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I left and like I said, I got away because it was nighttime. I went</br> into some streets, the streets that I knew. I turned some turns and turns</br> and I lost them somewhere between. I ended up in Oklahoma, stayed over</br> there for four days at a friend’s house to try to avoid being found or</br> being captured and stuff. After four days, I was like, &quot;Okay, should be</br> calm or they should already...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I watch TV. It's like some of the TV shows, the first 48 hours, if</br> they don't find you after that, it's like they're... Yeah. But no, that's</br> definitely not that at all. I went back to my house and as soon as I got to</br> my house, I went in, I got some clothes so I can take a shower, I turned on</br> the water and as soon as I turned on the water, I started hearing knocks on</br> the door. They were like, &quot;Hey, police. We have your warrant for your</br> arrest. Either you come out or we're going to knock the door down. Blah,</br> blah, blah.&quot; So-and-so.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: The house where I was living, the apartment I was living at, at that</br> point, my dad had got a house thanks to his job. So he got a nice little</br> house and he had already paid it off so it was his. He was like, &quot;Hey, I</br> can get you the apartment at a discount. It's going to be under my name, so</br> you have to take care of it.&quot; When they said all that, honestly, I thought</br> about. I was like, &quot;I could run out the back door, I could run out the</br> window and maybe escape again for a couple more days. This time I'll go for</br> a month or so.&quot; But then I was like, if they knock the door down, it's</br> going to go all back on my dad. He's been having this job for the longest</br> time. I was like, I don't want him to lose his job because of me after so</br> many years.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: So I turned myself in. They took me back to the station, they showed</br> me the video footage of the day that they were chasing me. The dash cams</br> and everything. And they did catch a glimpse of my face when I did one</br> turn. They paused it perfectly and framed it everything, and they saw the</br> side of my face and it was perfect match and everything. I tried fighting</br> my case. I was late to court. Same late to court one time. Flight risk.</br> Even though my probation officer was there and my probation officer told</br> the judge that I was running late due to traffic. The judge was like, &quot;No,</br> he should have left the house a lot earlier. He should have left on time</br> with extra time. So we're going to put him in jail, in county.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was in county. Like I said, they took me out of my clothes and</br> everything, probation. Then they were like, &quot;No, immigration's got a hold</br> on you, so you got to go back to your cell.&quot; Went back to my cell, then</br> they transferred because they were like, &quot;Well, you're now a long-term, so</br> we're going to transfer you to this other unit that we have over here for</br> long-term people that are fighting their cases.&quot; Which was a lot worse than</br> the actual county itself.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, really?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, it was a lot worse. They were like bird cages. It wasn't even</br> dorms anymore. It was just bird cages with six beds in there and it was six</br> people in there.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, wow.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And then county was like, it's a dorm with two beds, you have your</br> toilet, you have your sink, all cool. And over here, it's a bird cage.</br> There's about six or 10 of you guys. There's about two toilets and one</br> shower, and you got to take turns and all this and that, and the sinks and</br> people get messy. Arguments with a lot of people. It was just a lot worse.</br> I was fighting my case, trying to get out on bond or get out on ankle</br> monitor or something, for about four or five months.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Finally, I gave up on that. I was like, I'll just take whatever plea</br> they gave me. They gave me the two year plea. So I took it. I was like,</br> okay. Two years again. I was like all right, here we go. But this time,</br> it's actually jail. It's not county, it's not juvenile or anything like</br> that. I thought it was going to be a lot worse than what it was, but like I</br> said, it was the same. The only people that were different were really...</br> The guys were bigger, but there was always mean guys in juvies too. The</br> only difference that I really noticed were the guards. Since you were now</br> older guys, you're adults, the guards were rough, they were mean, they were</br> just abusive.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Not abusive, really, because they never really hit you, because over</br> there, they're more strict than here with that type of stuff, but they</br> would talk really... They would talk down to you a lot and stuff like that.</br> When I did my two years there, it was depressing for me. Every time, those</br> two times that I did my time, I wasn't really depressed about me getting</br> caught up, I wasn't depressed about my situation, I was more depressed</br> about not being able to be with my family.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: And you had a daughter?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I had two daughters.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Two daughters?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I first got locked up, I didn't have my daughters yet. I had my</br> first daughter when I was 15, 16. Almost right after I got out of jail, the</br> first time after my probation and everything. That's when I had my first</br> daughter. And my second daughter, I had her when I was 17. I knew her for</br> about a year, and then the year she was born, I got locked up a couple</br> months later, so I only saw her a couple times and then the rest of the</br> time I saw her through a glass.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Did they come to see you?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. My mom, she did. My daughter's mom wouldn't go, because they</br> wouldn't let her in because she wasn't immediate family. So my mom would go</br> in or my dad, and they would take my daughters in and I would talk to them.</br> Talk to them or just joke around with them, play with them there from</br> across the glass. That was my whole relationship with my second daughter.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My first daughter, I did have some encounters with her. I did have</br> some years with her there. But the important years, when she was actually</br> talking and already doing stuff, I was never there. My second daughter</br> neither. I did talk to them on the phone still, I did FaceTime to them, and</br> my daughter just cried. She wants to know when I'm going to go visit, and I</br> don't even know how to explain to her the whole situation. I just keep</br> telling them, &quot;One day, just wait. One of these days, we're going to see</br> each other. Either your mom comes over here or I go over there, but we'll</br> see each other.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you're still friendly with the mom?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. With both of them. And my family too. My family know that</br> they're my babies, that they're my blood babies and my mom, &quot;It's not their</br> fault for whatever mistakes you made. It's not their fault for whatever</br> they're going through. That's your blood, that means that's my blood,</br> they're my grandkids so I don't want to see them struggling, I don't want</br> to see them doing bad.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's always helped them out, my mom's always been there for them.</br> She's tried to help me out, I'm like, &quot;No, I'm alright right now. The day I</br> need help, don't worry, I will ask you. Don't worry, you're the only person</br> I can count on. So I know that whenever I need some help, I either got to</br> call you or my dad.&quot; I was like, &quot;But right now, just help my daughters</br> out. Since you're over there, just help them out. Either they need milk,</br> diapers, whatever it is they need, just help them out.&quot; I was like, &quot;I'm</br> doing my own thing over here, I'm helping my baby that I have over here and</br> my stepson and I'm buying clothes to send over there, and plus I'm trying</br> to make a life over here for myself also, but I also want to know that</br> they're okay over there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When I left the States, when I got deported, I had my car, I had a</br> lot of furnitures, TV, everything. All of that, I gave it all to my baby's</br> mom. The newer baby. And she kept me everything. I had a nice car, had a</br> nice TV, everything, I had nice furniture. Not going to say she was the</br> best of moms at that time, but now she is. Now she's doing a lot better,</br> but at that time, she was kind of following into her mom's footsteps. Her</br> mom was kind of really into synthetic weed, which is K2, they called it</br> back then. And it would really mess with your head.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She got really into it because of her mom, and I noticed that because</br> of her mom, because she didn't used to do it, then her mom started doing it</br> in the house, and she got into it. Apparently, she sold the car, she sold a</br> lot of my stuff and...</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Oh, to get the drugs.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. To get the drugs or just to party, do whatever and she ended up</br> not doing anything. The car, she could have kept it for herself and used</br> it. She ended up buying another car later on, a couple years later, not</br> even as good of a car as the one I had. TV, she didn't even have the TV for</br> a while. At one point, to me, I thought it was karma at first. I was like,</br> I gave her a lot of stuff, I even gave her the apartment where I lived. I</br> told her that you can live in that apartment, it's under my dad's name,</br> nobody's going to charge you rent, nothing. It's a free apartment, you can</br> stay there and you can have your own place now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She didn't want none of that. And then one day, I don't know what</br> happened. Her mom fell asleep with a cigarette or something, house caught</br> on fire, everything burnt. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, but all of the</br> clothes, everything got lost. I'm like, &quot;You see? Your TV got lost, all</br> your furniture got lost, your everything, all this stuff got lost.&quot; I was</br> like, &quot;You could have had all that stuff if you would have stayed at my</br> apartment. You would have had your own personal stuff, nothing like that</br> would have happened.&quot; I was like, &quot;But you took advantage of it, you took</br> it all and did I don't know what with it. I'm not going to ask you, I</br> really don't care. I gave it to you, so I'm not going to expect an</br> explanations on it.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And she got mad at me because of that. She got mad because I told her</br> that stuff. I was like, &quot;Well, I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying</br> look, sometimes things happen for a reason.&quot; I was like, &quot;Everything</br> happens for a reason, I believe that.&quot; My mom didn't like that about me.</br> She didn't like the fact that I was so accepting of the things that</br> happened to me in life. She was like, &quot;You shouldn't be like just oh well,</br> everything happens for a reason or shouldn't be too upbeat about stuff.&quot;</br> Not upbeat, but yeah, upbeat. I shouldn't be taking it so good, so lightly.</br> She wanted me to take it more heavily. She's like, &quot;Hey, you're getting in</br> trouble. You're going to get deported. You should be taking it more</br> heavily, you should be upset.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm like, &quot;Mom, everything happens for a reason. Everything happens</br> for a reason. Every single thing is either whether you believe it or not,</br> everything happens for a reason. There is already a plan for you type</br> thing.&quot; I believe in that type of stuff and I went to church when I was</br> younger. I did go to church when I was in junior high, and it was nice. It</br> taught me a lot of stuff and I do believe in God. I'm not going to say I'm</br> a follower, but I do believe in Him and I do believe in what they believe</br> here, which is La Santa Muerte, [Saint Death] and I believe in death.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If there's one thing that everybody believes in, it's death. Because</br> everybody says, nothing is promised but death. That's one for sure thing</br> that we all have is that. Believing in the death here, believing in La</br> Santa Muerte [Saint Death] like the guys, it's a lot more credible. It's</br> like yeah, we know death is there. God, everybody says God is here, there's</br> the books and the testaments, there's no really actual evidence besides the</br> books. Yeah, there's some stuff that do... I like that type of stuff and it</br> gets my mind over, but I was never too much of a follower. My mom didn't</br> like that. She was like, &quot;You need to take it seriously.&quot; I was like, &quot;I</br> am, but it's already happened. It's already done and it's already</br> happening, it's in process, what can I do about it? I can just hope for the</br> best and prepare for the worst.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, you seem to have dealt with your anger management issues.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years of therapy did help out a lot.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: I was going to say, you didn't get angry at this. You should be happy</br> that you didn't angry.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. Those two years that I did inside the juvie, every day was</br> therapy. It was therapy every single day, one hour of therapy every day and</br> we had at least a one hour session, a personal session twice a week. Those</br> really helped a lot. They did help a lot on my anger. At this point in</br> time, my mom doesn't like the fact that I don't get angry. She's like,</br> &quot;This stuff should make you mad. The stuff that should make you mad,</br> doesn't make you mad and the stuff that shouldn't make you mad, you get mad</br> about small stuff like...&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get mad about stuff as if I was an OCD type thing. I would get mad</br> because somebody grabbed something and then leaves it over here on the</br> couch and doesn't put it back on the table. I'll get mad at stuff like</br> that. That upsets me more than, &quot;Hey, this person's talking bad about you.&quot;</br> My mom is really picky about that. My family members are really nosy.</br> They're always like, &quot;Hey, did you see what Axel published on Facebook?&quot; I</br> mean, it could be just a funny picture about a certain thing, but just</br> because I posted it, they think I'm doing those things or I'm into those</br> things. I'm like, it's just something I found funny and I wanted to share</br> with people. I'm not doing it.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My mom's like, &quot;You know how your family is.&quot; So now it got to the</br> point where I can't even express myself on social media just because of my</br> family? I'm like, &quot;Mom, you know that I'm not doing that stuff. You talk to</br> me every day. And they're not helping me, they're not supporting me,</br> they're not doing anything for me. So why let them affect anything that has</br> to do with me?&quot; She's like, &quot;I just don't like telling me.&quot; I'm like,</br> &quot;Ignore them, block them. If they're really family, they shouldn't be doing</br> that type of stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: She's like, &quot;Why are you taking it so lightly? You should be mad, you</br> should get mad that people are talking about you.&quot; I was like, &quot;Mom, at</br> this point in time, I don't really care what people say about me, because I</br> know who I am. I know who I am and what I do. If they say it, if it's true,</br> okay. I know it's true. If they say it and it's not true, okay. It's not</br> true.&quot; I don't care. Okay, go ahead, say it all you want to. I know it's</br> not true, it doesn't affect me at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I get more mad at people talking about my family, talking about my</br> inner circle, my friends or anything like that. If somebody says something</br> about a family member, I'm definitely getting physical with that person or</br> if somebody says something about a friend of mine that's close by, I will</br> confront them about it. Be like, &quot;Hey, if you're going to say something</br> about them, say it when they're here, say it to their face. Don't be</br> talking about all that right now when they're not here and they can't</br> defend themselves.&quot; I'm not into that, I don't like that at all.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I'm more likely to get into a fight or into a physical altercation</br> with somebody or even verbal altercation with someone, because of them</br> saying something about somebody I care about than them saying... They could</br> say the most horrible things about me and I just brush it off my shoulders.</br> I really don't care because I know who I am. But if they anything either</br> minor or whatever it is about somebody I care about, that upsets me a lot</br> because they have no reason to say it, they don't know the person or the</br> person's not even there. So I'm like, &quot;Hey.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If the person is there, I'll be like, &quot;Hey, defend yourself, man.&quot;</br> They're like me. They're like, &quot;It's not even true, I don't really care.&quot;</br> I'm like, &quot;All right, cool. Let's just ignore them then.&quot; But I'm more</br> likely like that. My mom told me that too. She's literally learned that on.</br> She's like, &quot;Yeah, I noticed that.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a heart of gold,</br> but you let people take advantage of you and let people step over you and</br> stuff like that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I don't really care about that. I know what my</br> life is, I know what I do with my life, I know exactly where I'm going,</br> what I'm doing with my life. If people want to say all this stuff, okay.</br> They can say it. I can either let it affect me and bring me down or I can</br> let it affect me and I go at them or I go physically with them or go argue</br> with them, whatever. Or I can just let them say what they want to say and</br> act like nothing was said at all.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;It's not affecting me.&quot; If it gets to the point where</br> it's affecting me, like maybe they're talking about me and my wife or</br> talking about me doing something that is going to upset my wife and now my</br> wife is upset with me or something like that, it's causing problems in my</br> personal life, then yeah. I will get upset at that point, but if you want</br> to say, &quot;Hey, Axel's this, Axel's that, Axel did this and oh, he's this and</br> that. I heard he also was into this.&quot; All right, cool. But if you say</br> something like, &quot;Hey, did you know Axel was messing around with this girl</br> and even his wife doesn't know?&quot; And then all of a sudden my wife is like,</br> &quot;Oh, really?&quot; So now she's mad at me for something I didn't do just because</br> they said it. Okay, so now I'm going to get upset because now you're making</br> my wife, my ex, my girl, whatever it is, you're making my parents upset</br> because of that.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: When my mom calls me and tells me all that stuff about my family</br> members, I don't get upset at my mom. My mom's like, &quot;Hey, they're all</br> saying this and this and that.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom, just ignore them.&quot; She's</br> like, &quot;No, how can you just ignore it?&quot; I'm like, &quot;Mom.&quot; I was like, &quot;Look,</br> I never hear them say anything or see them say anything. You're the one</br> that tells me. I get upset at you because you're telling me all this stuff</br> that you already know and it's upsetting me that you get upset, and it</br> upsets me that the fact that they're making you upset. I'm upset at you for</br> letting them get you upset and I'm upset at them for even worrying about</br> that stuff.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: You never worried about me when I was in the States and when I was</br> going through all that jail time. None of you wanted to help me out with a</br> recommendation card because you were like, &quot;Oh no, because if we put our</br> information on there, they're going to have us on record and they're going</br> to come looking for us.&quot; I'm like, &quot;No, it's nothing like that. They're not</br> even asking for your address. They just want your name and they want you to</br> write something good about me, something that you know about me. Stuff that</br> you're saying that I'm a good person to society.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah, I had recommendation cards from the church where I used to go,</br> church friends, some school teachers. I had a recommendation from a lot of</br> places but my family members were never there. And that's why now that</br> they're all worried about what I'm doing over here, I'm like, come on now.</br> If I was over there and things went bad over there, where my mom was</br> actually at and where she was able to actually get to know me and punish me</br> in some way, and nothing helped over there, what makes you think that if</br> I'm doing whatever you think I'm doing over here, you telling my mom is</br> going to do anything? If it didn't work over there when I was there</br> physically, it's not going to work over the phone. Come on now.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I got to the point where my Facebook, it's nothing but family members</br> and I know that I cannot put anything on there because it's nothing but my</br> family. Any other social media, I can do whatever I want but Facebook is</br> strictly family, strictly professional.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you got to watch stuff.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Well, I have a last question for you. That is what are your dreams?</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: My dreams? I always had the same dream since I was younger. I always</br> liked what I saw between my mom and my stepdad, and I always wanted a</br> family. At this point, I got three babies with three different moms, and my</br> mom tells me, &quot;You need to stop.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm just trying to have my</br> family.&quot; She's like, &quot;You have a family.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, but I want</br> that family like you and my dad had.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that's always been my dream, to have my... I don't want fancy</br> stuff, I don't want to be rich, I don't want to be famous, none of that. I</br> just want to be able to have a family of my own. Be able to live with them,</br> be with them, actually see my kids grow up, see them become the young man</br> that they're going to be, the older man that they're going to be, instead</br> of just having to talk to them over the phone.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: There was a point in time, when I moved around, when I first got</br> here, moved in a place around here. That's where my family is at. I don't</br> have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over</br> there, since I had first got there, I was struggling. I didn't have a</br> phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,</br> anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a</br> year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the</br> minutes and stuff, since it was a little place, you had to go buy a card</br> with minutes to call. Once the card was over, you had to buy another card</br> or they had to pay and it wasn't good.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little</br> young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's</br> always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm</br> not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom</br> provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and</br> be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing</br> something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they</br> need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than</br> myself. Like I said, shoe brands, all that stuff don't matter to me. I want</br> to have my family, I want to be happy and make my kids happy. See my family</br> grow and see my kids grow. See what they become, because I expect them...</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: People always ask me. &quot;Hey.&quot; Because I did smoke before, I did smoke</br> weed and everything but they're like, &quot;Hey, what if your kid one day did</br> something like that?&quot; I was like, the only thing I really wish, I never</br> really saw that bad. Obviously, they're legalizing it for a reason in</br> certain states.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: Yeah.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I just wish my kids would tell me. I want them to have that</br> confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to</br> have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in</br> the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be</br> safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,</br> go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see</br> me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that</br> stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All</br> right.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but</br> at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to</br> help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be</br> able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm</br> not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's</br> why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that</br> they could say, &quot;Hey, your dad's never there.&quot; He's like, &quot;No, but he's</br> always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him</br> emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me</br> that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in</br> my life important.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my</br> wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't</br> have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from</br> here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We</br> weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just</br> felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were</br> going to grow up and be like, &quot;Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did</br> everything. He's the one that get the money.&quot; She's like, &quot;I want to feel</br> like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own</br> heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: I was like, &quot;Yeah, you don't have to say that it's my part or</br> anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own</br> stuff.&quot; She's like, &quot;No, but I just still feel like it's difficult.&quot; So</br> right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix</br> things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,</br> and I understand my mom too at the same time like, &quot;Hey, you don't want to</br> go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do</br> you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.&quot;</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: So you’re trying to work it out.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah. I'm trying to work it out. My main priority is my kids. The</br> girl, I like her too and I love her, I still do have a lot of feelings for</br> her and I tell her. And I understand her situation. I know she wants to</br> work. She wants to feel useful and I understand that. Even here, when I'm</br> here and they give me vacations or anything like that, I take my vacations</br> and after three, four days, I'm like, &quot;All right, I'm bored, I want to go</br> back to work.&quot; Even though I don't like work, but my main issue, my main</br> priority is my kids, my family and that's my dream for me. I want to have a</br> stable family, want to be able to have the house for my kids and see them</br> grow up. That's it. That's the last thing I could ask for.</br>      </br>      </br> Anne: That's amazing. That's a really wonderful dream and I think you're</br> going to make it.</br>      </br>      </br> Axel: Yeah.</br>      </div><\p>
