   Claudia: First things first, this is Claudia and I am interviewing Danielel 14<br>
   and way before we start, I just want to say thank you for coming out here<br>
   and talking with us and with me. I know that sometimes talking about these<br>
   things and sharing these stories can be a little painful and bring about<br>
   emotions that you don't really want to feel or relive, but it's important<br>
   to know your story and to really help people understand the realities of<br>
   migration and the human side of it. I think that this is really awesome<br>
   that you've been talking to us and telling us this because it's really<br>
   going to be helpful.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, it's my pleasure, Claudia. [inaudible 00:00:39] is a lot better<br>
   now. If I were to come and maybe tell you my story about three, four years<br>
   ago I probably wouldn't have been able to. Right now, emotions, they’re not<br>
   mixed anymore. I pretty much know what's going on, know where I stand and<br>
   know my options. Once you got all that stuff cleared out, your story just<br>
   becomes a story and not a feeling anymore. My story is like, I'm pretty<br>
   sure more like any young guy that was born in the States without a... Well,<br>
   even the 90s, the 90s I think it was the toughest year for the United<br>
   States when it comes down to gang members.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: When I was young, living in Illinois, nothing but gang members all<br>
   around, people getting shot all the time, people getting beat up all the<br>
   time so that's how it was when he was young. When I realized that's not the<br>
   one life I... That even though to me wasn't as bad as the world seemed like<br>
   it is. It was still not legal. It was still against the law. When you're a<br>
   gang member, you can't look left, you can't look right, you can't say this.<br>
   You can’t be mad. They block you from all kinds of emotions. The only<br>
   emotion for you to have with the law, it's you want to change and you're<br>
   going to do right and be a right citizen. Sometimes you're just young and<br>
   you don't know what you're doing. You just don't realize it till you grow.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Unfortunately, I didn't realize it till I was here in Mexico. I got<br>
   here to Mexico, I had two kids over there in Georgia when I was 18. By the<br>
   time I was 18, people tried to kill me about two or three times by the time<br>
   I was 18. Plenty of my cousins got shot, plenty of my friends got killed<br>
   right in front of me, across the street. All this stuff is basically all I<br>
   lived till I was 18.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You were born in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I was born in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You were born in Mexico, and so why did your family leave?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, we left because my mom was a single mom and my dad, I don't<br>
   know, he had residential at that time, I think. I don't know how he works,<br>
   but he would come to the United States, work for six months and back and<br>
   forth. He's done this since before we were born. He's still doing it now. I<br>
   don't know if he became a US citizen. I know he was arrested and I don't<br>
   know if he ever became a US citizen. At one point my mom would just take<br>
   care of my grandparents, well, my dad's parents. At one point she just got<br>
   tired of it and decided to go to the States and she took us to the States<br>
   without following my dad. She went to the States but not to follow my dad<br>
   to look for work.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: And then she saved some money and then she took us to the States<br>
   after a year that she was saving money, then she took us to the States.<br>
   That's how we got there. It was four of us, the youngest one out of four, I<br>
   think it was one or two years old. I can't recall. I was the oldest one, I<br>
   was seven, eight. Something like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you remember your first day?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: In the States? Well, no. I have a lot of memories about the States,<br>
   but not my first day. To this day, I remember the first time I crossed on<br>
   the bus, I was seven or eight like I said, that I remember. Then at the<br>
   State I remember the school I got to, I think it was _____ School. I<br>
   remember the school, the kids and stuff like that, but not specific dates.<br>
   No.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Is there any teacher or friend or someone from school that you<br>
   remember?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: No, not really. When I was in school, I wasn't too friendly. When I<br>
   first started being friendly, that's when I started knowing gang members.<br>
   Before that I was like, people didn't like me, things like that. I was the<br>
   shortest one, the little one, the ugly one or things like that until I<br>
   became friends, started making friends and it started really with girl<br>
   friends. I started being friends with girls that were gang members and<br>
   that's how it started. To me it was like, "I'm bored all the time and now<br>
   I'm having fun with guys and girls up and down." One thing led to another.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Tell me more about involvement in gangs and that sort of thing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, I never really liked the idea of gangs, it was more like<br>
   something mandatory for any Hispanic, even white people and black kids were<br>
   trying to be gang members with Mexicans. But Mexicans were like...<br>
   Everybody knows Mexicans are violent and they like to fight. They don't<br>
   take no for answers, it's here and everywhere. It was like that. Most of<br>
   the gang members who I met, like I said, it was for fun. It was always for<br>
   fun until things started getting serious and when things started getting<br>
   serious, I did not like it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: The first time I recall becoming a gang member, I've always hang<br>
   around gang members all my life, but when I had just turned 13, I got<br>
   kicked out of some school in ___________, which I know a lot of gang<br>
   members there, but I wouldn't affiliate with them. I just knew them. I just<br>
   dressed like them, looked like them, act like them, but that was it. I<br>
   would still go home from home to school. When I came back to _____, because<br>
   I went to _______, came back to ____ when I was 13, I came back with the<br>
   friends I grew up with before I went to ______ and all the friends that I<br>
   grew up with now, they were all gang members from the same gang.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I just showed up to a house and they're all just getting drugged up,<br>
   doing paint, and I don't know what kind of other drugs they were doing. I<br>
   got there and they took me to their crew and when I got to the crew, there<br>
   was 20 people there, half of the people they know me. The person that took<br>
   me there was one of my cousins. I got there to the crew and I started<br>
   realizing, I know a lot of guys there, are guys that I grew up with.<br>
   Anyway, I walked to the crew and this guy runs up to me with a knife. He's<br>
   like, "You don't belong here, ..you're stupid." I heard some other guy<br>
   scream out, "Hey, that's my boy, Daniel. Nobody touches Daniel." I looked up<br>
   and I'm like, "Johnny." His name was Johnny.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I'm like, "What's up, Johnny, what are you doing here?" He's like, "I<br>
   don't know man, you know what I’m saying?" I'm like, "What do you mean?"<br>
   He's like, "This and that." I’m like, "Man, you sound dumb. What are you<br>
   talking about? What are you doing? Look at you." And he's like, "No, Daniel,<br>
   life has changed, blah blah blah." I'm like, "I don't know what you're<br>
   talking about, man. I dress like you, I look like you, but I don't get<br>
   you." He’s like, "No, this and that. You want to click it?" I’m like,<br>
   "Yeah, I’ll click in." Like nothing. I clicked in. The next thing I know,<br>
   I'm with them up and down.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I realized what kind of life they're having, which was nothing but<br>
   drugs, getting in fights, getting locked up, being rebels to their family,<br>
   to their mom. You don't say, everybody's like this and I disagreed. I would<br>
   always disagree. I always tell them, "You're wrong and you could do better.<br>
   Hey, don't do that." They didn't like that. They wouldn't like me giving<br>
   them the contradictory all the time. They wanted people to be around...You<br>
   know what I'm saying? And I would be like, "I'm not scared, I’ll fight you,<br>
   I’ll fight you, I'll fight them, I'll fight whoever, it don't matter, but I<br>
   just don't like your mentality. It's just dead. I don't see it. I don't see<br>
   the purpose."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I got fed up with them and like I said, they were always getting in<br>
   jail, always getting in trouble and it was just not something I agree with.<br>
   I got fed up with them and I'm like, "Hey, you know what? I don’t like your<br>
   game." They're like, "What do you mean, Daniel? Why are you always saying<br>
   this dumb things?" And I'll be like, "It's just that I'm tired of you guys.<br>
   All you guys do is talk about the same thing. You don't ever have a<br>
   different conversation. I don't see a future in what you're doing. I don't<br>
   care what is your reason, I just don't see it. I don't get you, man.<br>
   Because I recalled you when I knew you before, you're not the same guy. I<br>
   don't want to be part of your game."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: He said, "Well, you've been talking too much, I’m going to put you in<br>
   the group and we're going to beat your head." I’m like, "Bring it, man. No,<br>
   get me out of here. I told you I don't like your life." They put me in a<br>
   group of about 20 guys, started beating me up. Well, anyways, I thought all<br>
   that was funny. To me, I would just keep thinking, "Well, I'm not going to<br>
   be like you. I don't care how many times you beat me; I still don't want to<br>
   be like you." I started doing that, I do not want beef, so they started<br>
   beating me up. The leader at the time was... What was his name? Dofo,<br>
   Alonzo, I can’t remember anything. Anyways, he's like, "No, once you're a<br>
   gang member you’re a gang member for life, blah blah blah."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I’m just laughing at him. He pulls off a knife at me and comes<br>
   towards my stomach. When he did this, the people that knew me when we were<br>
   young for one second, they knew, they understood me for one sec and they<br>
   jumped. Everybody's jumping, "No, nobody touches him. Anybody touches Daniel,<br>
   the gang is over right now and we will kill each other right now if you<br>
   touch Daniel." Everybody started jumping. "Yeah, I'm with Daniel and I'm with<br>
   Daniel." I'm getting kicked out of the clique and the group is... I don't<br>
   know what they did, they got a bond that second and I think that is the<br>
   memory why I came back to be their friend.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Not because I wanted to be in the gang, because for the first time I<br>
   was like, "Man, these people got my back." Even though I turned my back<br>
   against them, they still have my back. That's what it was like. Next day we<br>
   showed up to school and I will see all my friends be like, "No Daniel, we<br>
   can't give you the handshake anymore blah blah." It got to me, it hit me<br>
   and I was like, "You know what I can’t be without you guys can I just click<br>
   back in?" They clicked me back in the next day in school. Then after that,<br>
   I never changed. I still told the all the gang members I've built all my<br>
   life because all I did was gang members over there. Even to this day I have<br>
   to deal with it here in Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: If you could ________, "Who are the gang members?" It’s big time.<br>
   Half of them have killed somebody. I'm still dealing with this all the<br>
   time, except that when I got here to Mexico, to me, it was a new beginning,<br>
   a new beginning that I couldn't find in the States because no matter where<br>
   I went in the State, it was the same thing. No matter how bad I wanted to<br>
   say, "This is not the life I want." It was the life that I had and there<br>
   was no way around it. Then you meet some people that don't accept a no for<br>
   an answer and they're violent and it becomes not only you, your family,<br>
   your kids. It becomes a big thing. Not only you have the gang members as<br>
   your enemies, you have the cops as your enemies. It becomes a big, big<br>
   mess.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I got here to Mexico, I got here to Teletech. When I started working<br>
   here at Teletech I’m like the ripe gang member for everybody at Teletech. I<br>
   had tattoos in my neck, I covered them up, on my hands, everywhere. It was<br>
   a big beef, and I was like, "You know what? I don't care about this. The<br>
   only reason..." That's the only reason I never came to Teletech because I<br>
   knew about how Teletech was. That would be the main reason why I never came<br>
   to Teletech, or I would never get involved in people coming from the<br>
   States. I would get involved in people in Mexico, the works in Mexico, the<br>
   way Mexicans live. I would never want to come here. It got to the point<br>
   where we're dealing so much the jobs in Mexico but they weren't making the<br>
   cut.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: They weren't doing it, I was stressing, I was struggling, I was<br>
   getting all messed up. I decided, I'm like, "It's been five years and I<br>
   haven't liked one thing about Mexico except that I'm married, I got two<br>
   kids now." One kid and the other one is my wife. And I was like, "Well, I'm<br>
   going to try Teletech." How am I going? How am I getting a flight? I was<br>
   like, "I know I'm just block in there and I'm going to get in a fight. I<br>
   don't even know why I'm going." I showed up anyways and when I showed up, I<br>
   don't know if it was God or what it was, I got along with everybody even<br>
   though they knew who I was.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: There was a lot of problems sometimes it was catching you up in the<br>
   bathroom, catching you around the corner, pulling out knives around the<br>
   building, telling you you're this, you're that. At the same time, I had<br>
   guys from their end that got to know me and they were willing to get in<br>
   between those issues. I worked with Teletech for about a year having these<br>
   conflictions and then I got fired and I decided to clear my tattoos. That's<br>
   when I put tattoos over my tattoos and came back to Teletech and from then<br>
   I have not had a gang problem. Probably since I was a little kid, the only<br>
   time I didn't have to worry about gangs was since I covered my tattoos for<br>
   about a year, year and a half. And it's never been my choice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: It's never been something I wanted. At one time, the one time that I<br>
   was by my own friends over there, they tried to beat me so many times, they<br>
   pulled knives on me so many times, here. No, not here in the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: In the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Right here, it was something like that, but it never got to that<br>
   point, and it will be always because of the same reasons. I would never<br>
   understand them. Even though I would stay with them, I would still always<br>
   not understand them. I'll always be like, "You're doing wrong guy. You're<br>
   doing wrong, you shouldn't be doing that. Why are you doing? Get a job.<br>
   Fucking lazy ass." Things like that. I'd be like, "Get your ass up, man.<br>
   Stop fucking crying. If you don't want this life, do something about it."<br>
   Cops will come around, they want to run and I be like, "Why are you<br>
   running? Talk to the guy, say what's up. Why are you running? Because the<br>
   first thing you do when you run, is they’re going to run after you. Come<br>
   on."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I always do that. Well, I never had a real chance to bond with cops<br>
   till I got to Georgia. When I got to Georgia, I bought a birth certificate<br>
   and a social security from another guy. I walk at the police station and I<br>
   became that guy. When I became that guy, I no longer had to worry about the<br>
   law because now I'm legal. I got to bond with the law and I got to made a<br>
   lot of friends with police officers. That's the only reason why probably<br>
   I'm not still in prison. Once I got to bond with them, it was different.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Okay, got you. Tell me first, did you ever partake in any of the<br>
   gang activities whatever, that sort of thing, and fighting?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yes, of course. Of course. All the time. This is the thing, when it<br>
   would be something like that, I would always... I made a lot of enemies, my<br>
   friends a lot because I think when two guys fight, they talk a<br>
   conversation, even though they don't say anything. At the end of the fight,<br>
   usually there's talking, nice talk and a lot of them became my friends, a<br>
   lot of them after a fight, after whatever and say whatever, meet again. I<br>
   had a lot of friends that were my enemies, a lot and through conflicts we<br>
   became friends with a lot of them. That was always because I think it was<br>
   because the mentality that I had, like I said, I never agreed with it. It<br>
   was life. It is how it is, couldn't do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I've seen a lot of fights. They used to make groups that sometimes<br>
   whenever it would get to me, one of my friends would get hurt. Then you<br>
   would feel like you have to do something about it. There'll be times where<br>
   you will have to just go do something, fight people or whatever. One time,<br>
   we would go look for people, for crews, you would find crews over there, 20<br>
   people, 30 gang members in one spot. They will go a lot to dance floors and<br>
   things like that. We would go there, groups together, 30 of us. We'd go on<br>
   cars back to back. We get there. Once we would get there, I used to love<br>
   the fighting.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I'd be like, "Yeah, fight him. Let him know you're better than him.<br>
   Fight him. That's it. Fight him. That's it. Just fight him. Let him get up.<br>
   Let him know that you beat him. That's it." But they wouldn't do this. They<br>
   would want to crash them, destroy them, leave them dead on the floor and<br>
   things like that. Cracked head opens, people shaking, tweaking, things like<br>
   that. Every time I would notice something like that, I will never agree.<br>
   One time we went to the dance floor and saw some guys, we would send in<br>
   bait. We would send one guy into the dance floor representing his colors to<br>
   start up something and they will chase them out of course, but you will<br>
   walk out thinking you're 10 and we're 30 outside waiting on you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: You see what I'm saying? We would do that, and they started doing<br>
   this. I would go with them, at first it was fun. Like I said, when it was<br>
   just regular fights, it was fun, but when they started bringing guns, bats<br>
   and things like that, I would just think it was too much. They come out,<br>
   they didn't know we're waiting for them. As soon as they notice we're<br>
   waiting for them they started running everywhere. They caught up one guy,<br>
   he tried to jump over a fence, they caught him up, dragged him down, and<br>
   they started hitting him bad with bats on the head, crashing on, destroying<br>
   him. I was just watching and they wanted me to hit him so I wouldn't do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I’m like, "Why would I hit him? He's taken already, man. What are you<br>
   doing hitting him with a bat on his head while he's unconscious? Come on,<br>
   what do you want?" Anyway, he's like, "No, Daniel, you always been this way<br>
   and this ain't your life. I don't know what you do with us, blah blah<br>
   blah." When this happened, his wife comes running, the guy looks like he's<br>
   dead. Comes running and she's like, "No, leave him alone. Blah blah." She's<br>
   crying. I notice she's pregnant. She had a big belly and the guy that I was<br>
   arguing with already wanted to hit her with a bat. I'm like, "Hey, if you<br>
   hit her with a bat, I'm hitting you with a bat” and everybody surround me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: All the guys are like, "Daniel, why are you always like that, man? You<br>
   need to calm down. This is the life we live in." And I'd be like, "No, I'm<br>
   not going to agree with that, man. I can't agree with that. I cannot agree<br>
   with it." I said," If you hit her, I'm hitting you." They didn't hit her,<br>
   they left her alone and we moved on. I didn't let the guys do that to her.<br>
   Everybody, it don't matter is what gang you’re around being with in the<br>
   States, they know who I am. They know that I will say no to the majority of<br>
   the things they do. They know me for these things. But yeah, that's one of<br>
   the things I've seen over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: The story that has to do with the police officer, is it in Mexico<br>
   or in the States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, everything had to be over there before I got deported. Right<br>
   here in Mexico, I've never really dealt with the law. Like I said, when I<br>
   got here, it was like a new beginning for me. To me it was like a new<br>
   beginning, different decisions, people didn't know me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Alright. I guess tell me the story about the police officer and<br>
   also just leading up to how you got back to Mexico.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, the first time that I got back here to Mexico, it was, the<br>
   police officer had just pulled me over. Well, he pulled two or three guys<br>
   over. The reason why he pulled us over is probably because they were gang<br>
   members also. I didn't know the police officer. I think they knew him. He<br>
   pulled us over and he wanted to search the car and I wouldn't let him. I<br>
   told him, "No, you're not going to search the car." And he didn't search<br>
   the car. Well, he pulls him over again a week later and tells me that, "I<br>
   know who you are. You're illegal. I'm just waiting for you to turn 18 and I<br>
   deport you." He did that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: When I was 18, on my birthday, he went and picked me up at my house<br>
   with order of arrest and he deported me. That's how that happened. He put<br>
   me in a prison, well, not a prison in a cell of 30 guys and most of them<br>
   had already done something. A couple of them would tell you stories where<br>
   they stabbed so many people, blah, blah, people without teeth all tatted<br>
   up. Just people that you can tell they lived it big time and I was the<br>
   youngest one in there. The cop, I think he did that on purpose. He scared<br>
   me, I signed the paper and that's how I came over. If I would’ve fought<br>
   that at that time, well, I was US citizen by culture. I didn't know that at<br>
   the time. If I had known, I would have fought it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I didn't, I signed and I came here to Mexico. That was the first time<br>
   I got deported. The second time I got deported, well, I got here to Mexico,<br>
   I turned around US citizen and I'm back over there in the States, within a<br>
   week after I got deported. That's when I went to Georgia. When I got to<br>
   Georgia, same thing. I'm bald headed, tatts, the way I walk, the way I<br>
   dress, all them things. I started working again like I've always worked.<br>
   I've always worked, I never not worked since I was 16, I've never not<br>
   worked, I always worked. I was working, at that time, I was a machine<br>
   operator for _____ products in ____, Georgia.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, anyways at that time I had to stay over late at night, we had<br>
   to fix some things with the machine so I stayed late at night and I didn't<br>
   live too far from there, so I decided to walk home. The way I was walking<br>
   home, I seen a white girl, regular white girl, and she's like, "Hey, you,<br>
   you're so cute. Blah blah." She starts talking to me so I start talking to<br>
   her and we're just chilling there talking. Next thing you know, I got cops<br>
   everywhere. Pom pom pom. Cops everywhere. "Hit the floor." And I'm like,<br>
   "I'm not going to the floor." They’re like, "You better go to the floor."<br>
   I'm like, "I'm not going to the floor. If you want to arrest me, you better<br>
   walk over and put the handcuffs on me because I'm not going to the floor."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: They walked over, they arrested me, they took me to jail and the girl<br>
   walked off. She just walked off. Anyways, I get there and the sheriff tells<br>
   me, he says, "Well, you know why I arrested you?" And I'm like, "No." He<br>
   says, "The girl you were with is my niece." I like, "I didn't know, I just<br>
   met her right now. I've just seen her." He's like, "Well that's my niece,<br>
   and I just wanted to let you know. Don't bring that bullshit about me being<br>
   racist, blah, blah, blah." He says, "Because I'm not." He wasn't and he<br>
   said, "But that was my niece and I don't like the way you look." He said,<br>
   "If I cannot find something wrong with you right now, you will be released<br>
   in 48 hours." And I was a smart aleck, I was like, "Well, you got 72 hours<br>
   according to the law."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I was a smart aleck. He's like, "Well, yeah. You're right. I got 72<br>
   hours." He said. I was just smart. He said, "Well, in 72 hours...." He<br>
   says, "If I cannot find something wrong with you, I'm going to release you.<br>
   But if I can, I guarantee you I'm not going to release you." 72 hours, they<br>
   realized that I had just got deported a couple months before that and they<br>
   deported me again. That was my second deportation. That deportation, well,<br>
   I did the same thing. I got to Mexico, I turned around and I'm back in<br>
   Georgia, but in ____, Georgia, no longer in ____. That's when my mom told<br>
   me.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: She's like, "Well, why don't you do the same thing everybody's doing?<br>
   Go buy you a birth certificate, a social security card, walk into the<br>
   police station and that's it." That's what I did. From then, from when I<br>
   was 18 till I was 27, in the eyes of the law, I was legal. Even though in<br>
   Georgia I was always fighting, I was always doing things like this, I got a<br>
   bond with the cops. Even though I was always fighting, to me, it was always<br>
   just fights, nothing else. I was always getting involved in the pool<br>
   tournaments, bowling tournaments, basketball tournaments, whatever,<br>
   everything I could be involved with. Since it was the town, it was nothing<br>
   like ____ all the cops were like [snaps], they knew everything right away.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: They knew you, they knew about your family right away. They started<br>
   like, I was always in the... people call me Capo over there. People's<br>
   always in their mouth. It was new to them. Mexicans being everywhere. It<br>
   was new to them. It was Georgia country, Ku Klux Klan, it was different,<br>
   you know what I'm saying? It wasn't as common for them to have Mexicans not<br>
   being scared. It was weird for them. I passed that by, for around, and<br>
   people stopped being scared. People would just be calm and around people be<br>
   everywhere. Mexicans everywhere, white girls with Mexicans everywhere. I<br>
   got to bond with everybody. I was always cool with all the cops. Every time<br>
   I get in a fight, they let me go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Every time I was drunk, they let me go. They'd just be like, "It's<br>
   you again Dan..." They called me Robert, because I bought ID for somebody<br>
   else. "It's you again, Robert." I'm like, "Yeah, whatever." And they'd be<br>
   like, "Hey, go home." They never locked me up, never. I got into a lot of<br>
   the fights. They would never lock me up, they always let me go. The time<br>
   they locked me up, it was because like I said, I had a license, that night<br>
   I went to Walmart and I didn't bring my license with me and I got pulled<br>
   over by a cop I didn't know. This was the highway patrol. I knew everybody,<br>
   all the cops there. I got confident. I knew they weren't going to take me<br>
   to jail.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I went into Walmart and for reasons got lucky, the highway patrol was<br>
   passing by, he pulls me over, he didn’t know me, takes me to jail. They<br>
   fingerprint me and they identify that I was two people. Even though the cop<br>
   there, that took me in. He's like, "Robert." I'm like, "What?" He says,<br>
   "You're not Robert." I'm like, "Why do you say that?" He says, "You’re<br>
   Daniel, you're Danielel." I’m like, Yeah. What are you going to do?" He says,<br>
   "Look, I know you for a minute already." He says, "I like you a lot, I’m<br>
   going to let you go. Get your stuff, go home." He said, "But you're already<br>
   in the system." He says, "The way the system works now, federal will get<br>
   involved in double identities. There's nothing I could do."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: He says, "You got 30 days to leave Georgia or at least move somewhere<br>
   else, because now they're going to come get you." I was like, "Okay." I was<br>
   going to move. I packed up my expedition, we put the U-Haul at the back,<br>
   boom, we're moving. On the way, the U-Haul started weaving, started taking<br>
   me off the road. So we turned back around. We came back to Georgia and when<br>
   we got to Georgia, my mom's house had got flooded. When we got there, her<br>
   whole trailer was flooded. Since it was wood, sheet rock, everything was<br>
   just damaged. The floor, the walls, everything was damaged. I was like,<br>
   “That's my work. That's what I do.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I was like, "Okay, you know what? I'm just trying to fix your house<br>
   before I leave." I started off in the bathroom, we're talking about the<br>
   whole trailer got flooded, everything. Everything was damaged. I started<br>
   off with the bathroom, it took me about three weeks to get her house all<br>
   taken care of. When I was about to get done, I was like two or three days<br>
   from getting done, that's when the cops came over. That's when the federal<br>
   showed up to my house. They showed up to my house, hitting the door,<br>
   pointing guns, blah, blah, they’re on the trees, in the bushes, everywhere,<br>
   they’re everywhere.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's when actually everything got serious because that's when they<br>
   gave me a first felony reentry and the federal tried to give me my identity<br>
   theft, and they tried to put me a [inaudible 00:27:55]. When I got locked<br>
   up at that time, I acknowledged the system, how it worked, and I wouldn't<br>
   go buy it because my brother had just got locked up and just because he was<br>
   a gang member, he got locked in, he was doing 14 months, he ended up doing<br>
   eight years. I was like, "Well, I'm not going to fall for that." I told<br>
   them, I was like, "No. I'm not a gang member." He's like, "You're<br>
   everywhere. I see your tatts, your record." I was like, "Yeah, in your<br>
   mind, in your system, but I'm not going to fall for it."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: What they did is, since I wouldn't sign all those papers, it worked<br>
   on my behalf, all that stuff helped me out. Since I already knew all the<br>
   cops in Georgia, in ____, like I said, I knew lawyers, I knew judges, I<br>
   knew a lot of people and they were like real friends. I even had cops that<br>
   would go to my house, chill with me, drink a beer, just be there with their<br>
   car, me and my kids for half an hour, we'll see each other at the laundry,<br>
   bowling alley, playing pool. I know many cops personally. They sent a<br>
   lawyer to try to help me out with this case, and the lawyer got there and<br>
   he... I remember him to this day. With glasses, he had his hair all nappy,<br>
   like a redneck, regular redneck.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: He gets there and he's like, "Danielel, I can't believe they got me out<br>
   of the bed because of a Mexican." But I've only always understood the humor<br>
   because whenever they call me Wetback, I would call him Cracker. Not a big<br>
   deal. It's like... Anyway, this was normal for me. He got there, I'm like,<br>
   "Yeah, what did they send you here for?" He's like, "Well, I'm surprised<br>
   because everybody in _____, they're forcing me, they got me out of my bed<br>
   to force me to fight your case because they do not want to see you in<br>
   prison. It's just a surprise to me that you're Mexican and I'm doing this."<br>
   Anyways, he did. He fought the case, he beat the case.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I recall this day when I was in front of the judge, he's like, "Are<br>
   you guilty or not guilty?" I'm like, "I'm guilty." And he's like, "Shut<br>
   up." He looks at him and he's like, "Your honor..." He says, "...forgive<br>
   this man. He don't know what he's talking about." He fought the case and he<br>
   beat the case. He won the favor of the judge. They dropped the identity<br>
   theft and only left me with a felony first reentry. I only did a year for<br>
   that and then I came to Mexico. It was the first time I was actually in<br>
   Mexico, literally in Mexico. I was 27 and I didn't like it at all. I hate<br>
   it. It was something horrible. I remember when I was in the plane, all the<br>
   other times I knew it was going to turn around, but this time I did prison<br>
   time already.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: This time I know I got lucky, this time I understood the law now.<br>
   This time I stayed without kids. In order for me to stop dreaming about my<br>
   kids, it took me about three years to stop dreaming about them. It was<br>
   pretty tough. I'm at the plane and I'm looking at this, I'm looking,<br>
   leaving the States and I'm seeing where I'm going. When at first, it was<br>
   real, when I started noticing this and I'm like, "I can't believe I'm going<br>
   to stay here. I can't believe I'm going to stay." If I would've had<br>
   somebody there to tell me to turn around that second, I would have done it<br>
   again, but I didn't, I couldn't find nobody. I was just stressful. I was<br>
   crying to myself, nobody was watching me, with my head bowed down.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I was at the bus station and I was like, "I can't believe I'm doing<br>
   this. I can't believe I'm here. I can't believe this." I couldn't believe<br>
   it. Just with my head bowed down like this, and I started hearing birds. I<br>
   started feeling something calming me down. I’m like, "What's calming me<br>
   down?" Something calm me down. I started paying attention to my surrounding<br>
   and I started acknowledging that it was birds. It was birds singing<br>
   everywhere. I was like, " I never listened to this in the United States.<br>
   Okay, I’m going to calm down." I calm down, made my decision, got my bus<br>
   ticket and boom, I came from the borderline to _______.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I'm telling you, at that time, I wasn’t even actually making good<br>
   money in that time because I was working in a job in ______ and I was<br>
   making like 4,000 a week, which wasn’t good, pesos, like $200, but it was<br>
   more than enough for me at the time. I was sending my kids money in the<br>
   States for the whole year of 2009, a little bit of 2010. All the money that<br>
   I was making here, which was a little bit, I was able to send 150, every<br>
   two weeks and things like that. It wasn’t a lot, but I was doing that<br>
   because it was all right. Anyways, once that [place] shut down,<br>
   everything... It was real hard. The family members that I got here, I<br>
   started knowing who they were, I started disliking them and things like<br>
   that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I started recalling when they would go to the United States and I<br>
   would help them out and when I got here, they were just not... I didn't<br>
   like them at all, a lot. These people were people that just see you down so<br>
   they can laugh at you, trick you into... They have this thing, “no transa,<br>
   no avanza” which means the one that don't gets the other guys, not every...<br>
   It's weird. Mexicans here are weird. I started disliking these people. I<br>
   started being away from their lifestyle. I started being more... Felt more<br>
   lonely through the time, not having people here, not being able to bond,<br>
   not understand their jokes, not liking their culture, the way they are. The<br>
   culture is what they live before the history. Yeah, that's nice.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: The colors, they're artists, well, that's pretty, got beautiful<br>
   sites. But the people themselves, it's like when I got to construction, I<br>
   can be really good at basically all kinds of construction, machinery work,<br>
   anything. They will see your talent and they will try to pull you down<br>
   fast. Here, it's like you kiss butt, you can get up there. Even women,<br>
   women are laying with all the supervisors here where they go, guys are<br>
   kissing butt everywhere they go, anything the boss man says is funny and<br>
   I'm not used to these things. In the United States we're a little more<br>
   separate from each other. We could be quiet all day and it's not a big deal<br>
   and in here, Mexicans, it's like if you don't tell them what they want to<br>
   hear, they're trying to kick you out of the site.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: It's different. I started disliking the experiences in Mexico, I<br>
   started getting worse and worse that it got to a point where I was thinking<br>
   about maybe crossing the States again and that's when I make a decision to<br>
   see if I wanted to try ________ because I heard they were paying okay.<br>
   That's when I tried at ________ and ________ has been all right. It's been<br>
   better since I started working at ________ here in Mexico. It's getting<br>
   better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You've been back for?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Here? Since 2012, seven years. After 2012, that's when I made my mind<br>
   that I was not going to come back. That it was like, you know what, after<br>
   this you have to just deal with it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You said that you're married now?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, we are living together. I've been with her for... I think she's<br>
   the reason why I stayed, because when I first got here, like I said, I<br>
   wanted to... Literally I didn't want to stay. I knew I had to, but I didn't<br>
   want to stay. I started trying to ignore everything and I started to go out<br>
   more get drunk, try to make friends. I started trying to be involved in<br>
   Mexico now. Well, it did, it worked. I was getting involved back and forth,<br>
   girlfriends, guy friends, I started liking it, but at the same time I<br>
   wasn't liking it because I knew I was leaving my kids behind. I knew that<br>
   even though I had to stop thinking about them, I couldn't give them money,<br>
   it was still a conflict.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: When I met this woman, I seen her, I went to talk to her and we<br>
   started going out and I wasn’t thought that it was going to be serious and<br>
   one day she got pregnant. She got pregnant, I think that gave me life<br>
   again. I knew I was going to have a baby. After that, it was like, okay,<br>
   let's get used to it. You know what I'm saying? After my baby was born,<br>
   beautiful baby, to me, it was like, "Whatever you don't like about here,<br>
   whatever your reason is, whatever, it's kid stuff, you have to just do it.<br>
   You're not going to leave another kid here like you did in the states<br>
   suffering." You leave a kid here in Mexico it's going to be worse because<br>
   here is worse. There's no government support, there's no work and women get<br>
   beat up all the time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Drugs are everywhere, people are in every corner just doing drugs<br>
   like it's something normal, 24/7 every day. Years go by, nobody takes them<br>
   to jail, it's normal. That's how Mexico is. Every corner is normal. You see<br>
   people laying down on the floor dead, people, they just walk over them.<br>
   They don't care. They just keep going. They get to work at eight, they<br>
   don't care. I seen that many times so in that aspect, I don't think I'll<br>
   ever get comfortable enough with that because to this day I still not okay<br>
   by my wife just walking to school, taking my kids to school. You always<br>
   have that worry, there's so much kidnapping going around, women-napping.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: This, here in Mexico is like every day, is every day. Mexico is<br>
   pretty tough, but you just have to deal it, there's nothing you can do. You<br>
   have to just deal with it and do the best of it. Like I said, I'm glad I'm<br>
   in Teletech. I don't make as much as I want to to tell you the truth. I eat<br>
   better and dress better, but I still don't have what I want. I can't afford<br>
   a car. I can't afford my kids the best school. You know what I'm saying?<br>
   It's still a little bit tough, but it's better. I'm glad Teleltech is here.<br>
   Well, I'm glad I opened myself to a different world because not only<br>
   Teletach, there's a lot of different sites here, they pay just about the<br>
   same. It's okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I’m glad to hear that it's going better now.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah, it's nice. Like I said, it's nice but yeah, the past is always<br>
   hard. The past is always hard because when I grew up there, well, I was<br>
   never with my mom and I grew up alone, four kids growing up alone, four<br>
   guys. All my brothers are trouble makers. It's a little bit tough growing<br>
   up like that, but once you're grown, you're grown. You know what I'm<br>
   saying? You got to leave the past behind. You just got to live your life to<br>
   the best of days.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Is your mom and your siblings still in the US and your children?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. They're still over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What's that separation been like from all of them?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, that's been real hard, especially with my kids. To this day,<br>
   Facebook we could say gets to me. If I keep up with them, it gets to me, so<br>
   I don't keep up with them. I don't have Facebook. I don't have WhatsApp<br>
   because I don't want to. I did had it for a couple of years for my kids,<br>
   but it got to the point where my kids, we'd have nothing to talk about. I'm<br>
   always struggling, they're always doing something. It was different. They<br>
   don't want to hear your struggles. You can't feed them with your struggles.<br>
   They're having too much fun. They're at Burger King, they’re living the<br>
   American life. They're not living what you’re living. It's like you don't<br>
   have too many things in common.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: It got to the point when me and their mom spoke and they're like,<br>
   "You know what? You just got to back off for them. They're still crying for<br>
   you. It's been four years and they're still crying for you, you’re still<br>
   crying for them, you have to let us live. You have to back off for a little<br>
   bit." I was like, "Well, I'm going to try to. I'm going to try to back<br>
   off." I decided to back off for a little bit, not call them every day and<br>
   try to call them every month and that distance got farther. It just kept<br>
   getting farther and farther throughout the years. I haven't spoke to them<br>
   about a year now. When I was spoken to them last year, they didn't even<br>
   want to talk to me anymore. They're like, "No. It's just that I don't even<br>
   remember you anymore."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: How old are they?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Right now, she's 15. She just turned 15 in December and my son turned<br>
   14 in November. This has been since 2009 so it's been 10 years. She was<br>
   three and four when this first happened and they had seen me two times get<br>
   deported and I recall my son, he'd be like me, "I’m going to kill the<br>
   cops." That got me. When my son started being that, that got to me. I was<br>
   like, "No. I don't want my son to grow up the way I grew up." That's<br>
   actually what forced me to change, because I didn't want my son to have<br>
   that life. That's what really made that change I guess. I started telling<br>
   him, "No. I'm wrong, they're right. You can't live that way. You got to let<br>
   that go." That's past.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's always going to be hard, talking about my kids is always going<br>
   to be hard. That's just the way it is.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: This is more of a general question, but have you received any help<br>
   since you've been permanently back in Mexico, either from the government or<br>
   an organization like New Comienzos?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: No. Well, I haven't even looked for it, so I really don't know. I<br>
   really don't know. I don't know if there is some help or not. This, I heard<br>
   it because Adam was walking around over there and he just told me about it.<br>
   He said, "200 bucks." I be like, "Hey, I need 200 bucks."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I think I consider myself American. I don't like Mexico. I don't like<br>
   Mexicans. I've dealt with Ku Klux Klan, I've dealt with black people, it's<br>
   just never been a problem.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Tell me about the Ku Klux Klan.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, the Ku Klux Klan is like... Well, over there in Georgia-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Sorry. I know what they are, tell me about your experiences with<br>
   them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, my experience with them was, they'll be on the trucks saying,<br>
   "What's up red bag? What's up beaners." And things like that. A lot of<br>
   people would be scared. I wouldn't be scared. I'd be like, "Get off the<br>
   truck. What's up?" They’re different. They respect things like that. It's<br>
   like here and anywhere in the world, anybody that puts his foot down or<br>
   stands his ground is going to be respected. I'm not going to go with it all<br>
   my life, you don't be calling me beaner all my life. You know what I mean?<br>
   We're going to fight, but it got to the point, like I said, that bonds<br>
   people, bonds guys I think. At one point I be like, "Let's fight. Yeah,<br>
   let's fight."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: We'll get done fighting and they be like, "Hey, you want a beer?" And<br>
   I be like, "Yeah, let's drink a beer."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: With the KKK people?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, yeah. With the young guys more likely. Then you would meet a<br>
   lot of KKK people, like go there in Georgia, a lot of the KKK people, they<br>
   don't walk around like people see. Every now and then they have people, but<br>
   it's not like they just are and they have their own things. You don't see<br>
   it as often, and I would meet them. I would meet them, I would be at their<br>
   houses, I've had a lot of white people friends and it was never a big deal.<br>
   I think it was just more than culture. Everybody’s trying to be tough.<br>
   Everybody needs a reason to be tough. They’re just there. It's not really<br>
   something to me that ever got personal.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Okay. Throughout the interview I've noticed that you referred to<br>
   the Mexican people as them, as an othering?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. I think so.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: There's a distance between you and them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I think so, yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Do you want to speak more on that?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, I think it's more than culture more than anything. Mexicans are<br>
   weird. They're real weird. I’ve heard them say jokes and they'll say a joke<br>
   for a long time and nobody would laugh and then at the end of the joke<br>
   they'll say something like “[Son of a bitch]” and everybody starts laughing<br>
   and I’m like, "God almighty, I don't understand." Just because he talked<br>
   about it... I don't get it. In the United States people don't talk about<br>
   each other's mom because you're going to end up fighting. Here it's every<br>
   day. Your mama, your mama, I'm like, "Dude, I'm going to get off the car."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: They’re like “[Fuck your mother]”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah, you hear that all the time. You know what I’m saying? I think<br>
   it's more the culture and like I said, in the State, people don’t... I<br>
   don't think they fight for money as much than here in Mexico and I think<br>
   here in Mexico, everybody's trying to fight for money. I think it's like<br>
   the "I know I'm going to take from you, so you probably want to take from<br>
   me, so I'm always ready." This is something Mexicans are... It's not<br>
   something I was familiar with because over there in the States I was raised<br>
   like, "I got it. You got it. We got it." Here is different. I never really<br>
   was able to really, mingle. I don't. I can't have a conversation in Spanish<br>
   too long with somebody. Right away I don't want to be around for some<br>
   reason.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I don't know why. It's probably me. I don't know. Yeah, I do feel<br>
   that this is between me and Mexicans.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Speaking of moms, do you still speak with your mom?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. With her, I call her all the time still. Well, I'm like her<br>
   best friend. I've always been the shoulder she can lay on all the time.<br>
   We're always in contact all the time. Me and my mom are always in contact.<br>
   My brothers are always in contact still. A lot of family members from over<br>
   there, they look for me. Like I said, about two months ago, one of my<br>
   uncles came over from New York and he took me and all my family to<br>
   Acapulco, paid everything. We were so close, there's still a little bit of<br>
   touch. Of course there's been distances for a lot of different reasons.<br>
   Like I said, we don't have as many common things to talk about or relate<br>
   with, you know what I'm saying?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's probably why, but they still every now and then even though I<br>
   don't say hi on Facebook, they'll be like, "Say hi to Daniel. His ugly ass<br>
   don’t want to talk." [Laughs]. Things like that. They'll come over, they'll<br>
   send me perfumes or the shoes or things like that, every now and then. I'm<br>
   sure I'm still in their minds and they're still in mine, but different.<br>
   It's like right now I haven't had a cell phone in about a year, year and a<br>
   half. Why? Because I can go get me a 300-peso cell phone, but I don't want<br>
   it. I don't want it. I just don't want it. Then also I don't need it, I<br>
   don't go get it. That keeps me apart even more we can say, but I'm okay<br>
   with it. I don't feel that thing where I want to know what they're doing or<br>
   how they been, I don't.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Then every time there's a bad story or a bad something, bad news are<br>
   always going to get there quick. If there's something bad you're going to<br>
   know. That's why I don't ever have that necessity to have a cell phone and<br>
   things like that. Yeah, we still keep a little bit in touch with them. We<br>
   still get along.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: We're nearing the end here.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I know it's a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, you can take all the time you want. My supervisor's cool. I’m<br>
   getting paid while I’m here. He's got me on payroll while I'm over here.<br>
   I'm winning here and I'm winning over there. I told him, I was like, "Look,<br>
   I'm going to go over there or all you got to do is give me 200 bucks." He's<br>
   like, "Put yourself on coach, man, go get your 200."<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah. If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you<br>
   think you would have done?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, I think I would've... Right now I think about staying in the<br>
   States, I'll definitely stay with my kids. I would definitely have more<br>
   money than I have now. I think I'll be good I think in... Yeah. I think I'd<br>
   be better. I think I had my own stuff. When I got deported, I had three<br>
   cars. I had a Chrysler Sebring, a Cadillac and I had an Expedition and a<br>
   Tauro. So I had four cars when I got deported. I was making good money. I<br>
   had my own place. I never had to live under my mom since I was 16. I always<br>
   did good. I always had everything I needed and I had bank accounts for my<br>
   daughter, for my son, for my wife, for me. I always had money. I never<br>
   really... never cared.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Do you know what, to tell you the truth when I was in the United<br>
   States, I never cared about dressing fancy, wearing things nice, never<br>
   cared about that. Like I said, I think over there we don't worry about<br>
   money. In Mexico, that's all they worry about. It's like you're always<br>
   trying to look better so people could think you have something even you<br>
   don't, you know what I'm saying? You got a lot of shoes that are like 200<br>
   pesos and just they're new for about two weeks. For two weeks you feel like<br>
   you've got something, then in about two weeks it's going to rip off and<br>
   they're not going to work. But for two weeks everybody thinks you got<br>
   something. See what I'm saying? Even though it was 200 pesos, $10.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's how it is here in Mexico and over in the States is not. I<br>
   never worried about it. When I was over there, I was in Mexican sandals<br>
   with my ragged shirt. I never really cared. Also, my nice car, I knew I had<br>
   money, so I never cared. Here in Mexico it seems like I care more to look<br>
   good, to have good things, probably because you don't have it. It's more in<br>
   your mind. That's what I think. I don’t know. In the United States, like I<br>
   said, my wife, my kids had their own room, toy room, sleeping room. We had<br>
   a lot of space around the house. We had everything. She never had to work.<br>
   My kids never had to worry about anything. It was good. As long as your<br>
   family is good, you're good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: If I would be in the States, I'm thinking I would have a lot of<br>
   money, I think.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Now that you're back in Mexico and you have been back, what do you<br>
   think you'd like to do? What are your hopes and dreams basically?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Here? Well, like I said, first, I was a little bit stubborn. I would<br>
   think. I was thinking maybe if you work hard, you do hard, everything's<br>
   going to be all right. I started and no, if you need a career, you need a<br>
   paper. That's what I'm doing right now, I’m studying right now, I’m getting<br>
   my studies here in Mexico and hopefully I could get a diploma or something,<br>
   get an engineering or something different. Like I said, when I first got<br>
   here at Teletech, I didn't even know how to keyboard. Like I said, I never<br>
   cared about technology. I never needed it. I was always out in the street<br>
   or not in the street, like at the corner street. The bowling alley,<br>
   wherever, anywhere else, but not home. I never really cared about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I never needed it. I never needed technology. No. Back at the time we<br>
   had the beepers so we could have beepers. I never needed it. When I got<br>
   here, I wasn't used to it. When I got to Teletech, I didn't even know what<br>
   the key pads were. They gave me a training and I got better. I exceeded<br>
   everybody in the class. I became Doctor Dish faster than a lot of ways and<br>
   right now I'm back here. They took me in right away and I'm good. I got a<br>
   nice supervisor, he lets me do whatever I want as long as I know what I'm<br>
   doing. Right? You come to know what you're doing, you wake up knowing<br>
   you’re going to work, you got something you got accomplish. You don't go to<br>
   work to do nothing.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Once he knows, I know what I'm here for and he gives you breaks, like<br>
   right now. I told him, "Hey, look, I want to go." And he said, "Go, no<br>
   problem." If it had been somebody else he would be like, "No, you can't<br>
   even go to the bathroom." I've always been a hard worker no matter what<br>
   kind of employment I get; I'm thinking I'm always going to try to do my<br>
   best. This case, I didn't know what this was, I’m on top of my game now and<br>
   I didn't know nothing about it. I was lost of technology. You get me out of<br>
   cave, we got a... What do you call it? Evolutionary?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Evolve.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Evolve, evolution, I don’t know, whatever. You have to get into 2019<br>
   and then you have to 2020. You got to keep going.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah, with the times.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Exactly. You have to do it. Like I said, I don't have a need for<br>
   technology, but I know about technology. I know how to work myself.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Okay. First, before we get into the last set of questions, do you<br>
   think that in the near future you'll go back to the United States?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: No, I don't think so, unless Donald Trump gives a break. Other than<br>
   that, I don't think so. Illegally, I don't think so. I wouldn't dare to<br>
   leave my daughter for six months without her dad. If they give me five<br>
   years and I wouldn't be able to go through it. I wouldn't be able to. I'm<br>
   not going to. No, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't make that decision. If it's<br>
   legal, yes. If it's illegal, no. I wouldn’t do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: These last few questions are more of a reflection kind of thing.<br>
   There is a sentiment from a lot of migrants tied to this whole idea of<br>
   being binational that says that you're neither here nor from there, and I<br>
   was wondering what you think about that statement.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: No. I think I'm American. Yeah. [Laughs].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Alright.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: But I'm just here, but I don't know. I don't feel that way. Like I<br>
   said, a lot of people, they just want free things. They want easy things. I<br>
   understand a lot of governments are tough all the way around the world.<br>
   It's probably what most of migrants had to do. Like here, I think Mexico,<br>
   that's what gets more people. I don’t think it's the poverty, I think it's<br>
   the violence that gets people out of Mexico. I think that's what's it. I<br>
   think if the governments would just be more like United States, you did<br>
   something wrong and you're going in, no exceptions, no nothing. You're<br>
   looking at me wrong. I'm taking you in. I think that's perfect.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I think that's what every government needs to get. Simple, straight<br>
   up because people, we don't listen. We want things easy way all the time<br>
   and we don’t want to work for nothing. A lot of migrants, they just get to<br>
   leave their country, I think is violence more than poverty because land, we<br>
   got land, everybody can plant tomatoes, plant trees, plant whatever, you're<br>
   going to eat. If you go to the towns, nearest towns where people don't have<br>
   jobs, they're fat, they're eating good, they got all kinds of food, they<br>
   got all kinds of fruits, all kinds of animals. They got food, but they<br>
   don't feel safe. They're not going to let their daughter go out of their<br>
   house.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: They're not going to let their kids go out of his house. You know<br>
   what I'm saying? A lot of people do that. That's the reason they leave<br>
   because of violence. That’s how I feel. I don’t know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I'm very interested in hearing your opinion on why young Mexican<br>
   men in the United States turn into crime and gangs.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I think it's loneliness more likely. They don't understand you're<br>
   young, you're in a different country. It's like they're probably feeling<br>
   the reverse thing I'm feeling. They’re in their country, they don't<br>
   understand money yet, they don't understand duties yet, they just want to<br>
   have fun and unfortunately fun leads you to the wrong place. They’re young,<br>
   I think that's the only reason. They’re just young. Nothing you can do.<br>
   Then, I don't know. I think everybody does that. Because even white people<br>
   are like that. You get a lot of white people, they're involved in drugs,<br>
   they’re... You see that all the time. I don't know. I think it's just<br>
   people, man. I just think it's just people are just lonely. They're looking<br>
   for God and God is not showing up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Oh my God. That's true. Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's what I think and I think it's everywhere. Praying and praying<br>
   and no answers. I don't know. That's what I think. You grow up and you just<br>
   got to leave that stuff behind, can’t blame nobody. You just got to all<br>
   take responsibilities. Some people just take responsibility once they've<br>
   done something they cannot regret anymore. It's the way it is. I think it's<br>
   like that everywhere. Not only in the United States, I think it's like that<br>
   everywhere. It's tough. God gotta show up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. No, he's there. He's been there for me a lot. I ain’t going to<br>
   say he don't, because I think God is for everybody, but sometimes we just<br>
   want more I guess. I don't know. He's been there for me. I can't say he<br>
   don't. Like I said they were going to be 10 years the first time, he gave<br>
   me one year, second time they were giving me five, I only did two. I think<br>
   he's been there. My kids, they had that mentality when I was growing up,<br>
   like I said, now they're grown and they're happy. So, I think God is there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: So, what can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants<br>
   reintegrate into Mexican society?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I think what they can do is stop bringing so many people into the<br>
   cities and allow them to work their lands safe. I think that will solve the<br>
   problems in Mexico. Because a lot of the people that come from the towns to<br>
   the cities because of that, because the violence is out there. You get into<br>
   four or five trucks full of people with guns and drunks and drugged up and<br>
   you see that every night, every night, every night and you heard that the<br>
   neighbors, she just got raped and the other one got raped and the other one<br>
   got raped. People start trying to look for protection. I'm thinking if they<br>
   push away people from the city, take them back to their home lands, let<br>
   them work. I’m thinking that will do it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: And what can the United States government do to help Mexican<br>
   deportees and the family that they leave behind?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I don’t know. I don't think there's too much they can do. It's hard<br>
   for them. I'm thinking it's hard for the government also. They can't tell<br>
   what people are feeling they can just tell what they can see. If they see<br>
   people dressing up, acting up, it's like a guy told me, he says, "You look<br>
   like a duck, you quack like a duck, you might be a duck." It's a<br>
   government, they can't say, "Look at the guy's feelings. Take care of his<br>
   feelings." They're not going to do that. They can’t, they're not God. They<br>
   don't know. All they can do is apply the law. It's all they can do. It's<br>
   hard. I don't think problems in the world has to do with governments. I<br>
   think they do, but it has to do more. Have you read the Bible?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yes. Some of it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I'm thinking just God got his own plan. I don't know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: If you would have asked me six months ago, I would've said no, but<br>
   I actually took a class.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: You took a class?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, I’ve read the Bible like I said. I’ve had a lot of experience<br>
   with God. He's been my best friend. I think he's there, he's got his own<br>
   plan, not our plan. He's got his plan.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Well, those were all the questions I had. To wrap this up, I want<br>
   to give you the chance to tell me anything else that you want to add,<br>
   anything that you felt that you may not have gotten across or anything that<br>
   you want to add or clarify or whatever you want to say. Now's the moment to<br>
   do it. Go ahead if you want to.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, like I say, I don't know, maybe you would ask me this questions<br>
   before, when you touch my kids, that's always going to get me. I can't help<br>
   it. Even at the house, even... I got their picture on the wall. Every time<br>
   I walk in the room it's hard. I can't help it, but everything else is just,<br>
   we just have to grow up in this stage. You just have to grow up and you<br>
   just have to make better decisions. There's no way around it. There's just<br>
   that and you can't live your past and the future, or your present. You<br>
   can't live it. You can't live the past in your present, you've got to live<br>
   the present. That's it. I don't know. So many problems in the world, can't<br>
   solve them, so I never really thought about it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I just try my best every day and that's it. There's nothing else I<br>
   can do. I don't think there's nothing else any of us can do, unless you<br>
   can... No, I don't think so. I don’t think even the president can do<br>
   anything. I'm thinking if the president starts giving everybody money,<br>
   everybody's just going to use it on drugs or misuse it or things like that.<br>
   Sometimes money can turn you bad also. I don’t know. Life's hard. It's<br>
   tough. I don't think we got the answers. I don't know. What do you think?<br>
   You think there's an answer?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: No. It's crazy because I think Americans have a very, and everyone<br>
   in gen...<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Continued<br>
 <br>
 <br/><br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I don't know. You just want to help so many people and you want to<br>
   do that as much as you can. And then, there's got to be a point where you<br>
   realize that you can't help everyone.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: That's same mentality I have. Because like I said, I've been with a<br>
   lot of Americans. And I've ate with a lot of Americans in their tables. And<br>
   I've slept with a lot of Americans in their homes. Been in their parties. I<br>
   was going to marry one or two white girls. I mean I've ate any... I don't<br>
   know. Chicken patty. Whatever. Anything. You know what I'm saying? I can't<br>
   think of all the food that I've ate over there. Like a sweet tea, cold tea,<br>
   a chicken fried, whatever. It don't matter. Corn. Whatever. Everything.<br>
   I've ate every kind of meal that you can think of. I've experienced the<br>
   cities, the countries in the States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: And I think there's a lot of good people in the States. Because let's<br>
   say an American comes here to Mexico and does something wrong. Mexicans<br>
   will stone him quick. They will burn him alive in front of everybody and<br>
   have a party. You know what I am saying? And Americans are so, "You did<br>
   something wrong, but I'm not going to take it. Apply the law." You see what<br>
   I'm saying? So to me, that's why I say I'm American because I've lived for<br>
   the Americans. Not because of the government, because I've lived for the<br>
   Americans. Because I know how my people are, black people are, people that<br>
   are in between and they're born in the States. I mean just living in the<br>
   States, you're going to find people that are bad everywhere in the world.<br>
   But I've definitely found more bad people here in Mexico in a month that<br>
   I've found in the States all the time I lived there. So to me States is<br>
   nice. United States is right. It's good. If there'll be a war, I'll go<br>
   fight for United States.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: You can enlist.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Enlist in the-<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Even if it's against Mexico, you're going.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Even if it's against Mexicans, let's go.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: No. It's crazy because I feel like I came into this project...<br>
   This is the second year that I've been doing it. And I came in thinking<br>
   like, "Oh. Then people must hate the United States." And I was so blown<br>
   away by the fact that people don't. People even if they've gotten deported<br>
   are still so grateful to all of the experiences that they had and the<br>
   people that they met.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. Like I said, here in Mexico, I mean, when we first got here,<br>
   they used to call us gabachos. They'll be like, "Gabachos.." Big, old,<br>
   huge. They're everywhere. Why? Because we will speak English. Because we<br>
   didn't like their jokes. Because we looked like them. Because we don't act<br>
   like them. It got to the point where they're like, "Okay. So gabachos.<br>
   Their not scared. They'll fight." So we get our respects, but we still<br>
   don't know how to mingle. Because to this day, I've meet a lot of people<br>
   that are born here and they're on their own. They don't mingle. They'll say<br>
   what's up to somebody, but you're not going to hear them having a<br>
   conversation with somebody because they cannot mingle. I don't think if<br>
   we're going to be able to mingle. Then we're going to get old and we're not<br>
   going to mingle. I don't know.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: But I see a lot of people that stays here. They can't mingle. They<br>
   can't. They just get along with people that have the same history. But with<br>
   Mexicans, they can't mingle. I don't know why. I don't think they'll<br>
   ever... It was like when you tasted heaven. You're never going to forget<br>
   heaven. And you still want to go to heaven.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: The United States is heaven?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: This is heaven. I'm talking about everything. Fruit, meat. I mean<br>
   everything. Even Burger King don't taste the same here in Mexico. You go to<br>
   a Pizza Hut. They take the cheese. They take the bacon. They take the<br>
   pepperoni. You know what I'm saying? I mean you go to get one pizza and it<br>
   have 10 slices of pepperoni. Next one has only got five. You get it out of<br>
   there and the cheese is already wrinkling altogether because the pizza<br>
   don't have enough cheese. I mean you see these in Mexico all the time.<br>
   Nothing tastes the same. Burger King doesn't taste the same. McDonald's<br>
   don't taste the same. Close enough, but you're always remembering. You're<br>
   always remembering.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: What's your favorite American food?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: My favorite American food had to be barbecue chicken. Had to be.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Interesting.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: And chili cheese's okay. But barbecue chicken. And now, not just<br>
   anybody. Like I said, I've been with a lot of people and some people don't<br>
   know how to cook. And then, some people just wow. Some people just got a...<br>
   Thanksgiving. Wow. I mean I don't think you could find somebody in Mexico<br>
   that knows how to cook sweet ham. I don't think you could find one. I don't<br>
   think you could find somebody in Mexico know how to make some chili beans.<br>
   I don't think you can find one. It's a lot of things. Sweet tea. I mean<br>
   there's so many things that you're not going to find in Mexico. Like I<br>
   never ate so many guisados in my life, because I also was used to eating<br>
   other food. To this day I miss it.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: My wife, when I first got here, she always be mad. She hates<br>
   Americans. She hates when I speak English. She hates a lot of things. And<br>
   we will go out. She'll be like, "Hey. Let's go get some chicken nuggets."<br>
   This is funny, right? So we went to buy some chicken nuggets and she<br>
   started heating up the tortillas. I'm like, "What are you doing?" She's<br>
   like, "Heating up some tortillas." I'm like, "Why?." So they said, "We can<br>
   eat the..." I'm like, "No. You eat this with ketchup." And she's like, "You<br>
   crazy. You and your American life. And you're in Mexico now." And starts<br>
   talking shit. And she sees me eating and she'll dip it. Okay.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Now next week she's asking for the chicken nuggets. You see what I'm<br>
   saying? Same thing with a lot of things. With pizza, man. It's like the<br>
   first two, three pieces she's fighting and she's arguing. She's debating.<br>
   She's just talking, "I don't want it." You know what? She gets her first<br>
   bite. Next thing you know, she wants a slice. Next thing she's just asking<br>
   for pizza. Next thing you know, she wants pizza every week. It's like I'm<br>
   telling you. Once you start enjoying the good things in life or whatever,<br>
   you start experiencing all those things. You're never going to want to go<br>
   back. You're always want to keep living the life you're living. So it's<br>
   good to be poor. But once they get you out of poor, you don't want to ever<br>
   be poor again.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: It's tough.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Especially when the world is so against you. Like we were saying<br>
   before we began.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. I'm telling you it's like... I remember when I first got here,<br>
   I hear people be like, "They make a hundred and some pesos a day. They make<br>
   800 pesos a week." That is $40. I mean and you walk anywhere. You walk here<br>
   everything is just the same price as in America. So nothing's cheaper. So<br>
   you can afford it. And you're like, "How is your government adding these<br>
   things up? I don't get it." But it's like that. And nothing changes. And<br>
   when they give them a raise, they give them seven pesos raise. You know<br>
   what I'm saying? It's like, "Oh my God. Why don't people start a fucking<br>
   war or something? I don't get it." But people learn to mingle and they<br>
   learn to live this way. And they will call beans frijolitos. They give all<br>
   this extra word at the end so it could just sound better.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: But anyways when I first got here, I couldn't mingle with that. And<br>
   I'd be like, "Man. Why are these people just.... They're mad, man." So I<br>
   started enjoying them. And I started eating their food and I started<br>
   realizing that, "Well, it's okay. They got seasoning. They got taste." So<br>
   all of that counts when you're eating pork. But at one point another, my<br>
   mind tells me, "Yes. It's okay to eat beans and rice every other day. But<br>
   not every day." You, know? I want some meat, man. I want some chicken. I<br>
   want some beef. I want some pork. I want to go to Burger King. I want to go<br>
   bowling. If I'm bored, I don't want to just kick it outside my house. And I<br>
   go spend some money. I want to go take my kids shopping, get some stuff,<br>
   eat some things, try something else. Take them something. Money won't let<br>
   you. It won't let you. You need money. And it's not letting you.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: But that's how it is. That's how it is for a lot of people. Thank God<br>
   to me it’s not that way. The last couple of years. Thank God to me, I've<br>
   struggled. Like I said, he's always helped me out. He's always helped me<br>
   out. I've never been like the kind of person that, "Okay. You give me a<br>
   hundred dollars. It's okay. I want 400." I've never been that way. It's<br>
   like if I'm making a hundred, I want to make 200 next time. If I make 200,<br>
   I will make 300 next time. And it's never enough. And if I could fill up a<br>
   whole bank of my money and I'm not going to use it. That's good with me. I<br>
   don't want it, but let's fill it up. Let's keep it there. And a lot of<br>
   people are not like that. A lot of people are just like, "Okay. I'm good<br>
   with 500 pesos." I don't know. But this is where we live. This is we had to<br>
   live in.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: So what do you think? That's enough? How long we been here?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: I don't know. What do you think? We've been here over [crosstalk<br>
   00:08:58].<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, there's a lot of more stories. No. I think it's enough. Because<br>
   I got to go back.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Mm-hmm (affirmative).<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Yeah. I think it's enough.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Are you satisfied with what you said?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: Well, yeah. Like I said, I don't think there'll be enough time.<br>
   There's so many stories. So many things I've seen. But sometimes when you<br>
   think about them, you can't recall them.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Claudia: Yeah. That's true. No. I think this has been perfect. I think it's<br>
   been very, very good.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Daniel: I hope so.<br>
