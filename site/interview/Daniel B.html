I know that sometimes talking about these</br>   things and sharing these stories can be a little painful and bring about</br>   emotions that you don't really want to feel or relive, but it's important</br>   to know your story and to really help people understand the realities of</br>   migration and the human side of it. I think that this is really awesome</br>   that you've been talking to us and telling us this because it's really</br>   going to be helpful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, it's my pleasure, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>. [inaudible 00:00:39] is a lot better</br>   now. If I were to come and maybe tell you my story <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about three, four years   ago</span> I probably wouldn't have been able to. Right now, emotions, they’re not</br>   mixed anymore. I pretty much know what's going on, know where I stand and</br>   know my options. Once you got all that stuff cleared out, your story just</br>   becomes a story and not a feeling anymore. My story is like, I'm pretty</br>   sure more like any young guy that was born in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> without a... Well,</br>   even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 90s</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the 90s</span> I think it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the toughest year</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span> when it comes down to gang members.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: When I was young, living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Illinois</span>, nothing but gang members all</br>   around, people getting shot all the time, people getting beat up all the</br>   time so that's how it was when he was young. When I realized that's not the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> life I... That even though to me wasn't as bad as the world seemed like</br>   it is. It was still not legal. It was still against the law. When you're a</br>   gang member, you can't look left, you can't look right, you can't say this.</br>   You can’t be mad. They block you from all kinds of emotions. The only</br>   emotion for you to have with the law, it's you want to change and you're</br>   going to do right and be a right citizen. Sometimes you're just young and</br>   you don't know what you're doing. You just don't realize it till you grow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Unfortunately, I didn't realize it till I was here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I got</br>   here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> kids over there in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span> when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. By the</br>   time I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>, people tried to kill me about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> times by the time</br>   I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>. Plenty of my cousins got shot, plenty of my friends got killed</br>   right in front of me, across the street. All this stuff is basically all I</br>   lived till I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: You were born in the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I was born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You were born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and so why did your family leave?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, we left because my mom was a single mom and my dad, I don't</br>   know, he had residential at that time, I think. I don't know how he works,</br>   but he would come to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, work for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span> and back and</br>   forth. He's done this since before we were born. He's still doing it now. I</br>   don't know if he became a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen. I know he was arrested and I don't</br>   know if he ever became a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen. At one point my mom would just take</br>   care of my grandparents, well, my dad's parents. At one point she just got</br>   tired of it and decided to go to the States and she took us to the States</br>   without following my dad. She went to the States but not to follow my dad</br>   to look for work.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: And then she saved some money and then she took us to the States</br>   after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> that she was saving money, then she took us to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>.</br>   That's how we got there. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> of us, the youngest <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span>, I</br>   think it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one or two years old</span>. I can't recall. I was the oldest one, I</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven, eight</span>. Something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you remember <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">your first day</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: In the States? Well, no. I have a lot of memories about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>,</br>   but not my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> day. To this day, I remember the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I crossed on</br>   the bus, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eight</span> like I said, that I remember. Then at the</br>   State I remember the school I got to, I think it was _____ School. I</br>   remember the school, the kids and stuff like that, but not specific dates.</br>   No.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Is there any teacher or friend or someone from school that you</br>   remember?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: No, not really. When I was in school, I wasn't too friendly. When I</br>   first started being friendly, that's when I started knowing gang members.</br>   Before that I was like, people didn't like me, things like that. I was the</br>   shortest one, the little one, the ugly one or things like that until I</br>   became friends, started making friends and it started really with girl</br>   friends. I started being friends with girls that were gang members and</br>   that's how it started. To me it was like, &quot;I'm bored all the time and now</br>   I'm having fun with guys and girls up and down.&quot; <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> thing led to another.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Tell me more about involvement in gangs and that sort of thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, I never really liked the idea of gangs, it was more like</br>   something mandatory for any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Hispanic</span>, even white people and black kids were</br>   trying to be gang members with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. But <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> were like...</br>   Everybody knows <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> are violent and they like to fight. They don't</br>   take no for answers, it's here and everywhere. It was like that. Most of</br>   the gang members who I met, like I said, it was for fun. It was always for</br>   fun until things started getting serious and when things started getting</br>   serious, I did not like it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I recall becoming a gang member, I've always hang</br>   around gang members all my life, but when I had just turned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>, I got</br>   kicked out of some school in ___________, which I know a lot of gang</br>   members there, but I wouldn't affiliate with them. I just knew them. I just</br>   dressed like them, looked like them, act like them, but that was it. I</br>   would still go home from home to school. When I came back to _____, because</br>   I went to _______, came back to ____ when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">13</span>, I came back with the</br>   friends I grew up with before I went to ______ and all the friends that I</br>   grew up with now, they were all gang members from the same gang.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I just showed up to a house and they're all just getting drugged up,</br>   doing paint, and I don't know what kind of other drugs they were doing. I</br>   got there and they took me to their crew and when I got to the crew, there</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">20</span> people there, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">half</span> of the people they know me. The person that took</br>   me there was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my cousins. I got there to the crew and I started</br>   realizing, I know a lot of guys there, are guys that I grew up with.</br>   Anyway, I walked to the crew and this guy runs up to me with a knife. He's</br>   like, &quot;You don't belong here, ..you're stupid.&quot; I heard some other guy</br>   scream out, &quot;Hey, that's my boy, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>. Nobody touches <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>.&quot; I looked up</br>   and I'm like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Johnny</span>.&quot; His name was <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Johnny</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I'm like, &quot;What's up, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Johnny</span>, what are you doing here?&quot; He's like, &quot;I</br>   don't know man, you know what I’m saying?&quot; I'm like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</br>   He's like, &quot;This and that.&quot; I’m like, &quot;Man, you sound dumb. What are you</br>   talking about? What are you doing? Look at you.&quot; And he's like, &quot;No, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>,</br>   life has changed, blah blah blah.&quot; I'm like, &quot;I don't know what you're</br>   talking about, man. I dress like you, I look like you, but I don't get</br>   you.&quot; He’s like, &quot;No, this and that. You want to click it?&quot; I’m like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, I’ll click in.&quot; Like nothing. I clicked in. The next thing I know,</br>   I'm with them up and down.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I realized what kind of life they're having, which was nothing but</br>   drugs, getting in fights, getting locked up, being rebels to their family,</br>   to their mom. You don't say, everybody's like this and I disagreed. I would</br>   always disagree. I always tell them, &quot;You're wrong and you could do better.</br>   Hey, don't do that.&quot; They didn't like that. They wouldn't like me giving</br>   them the contradictory all the time. They wanted people to be around...You</br>   know what I'm saying? And I would be like, &quot;I'm not scared, I’ll fight you,</br>   I’ll fight you, I'll fight them, I'll fight whoever, it don't matter, but I</br>   just don't like your mentality. It's just dead. I don't see it. I don't see</br>   the purpose.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I got fed up with them and like I said, they were always getting in</br>   jail, always getting in trouble and it was just not something I agree with.</br>   I got fed up with them and I'm like, &quot;Hey, you know what? I don’t like your</br>   game.&quot; They're like, &quot;What do you mean, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>? Why are you always saying</br>   this dumb things?&quot; And I'll be like, &quot;It's just that I'm tired of you guys.</br>   All you guys do is talk about the same thing. You don't ever have a</br>   different conversation. I don't see a future in what you're doing. I don't</br>   care what is your reason, I just don't see it. I don't get you, man.</br>   Because I recalled you when I knew you before, you're not the same guy. I</br>   don't want to be part of your game.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: He said, &quot;Well, you've been talking too much, I’m going to put you in</br>   the group and we're going to beat your head.&quot; I’m like, &quot;Bring it, man. No,</br>   get me out of here. I told you I don't like your life.&quot; They put me in a</br>   group of about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">20</span> guys, started beating me up. Well, anyways, I thought all</br>   that was funny. To me, I would just keep thinking, &quot;Well, I'm not going to</br>   be like you. I don't care how many times you beat me; I still don't want to</br>   be like you.&quot; I started doing that, I do not want beef, so they started</br>   beating me up. The leader at the time was... What was his name? <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Dofo</span>,</br>   Alonzo, I can’t remember anything. Anyways, he's like, &quot;No, once you're a</br>   gang member you’re a gang member for life, blah blah blah.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I’m just laughing at him. He pulls off a knife at me and comes</br>   towards my stomach. When he did this, the people that knew me when we were</br>   young for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">one second</span>, they knew, they understood me for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">one sec</span> and they</br>   jumped. Everybody's jumping, &quot;No, nobody touches him. Anybody touches <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>,</br>   the gang is over right now and we will kill each other right now if you</br>   touch <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>.&quot; Everybody started jumping. &quot;Yeah, I'm with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span> and I'm with</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>.&quot; I'm getting kicked out of the clique and the group is... I don't</br>   know what they did, they got a bond that second and I think that is the</br>   memory why I came back to be their friend.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Not because I wanted to be in the gang, because for the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I</br>   was like, &quot;Man, these people got my back.&quot; Even though I turned my back</br>   against them, they still have my back. That's what it was like. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Next day</span> we</br>   showed up to school and I will see all my friends be like, &quot;No <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>, we</br>   can't give you the handshake anymore blah blah.&quot; It got to me, it hit me</br>   and I was like, &quot;You know what I can’t be without you guys can I just click</br>   back in?&quot; They clicked me back in the next day in school. Then after that,</br>   I never changed. I still told the all the gang members I've built all my</br>   life because all I did was gang members over there. Even to this day I have</br>   to deal with it here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: If you could ________, &quot;Who are the gang members?&quot; It’s big time.</br>   Half of them have killed somebody. I'm still dealing with this all the</br>   time, except that when I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, to me, it was a new beginning,</br>   a new beginning that I couldn't find in the States because no matter where</br>   I went in the State, it was the same thing. No matter how bad I wanted to</br>   say, &quot;This is not the life I want.&quot; It was the life that I had and there</br>   was no way around it. Then you meet some people that don't accept a no for</br>   an answer and they're violent and it becomes not only you, your family,</br>   your kids. It becomes a big thing. Not only you have the gang members as</br>   your enemies, you have the cops as your enemies. It becomes a big, big</br>   mess.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>. When I started working</br>   here at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teletech</span> I’m like the ripe gang member for everybody at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teletech</span>. I</br>   had tattoos in my neck, I covered them up, on my hands, everywhere. It was</br>   a big beef, and I was like, &quot;You know what? I don't care about this. The</br>   only reason...&quot; That's the only reason I never came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span> because I</br>   knew about how <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span> was. That would be the main reason why I never came</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>, or I would never get involved in people coming from the</br>   States. I would get involved in people in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, the works in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, the</br>   way <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> live. I would never want to come here. It got to the point</br>   where we're dealing so much the jobs in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> but they weren't making the</br>   cut.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: They weren't doing it, I was stressing, I was struggling, I was</br>   getting all messed up. I decided, I'm like, &quot;It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five years</span> and I</br>   haven't liked one thing about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> except that I'm married, I got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span></br>   kids now.&quot; <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> kid and the other one is my wife. And I was like, &quot;Well, I'm</br>   going to try Teletech.&quot; How am I going? How am I getting a flight? I was</br>   like, &quot;I know I'm just block in there and I'm going to get in a fight. I</br>   don't even know why I'm going.&quot; I showed up anyways and when I showed up, I</br>   don't know if it was God or what it was, I got along with everybody even</br>   though they knew who I was.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: There was a lot of problems sometimes it was catching you up in the</br>   bathroom, catching you around the corner, pulling out knives around the</br>   building, telling you you're this, you're that. At the same time, I had</br>   guys from their end that got to know me and they were willing to get in</br>   between those issues. I worked with <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Teletech</span> for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a year</span> having these</br>   conflictions and then I got fired and I decided to clear my tattoos. That's</br>   when I put tattoos over my tattoos and came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teletech</span> and from then</br>   I have not had a gang problem. Probably since I was a little kid, the only</br>   time I didn't have to worry about gangs was since I covered my tattoos for</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a year</span>, year and a half. And it's never been my choice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: It's never been something I wanted. At one time, the one time that I</br>   was by my own friends over there, they tried to beat me so many times, they</br>   pulled knives on me so many times, here. No, not here in the States.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: In the States.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Right here, it was something like that, but it never got to that</br>   point, and it will be always because of the same reasons. I would never</br>   understand them. Even though I would stay with them, I would still always</br>   not understand them. I'll always be like, &quot;You're doing wrong guy. You're</br>   doing wrong, you shouldn't be doing that. Why are you doing? Get a job.</br>   Fucking lazy ass.&quot; Things like that. I'd be like, &quot;Get your ass up, man.</br>   Stop fucking crying. If you don't want this life, do something about it.&quot;</br>   Cops will come around, they want to run and I be like, &quot;Why are you</br>   running? Talk to the guy, say what's up. Why are you running? Because the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> thing you do when you run, is they’re going to run after you. Come</br>   on.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I always do that. Well, I never had a real chance to bond with cops</br>   till I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. When I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, I bought a birth certificate</br>   and a social security from another guy. I walk at the police station and I</br>   became that guy. When I became that guy, I no longer had to worry about the</br>   law because now I'm legal. I got to bond with the law and I got to made a</br>   lot of friends with police officers. That's the only reason why probably</br>   I'm not still in prison. Once I got to bond with them, it was different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Okay, got you. Tell me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, did you ever partake in any of the</br>   gang activities whatever, that sort of thing, and fighting?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yes, of course. Of course. All the time. This is the thing, when it</br>   would be something like that, I would always... I made a lot of enemies, my</br>   friends a lot because I think when two guys fight, they talk a</br>   conversation, even though they don't say anything. At the end of the fight,</br>   usually there's talking, nice talk and a lot of them became my friends, a</br>   lot of them after a fight, after whatever and say whatever, meet again. I</br>   had a lot of friends that were my enemies, a lot and through conflicts we</br>   became friends with a lot of them. That was always because I think it was</br>   because the mentality that I had, like I said, I never agreed with it. It</br>   was life. It is how it is, couldn't do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I've seen a lot of fights. They used to make groups that sometimes</br>   whenever it would get to me, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my friends would get hurt. Then you</br>   would feel like you have to do something about it. There'll be times where</br>   you will have to just go do something, fight people or whatever. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> time,</br>   we would go look for people, for crews, you would find crews over there, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">20</span></br>   people, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">30</span> gang members in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> spot. They will go a lot to dance floors and</br>   things like that. We would go there, groups together, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">30</span> of us. We'd go on</br>   cars back to back. We get there. Once we would get there, I used to love</br>   the fighting.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I'd be like, &quot;Yeah, fight him. Let him know you're better than him.</br>   Fight him. That's it. Fight him. That's it. Just fight him. Let him get up.</br>   Let him know that you beat him. That's it.&quot; But they wouldn't do this. They</br>   would want to crash them, destroy them, leave them dead on the floor and</br>   things like that. Cracked head opens, people shaking, tweaking, things like</br>   that. Every time I would notice something like that, I will never agree.</br>   One time we went to the dance floor and saw some guys, we would send in</br>   bait. We would send one guy into the dance floor representing his colors to</br>   start up something and they will chase them out of course, but you will</br>   walk out thinking you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10</span> and we're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">30</span> outside waiting on you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: You see what I'm saying? We would do that, and they started doing</br>   this. I would go with them, at first it was fun. Like I said, when it was</br>   just regular fights, it was fun, but when they started bringing guns, bats</br>   and things like that, I would just think it was too much. They come out,</br>   they didn't know we're waiting for them. As soon as they notice we're</br>   waiting for them they started running everywhere. They caught up one guy,</br>   he tried to jump over a fence, they caught him up, dragged him down, and</br>   they started hitting him bad with bats on the head, crashing on, destroying</br>   him. I was just watching and they wanted me to hit him so I wouldn't do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I’m like, &quot;Why would I hit him? He's taken already, man. What are you</br>   doing hitting him with a bat on his head while he's unconscious? Come on,</br>   what do you want?&quot; Anyway, he's like, &quot;No, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>, you always been this way</br>   and this ain't your life. I don't know what you do with us, blah blah</br>   blah.&quot; When this happened, his wife comes running, the guy looks like he's</br>   dead. Comes running and she's like, &quot;No, leave him alone. Blah blah.&quot; She's</br>   crying. I notice she's pregnant. She had a big belly and the guy that I was</br>   arguing with already wanted to hit her with a bat. I'm like, &quot;Hey, if you</br>   hit her with a bat, I'm hitting you with a bat” and everybody surround me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: All the guys are like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>, why are you always like that, man? You</br>   need to calm down. This is the life we live in.&quot; And I'd be like, &quot;No, I'm</br>   not going to agree with that, man. I can't agree with that. I cannot agree</br>   with it.&quot; I said,&quot; If you hit her, I'm hitting you.&quot; They didn't hit her,</br>   they left her alone and we moved on. I didn't let the guys do that to her.</br>   Everybody, it don't matter is what gang you’re around being with in the</br>   States, they know who I am. They know that I will say no to the majority of</br>   the things they do. They know me for these things. But yeah, that's one of</br>   the things I've seen over there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: The story that has to do with the police officer, is it in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   or in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, everything had to be over there before I got deported. Right</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I've never really dealt with the law. Like I said, when I</br>   got here, it was like a new beginning for me. To me it was like a new</br>   beginning, different decisions, people didn't know me.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Alright. I guess tell me the story about the police officer and</br>   also just leading up to how you got back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time that I got back here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it was, the</br>   police officer had just pulled me over. Well, he pulled <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> guys</br>   over. The reason why he pulled us over is probably because they were gang</br>   members also. I didn't know the police officer. I think they knew him. He</br>   pulled us over and he wanted to search the car and I wouldn't let him. I</br>   told him, &quot;No, you're not going to search the car.&quot; And he didn't search</br>   the car. Well, he pulls him over again <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a week later</span> and tells me that, &quot;I</br>   know who you are. You're illegal. I'm just waiting for you to turn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span> and I</br>   deport you.&quot; He did that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: When I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>, on my birthday, he went and picked me up at my house</br>   with order of arrest and he deported me. That's how that happened. He put</br>   me in a prison, well, not a prison in a cell of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">30</span> guys and most of them</br>   had already done something. A couple of them would tell you stories where</br>   they stabbed so many people, blah, blah, people without teeth all tatted</br>   up. Just people that you can tell they lived it big time and I was the</br>   youngest one in there. The cop, I think he did that on purpose. He scared</br>   me, I signed the paper and that's how I came over. If I would’ve fought</br>   that at that time, well, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen by culture. I didn't know that at</br>   the time. If I had known, I would have fought it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I didn't, I signed and I came here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. That was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time</br>   I got deported. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time I got deported, well, I got here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>,</br>   I turned around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen and I'm back over there in the States, within <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a   week</span> after I got deported. That's when I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>. When I got to</br>   Georgia, same thing. I'm bald headed, tatts, the way I walk, the way I</br>   dress, all them things. I started working again like I've always worked.</br>   I've always worked, I never not worked since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>, I've never not</br>   worked, I always worked. I was working, at that time, I was a machine</br>   operator for _____ products in ____, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, anyways at that time I had to stay over <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">late at night</span>, we had</br>   to fix some things with the machine so I stayed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">late at night</span> and I didn't</br>   live too far from there, so I decided to walk home. The way I was walking</br>   home, I seen a white girl, regular white girl, and she's like, &quot;Hey, you,</br>   you're so cute. Blah blah.&quot; She starts talking to me so I start talking to</br>   her and we're just chilling there talking. Next thing you know, I got cops</br>   everywhere. Pom pom pom. Cops everywhere. &quot;Hit the floor.&quot; And I'm like,</br>   &quot;I'm not going to the floor.&quot; They’re like, &quot;You better go to the floor.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;I'm not going to the floor. If you want to arrest me, you better</br>   walk over and put the handcuffs on me because I'm not going to the floor.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: They walked over, they arrested me, they took me to jail and the girl</br>   walked off. She just walked off. Anyways, I get there and the sheriff tells</br>   me, he says, &quot;Well, you know why I arrested you?&quot; And I'm like, &quot;No.&quot; He</br>   says, &quot;The girl you were with is my niece.&quot; I like, &quot;I didn't know, I just</br>   met her right now. I've just seen her.&quot; He's like, &quot;Well that's my niece,</br>   and I just wanted to let you know. Don't bring that bullshit about me being</br>   racist, blah, blah, blah.&quot; He says, &quot;Because I'm not.&quot; He wasn't and he</br>   said, &quot;But that was my niece and I don't like the way you look.&quot; He said,</br>   &quot;If I cannot find something wrong with you right now, you will be released</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">48 hours</span>.&quot; And I was a smart aleck, I was like, &quot;Well, you got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">72 hours</span></br>   according to the law.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I was a smart aleck. He's like, &quot;Well, yeah. You're right. I got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">72   </span>hours.&quot; He said. I was just smart. He said, &quot;Well, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">72 hours</span>....&quot; He</br>   says, &quot;If I cannot find something wrong with you, I'm going to release you.</br>   But if I can, I guarantee you I'm not going to release you.&quot; <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">72 hours</span>, they</br>   realized that I had just got deported <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple months</span> before that and they</br>   deported me again. That was my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> deportation. That deportation, well,</br>   I did the same thing. I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I turned around and I'm back in</br>   Georgia, but in ____, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, no longer in ____. That's when my mom told</br>   me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: She's like, &quot;Well, why don't you do the same thing everybody's doing?</br>   Go buy you a birth certificate, a social security card, walk into the</br>   police station and that's it.&quot; That's what I did. From then, from when I</br>   was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span> till I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">27</span>, in the eyes of the law, I was legal. Even though in</br>   Georgia I was always fighting, I was always doing things like this, I got a</br>   bond with the cops. Even though I was always fighting, to me, it was always</br>   just fights, nothing else. I was always getting involved in the pool</br>   tournaments, bowling tournaments, basketball tournaments, whatever,</br>   everything I could be involved with. Since it was the town, it was nothing</br>   like ____ all the cops were like [snaps], they knew everything right away.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: They knew you, they knew about your family right away. They started</br>   like, I was always in the... people call me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Capo</span> over there. People's</br>   always in their mouth. It was new to them. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> being everywhere. It</br>   was new to them. It was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span> country, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Ku Klux Klan</span>, it was different,</br>   you know what I'm saying? It wasn't as common for them to have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> not</br>   being scared. It was weird for them. I passed that by, for around, and</br>   people stopped being scared. People would just be calm and around people be</br>   everywhere. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> everywhere, white girls with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> everywhere. I</br>   got to bond with everybody. I was always cool with all the cops. Every time</br>   I get in a fight, they let me go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Every time I was drunk, they let me go. They'd just be like, &quot;It's</br>   you again <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Dan</span>...&quot; They called me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Robert</span>, because I bought ID for somebody</br>   else. &quot;It's you again, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Robert</span>.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, whatever.&quot; And they'd be</br>   like, &quot;Hey, go home.&quot; They never locked me up, never. I got into a lot of</br>   the fights. They would never lock me up, they always let me go. The time</br>   they locked me up, it was because like I said, I had a license, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">that night</span></br>   I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Walmart</span> and I didn't bring my license with me and I got pulled</br>   over by a cop I didn't know. This was the highway patrol. I knew everybody,</br>   all the cops there. I got confident. I knew they weren't going to take me</br>   to jail.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I went into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Walmart</span> and for reasons got lucky, the highway patrol was</br>   passing by, he pulls me over, he didn’t know me, takes me to jail. They</br>   fingerprint me and they identify that I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> people. Even though the cop</br>   there, that took me in. He's like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Robert</span>.&quot; I'm like, &quot;What?&quot; He says,</br>   &quot;You're not <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Robert</span>.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why do you say that?&quot; He says, &quot;You’re</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>, you're <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Danielel</span>.&quot; I’m like, Yeah. What are you going to do?&quot; He says,</br>   &quot;Look, I know you for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">a minute</span> already.&quot; He says, &quot;I like you a lot, I’m</br>   going to let you go. Get your stuff, go home.&quot; He said, &quot;But you're already</br>   in the system.&quot; He says, &quot;The way the system works now, federal will get</br>   involved in double identities. There's nothing I could do.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: He says, &quot;You got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">30 days</span> to leave <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span> or at least move somewhere</br>   else, because now they're going to come get you.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; I was</br>   going to move. I packed up my expedition, we put the U-<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Haul</span> at the back,</br>   boom, we're moving. On the way, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">U</span>-<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Haul</span> started weaving, started taking</br>   me off the road. So we turned back around. We came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span> and when</br>   we got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, my mom's house had got flooded. When we got there, her</br>   whole trailer was flooded. Since it was wood, sheet rock, everything was</br>   just damaged. The floor, the walls, everything was damaged. I was like,</br>   “That's my work. That's what I do.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I was like, &quot;Okay, you know what? I'm just trying to fix your house</br>   before I leave.&quot; I started off in the bathroom, we're talking about the</br>   whole trailer got flooded, everything. Everything was damaged. I started</br>   off with the bathroom, it took me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about three weeks</span> to get her house all</br>   taken care of. When I was about to get done, I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two or three days</span></br>   from getting done, that's when the cops came over. That's when the federal</br>   showed up to my house. They showed up to my house, hitting the door,</br>   pointing guns, blah, blah, they’re on the trees, in the bushes, everywhere,</br>   they’re everywhere.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's when actually everything got serious because that's when they</br>   gave me a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> felony reentry and the federal tried to give me my identity</br>   theft, and they tried to put me a [inaudible 00:27:55]. When I got locked</br>   up at that time, I acknowledged the system, how it worked, and I wouldn't</br>   go buy it because my brother had just got locked up and just because he was</br>   a gang member, he got locked in, he was doing <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14 months</span>, he ended up doing</br>   eight years. I was like, &quot;Well, I'm not going to fall for that.&quot; I told</br>   them, I was like, &quot;No. I'm not a gang member.&quot; He's like, &quot;You're</br>   everywhere. I see your tatts, your record.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah, in your</br>   mind, in your system, but I'm not going to fall for it.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: What they did is, since I wouldn't sign all those papers, it worked</br>   on my behalf, all that stuff helped me out. Since I already knew all the</br>   cops in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, in ____, like I said, I knew lawyers, I knew judges, I</br>   knew a lot of people and they were like real friends. I even had cops that</br>   would go to my house, chill with me, drink a beer, just be there with their</br>   car, me and my kids for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">half an hour</span>, we'll see each other at the laundry,</br>   bowling alley, playing pool. I know many cops personally. They sent a</br>   lawyer to try to help me out with this case, and the lawyer got there and</br>   he... I remember him to this day. With glasses, he had his hair all nappy,</br>   like a redneck, regular redneck.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: He gets there and he's like, &quot;<span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Danielel</span>, I can't believe they got me out</br>   of the bed because of a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>.&quot; But I've only always understood the humor</br>   because whenever they call me <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Wetback</span>, I would call him <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Cracker</span>. Not a big</br>   deal. It's like... Anyway, this was normal for me. He got there, I'm like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, what did they send you here for?&quot; He's like, &quot;Well, I'm surprised</br>   because everybody in _____, they're forcing me, they got me out of my bed</br>   to force me to fight your case because they do not want to see you in</br>   prison. It's just a surprise to me that you're <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> and I'm doing this.&quot;</br>   Anyways, he did. He fought the case, he beat the case.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I recall this day when I was in front of the judge, he's like, &quot;Are</br>   you guilty or not guilty?&quot; I'm like, &quot;I'm guilty.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Shut</br>   up.&quot; He looks at him and he's like, &quot;Your honor...&quot; He says, &quot;...forgive</br>   this man. He don't know what he's talking about.&quot; He fought the case and he</br>   beat the case. He won the favor of the judge. They dropped the identity</br>   theft and only left me with a felony <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> reentry. I only did <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> for</br>   that and then I came to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. It was the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I was actually in</br>   Mexico, literally in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">27</span> and I didn't like it at all. I hate</br>   it. It was something horrible. I remember when I was in the plane, all the</br>   other times I knew it was going to turn around, but this time I did prison</br>   time already.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: This time I know I got lucky, this time I understood the law now.</br>   This time I stayed without kids. In order for me to stop dreaming about my</br>   kids, it took me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about three years</span> to stop dreaming about them. It was</br>   pretty tough. I'm at the plane and I'm looking at this, I'm looking,</br>   leaving the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> and I'm seeing where I'm going. When at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, it was</br>   real, when I started noticing this and I'm like, &quot;I can't believe I'm going</br>   to stay here. I can't believe I'm going to stay.&quot; If I would've had</br>   somebody there to tell me to turn around <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">that second</span>, I would have done it</br>   again, but I didn't, I couldn't find nobody. I was just stressful. I was</br>   crying to myself, nobody was watching me, with my head bowed down.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I was at the bus station and I was like, &quot;I can't believe I'm doing</br>   this. I can't believe I'm here. I can't believe this.&quot; I couldn't believe</br>   it. Just with my head bowed down like this, and I started hearing birds. I</br>   started feeling something calming me down. I’m like, &quot;What's calming me</br>   down?&quot; Something calm me down. I started paying attention to my surrounding</br>   and I started acknowledging that it was birds. It was birds singing</br>   everywhere. I was like, &quot; I never listened to this in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>.</br>   Okay, I’m going to calm down.&quot; I calm down, made my decision, got my bus</br>   ticket and boom, I came from the borderline to _______.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I'm telling you, at that time, I wasn’t even actually making good</br>   money in that time because I was working in a job in ______ and I was</br>   making like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">4,000</span> a week, which wasn’t good, pesos, like $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200</span>, but it was</br>   more than enough for me at the time. I was sending my kids money in the</br>   States for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the whole year of 2009</span>, a little bit of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2010</span>. All the money that</br>   I was making here, which was a little bit, I was able to send <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">150</span>, every</br>   two weeks and things like that. It wasn’t a lot, but I was doing that</br>   because it was all right. Anyways, once that [place] shut down,</br>   everything... It was real hard. The family members that I got here, I</br>   started knowing who they were, I started disliking them and things like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I started recalling when they would go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> and I</br>   would help them out and when I got here, they were just not... I didn't</br>   like them at all, a lot. These people were people that just see you down so</br>   they can laugh at you, trick you into... They have this thing, “no transa,</br>   no avanza” which means the one that don't gets the other guys, not every...</br>   It's weird. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> here are weird. I started disliking these people. I</br>   started being away from their lifestyle. I started being more... Felt more</br>   lonely through the time, not having people here, not being able to bond,</br>   not understand their jokes, not liking their culture, the way they are. The</br>   culture is what they live before the history. Yeah, that's nice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: The colors, they're artists, well, that's pretty, got beautiful</br>   sites. But the people themselves, it's like when I got to construction, I</br>   can be really good at basically all kinds of construction, machinery work,</br>   anything. They will see your talent and they will try to pull you down</br>   fast. Here, it's like you kiss butt, you can get up there. Even women,</br>   women are laying with all the supervisors here where they go, guys are</br>   kissing butt everywhere they go, anything the boss man says is funny and</br>   I'm not used to these things. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> we're a little more</br>   separate from each other. We could be quiet <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">all day</span> and it's not a big deal</br>   and in here, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, it's like if you don't tell them what they want to</br>   hear, they're trying to kick you out of the site.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: It's different. I started disliking the experiences in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I</br>   started getting worse and worse that it got to a point where I was thinking</br>   about maybe crossing the States again and that's when I make a decision to</br>   see if I wanted to try ________ because I heard they were paying okay.</br>   That's when I tried at ________ and ________ has been all right. It's been</br>   better since I started working at ________ here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. It's getting</br>   better.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: You've been back for?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Here? Since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2012</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">seven years</span>. After <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2012</span>, that's when I made my mind</br>   that I was not going to come back. That it was like, you know what, after</br>   this you have to just deal with it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: You said that you're married now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, we are living together. I've been with her for... I think she's</br>   the reason why I stayed, because when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here, like I said, I</br>   wanted to... Literally I didn't want to stay. I knew I had to, but I didn't</br>   want to stay. I started trying to ignore everything and I started to go out</br>   more get drunk, try to make friends. I started trying to be involved in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> now. Well, it did, it worked. I was getting involved back and forth,</br>   girlfriends, guy friends, I started liking it, but at the same time I</br>   wasn't liking it because I knew I was leaving my kids behind. I knew that</br>   even though I had to stop thinking about them, I couldn't give them money,</br>   it was still a conflict.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: When I met this woman, I seen her, I went to talk to her and we</br>   started going out and I wasn’t thought that it was going to be serious and</br>   one day she got pregnant. She got pregnant, I think that gave me life</br>   again. I knew I was going to have a baby. After that, it was like, okay,</br>   let's get used to it. You know what I'm saying? After my baby was born,</br>   beautiful baby, to me, it was like, &quot;Whatever you don't like about here,</br>   whatever your reason is, whatever, it's kid stuff, you have to just do it.</br>   You're not going to leave another kid here like you did in the states</br>   suffering.&quot; You leave a kid here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> it's going to be worse because</br>   here is worse. There's no government support, there's no work and women get</br>   beat up all the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Drugs are everywhere, people are in every corner just doing drugs</br>   like it's something normal, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">24/7</span> every day. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Years</span> go by, nobody takes them</br>   to jail, it's normal. That's how <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is. Every corner is normal. You see</br>   people laying down on the floor dead, people, they just walk over them.</br>   They don't care. They just keep going. They get to work at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">eight</span>, they</br>   don't care. I seen that many times so in that aspect, I don't think I'll</br>   ever get comfortable enough with that because to this day I still not okay</br>   by my wife just walking to school, taking my kids to school. You always</br>   have that worry, there's so much kidnapping going around, women-napping.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: This, here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>, is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> is</br>   pretty tough, but you just have to deal it, there's nothing you can do. You</br>   have to just deal with it and do the best of it. Like I said, I'm glad I'm</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>. I don't make as much as I want to to tell you the truth. I eat</br>   better and dress better, but I still don't have what I want. I can't afford</br>   a car. I can't afford my kids the best school. You know what I'm saying?</br>   It's still a little bit tough, but it's better. I'm glad <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teleltech</span> is here.</br>   Well, I'm glad I opened myself to a different world because not only</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teletach</span>, there's a lot of different sites here, they pay just about the</br>   same. It's okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: I’m glad to hear that it's going better now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah, it's nice. Like I said, it's nice but yeah, the past is always</br>   hard. The past is always hard because when I grew up there, well, I was</br>   never with my mom and I grew up alone, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> kids growing up alone, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span></br>   guys. All my brothers are trouble makers. It's a little bit tough growing</br>   up like that, but once you're grown, you're grown. You know what I'm</br>   saying? You got to leave the past behind. You just got to live your life to</br>   the best of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">days</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Is your mom and your siblings still in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and your children?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. They're still over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: What's that separation been like from all of them?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, that's been real hard, especially with my kids. To this day,</br>   Facebook we could say gets to me. If I keep up with them, it gets to me, so</br>   I don't keep up with them. I don't have Facebook. I don't have WhatsApp</br>   because I don't want to. I did had it for a couple of years for my kids,</br>   but it got to the point where my kids, we'd have nothing to talk about. I'm</br>   always struggling, they're always doing something. It was different. They</br>   don't want to hear your struggles. You can't feed them with your struggles.</br>   They're having too much fun. They're at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Burger King</span>, they’re living the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> life. They're not living what you’re living. It's like you don't</br>   have too many things in common.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: It got to the point when me and their mom spoke and they're like,</br>   &quot;You know what? You just got to back off for them. They're still crying for</br>   you. It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years</span> and they're still crying for you, you’re still</br>   crying for them, you have to let us live. You have to back off for a little</br>   bit.&quot; I was like, &quot;Well, I'm going to try to. I'm going to try to back</br>   off.&quot; I decided to back off for a little bit, not call them <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span> and</br>   try to call them every month and that distance got farther. It just kept</br>   getting farther and farther throughout the years. I haven't spoke to them</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a year</span> now. When I was spoken to them <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">last year</span>, they didn't even</br>   want to talk to me anymore. They're like, &quot;No. It's just that I don't even</br>   remember you anymore.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: How old are they?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Right now, she's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>. She just turned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">December</span> and my son turned</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">14</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">November</span>. This has been since <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2009</span> so it's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span>. She was</br>   three and four when this <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> happened and they had seen me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> times get</br>   deported and I recall my son, he'd be like me, &quot;I’m going to kill the</br>   cops.&quot; That got me. When my son started being that, that got to me. I was</br>   like, &quot;No. I don't want my son to grow up the way I grew up.&quot; That's</br>   actually what forced me to change, because I didn't want my son to have</br>   that life. That's what really made that change I guess. I started telling</br>   him, &quot;No. I'm wrong, they're right. You can't live that way. You got to let</br>   that go.&quot; That's past.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's always going to be hard, talking about my kids is always going</br>   to be hard. That's just the way it is.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: This is more of a general question, but have you received any help</br>   since you've been permanently back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, either from the government or</br>   an organization like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: No. Well, I haven't even looked for it, so I really don't know. I</br>   really don't know. I don't know if there is some help or not. This, I heard</br>   it because <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Adam</span> was walking around over there and he just told me about it.</br>   He said, &quot;<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200 bucks</span>.&quot; I be like, &quot;Hey, I need <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200 bucks</span>.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you consider yourself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I think I consider myself <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. I don't like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I don't like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>. I've dealt with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Ku Klux Klan</span>, I've dealt with black people, it's</br>   just never been a problem.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Tell me about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Ku Klux Klan</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Ku Klux Klan</span> is like... Well, over there in Georgia-</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Sorry. I know what they are, tell me about your experiences with</br>   them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, my experience with them was, they'll be on the trucks saying,</br>   &quot;What's up red bag? What's up beaners.&quot; And things like that. A lot of</br>   people would be scared. I wouldn't be scared. I'd be like, &quot;Get off the</br>   truck. What's up?&quot; They’re different. They respect things like that. It's</br>   like here and anywhere in the world, anybody that puts his foot down or</br>   stands his ground is going to be respected. I'm not going to go with it all</br>   my life, you don't be calling me beaner all my life. You know what I mean?</br>   We're going to fight, but it got to the point, like I said, that bonds</br>   people, bonds guys I think. At one point I be like, &quot;Let's fight. Yeah,</br>   let's fight.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: We'll get done fighting and they be like, &quot;Hey, you want a beer?&quot; And</br>   I be like, &quot;Yeah, let's drink a beer.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: With the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">KKK</span> people?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, yeah. With the young guys more likely. Then you would meet a</br>   lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">KKK</span> people, like go there in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Georgia</span>, a lot of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">KKK</span> people, they</br>   don't walk around like people see. Every now and then they have people, but</br>   it's not like they just are and they have their own things. You don't see</br>   it as often, and I would meet them. I would meet them, I would be at their</br>   houses, I've had a lot of white people friends and it was never a big deal.</br>   I think it was just more than culture. Everybody’s trying to be tough.</br>   Everybody needs a reason to be tough. They’re just there. It's not really</br>   something to me that ever got personal.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Okay. Throughout the interview I've noticed that you referred to</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people as them, as an othering?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. I think so.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: There's a distance between you and them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I think so, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Do you want to speak more on that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, I think it's more than culture more than anything. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> are</br>   weird. They're real weird. I’ve heard them say jokes and they'll say a joke</br>   for a long time and nobody would laugh and then at the end of the joke</br>   they'll say something like “[Son of a bitch]” and everybody starts laughing</br>   and I’m like, &quot;God almighty, I don't understand.&quot; Just because he talked</br>   about it... I don't get it. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> people don't talk about</br>   each other's mom because you're going to end up fighting. Here it's every</br>   day. Your mama, your mama, I'm like, &quot;Dude, I'm going to get off the car.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: They’re like “[Fuck your mother]”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah, you hear that all the time. You know what I’m saying? I think</br>   it's more the culture and like I said, in the State, people don’t... I</br>   don't think they fight for money as much than here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and I think</br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, everybody's trying to fight for money. I think it's like</br>   the &quot;I know I'm going to take from you, so you probably want to take from</br>   me, so I'm always ready.&quot; This is something <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> are... It's not</br>   something I was familiar with because over there in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> I was raised</br>   like, &quot;I got it. You got it. We got it.&quot; Here is different. I never really</br>   was able to really, mingle. I don't. I can't have a conversation in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   too long with somebody. Right away I don't want to be around for some</br>   reason.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I don't know why. It's probably me. I don't know. Yeah, I do feel</br>   that this is between me and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Speaking of moms, do you still speak with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. With her, I call her all the time still. Well, I'm like her</br>   best friend. I've always been the shoulder she can lay on all the time.</br>   We're always in contact all the time. Me and my mom are always in contact.</br>   My brothers are always in contact still. A lot of family members from over</br>   there, they look for me. Like I said, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about two months ago</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of my</br>   uncles came over from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">New York</span> and he took me and all my family to</br>   Acapulco, paid everything. We were so close, there's still a little bit of</br>   touch. Of course there's been distances for a lot of different reasons.</br>   Like I said, we don't have as many common things to talk about or relate</br>   with, you know what I'm saying?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's probably why, but they still every now and then even though I</br>   don't say hi on Facebook, they'll be like, &quot;Say hi to <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>. His ugly ass</br>   don’t want to talk.&quot; [Laughs]. Things like that. They'll come over, they'll</br>   send me perfumes or the shoes or things like that, every now and then. I'm</br>   sure I'm still in their minds and they're still in mine, but different.</br>   It's like right now I haven't had a cell phone in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about a year,</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">year and a   half</span>. Why? Because I can go get me a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">300-peso</span> cell phone, but I don't want</br>   it. I don't want it. I just don't want it. Then also I don't need it, I</br>   don't go get it. That keeps me apart even more we can say, but I'm okay</br>   with it. I don't feel that thing where I want to know what they're doing or</br>   how they been, I don't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Then every time there's a bad story or a bad something, bad news are</br>   always going to get there quick. If there's something bad you're going to</br>   know. That's why I don't ever have that necessity to have a cell phone and</br>   things like that. Yeah, we still keep a little bit in touch with them. We</br>   still get along.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: We're nearing the end here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: I know it's a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, you can take all the time you want. My supervisor's cool. I’m</br>   getting paid while I’m here. He's got me on payroll while I'm over here.</br>   I'm winning here and I'm winning over there. I told him, I was like, &quot;Look,</br>   I'm going to go over there or all you got to do is give me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200 bucks</span>.&quot; He's</br>   like, &quot;Put yourself on coach, man, go get your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">200</span>.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yeah. If you could have stayed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, what do you</br>   think you would have done?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, I think I would've... Right now I think about staying in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the   States</span>, I'll definitely stay with my kids. I would definitely have more</br>   money than I have now. I think I'll be good I think in... Yeah. I think I'd</br>   be better. I think I had my own stuff. When I got deported, I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span></br>   cars. I had a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Chrysler</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Sebring</span>, a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Cadillac</span> and I had an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Expedition</span> and a</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Tauro</span>. So I had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> cars when I got deported. I was making good money. I</br>   had my own place. I never had to live under my mom since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span>. I always</br>   did good. I always had everything I needed and I had bank accounts for my</br>   daughter, for my son, for my wife, for me. I always had money. I never</br>   really... never cared.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Do you know what, to tell you the truth when I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>, I never cared about dressing fancy, wearing things nice, never</br>   cared about that. Like I said, I think over there we don't worry about</br>   money. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, that's all they worry about. It's like you're always</br>   trying to look better so people could think you have something even you</br>   don't, you know what I'm saying? You got a lot of shoes that are like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200   pesos</span> and just they're new for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about two weeks</span>. For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks</span> you feel like</br>   you've got something, then in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about two weeks</span> it's going to rip off and</br>   they're not going to work. But for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks</span> everybody thinks you got</br>   something. See what I'm saying? Even though it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">200 pesos</span>, $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">10</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's how it is here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and over in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> is not. I</br>   never worried about it. When I was over there, I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> sandals</br>   with my ragged shirt. I never really cared. Also, my nice car, I knew I had</br>   money, so I never cared. Here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> it seems like I care more to look</br>   good, to have good things, probably because you don't have it. It's more in</br>   your mind. That's what I think. I don’t know. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, like I</br>   said, my wife, my kids had their own room, toy room, sleeping room. We had</br>   a lot of space around the house. We had everything. She never had to work.</br>   My kids never had to worry about anything. It was good. As long as your</br>   family is good, you're good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: If I would be in the States, I'm thinking I would have a lot of</br>   money, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Now that you're back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and you have been back, what do you</br>   think you'd like to do? What are your hopes and dreams basically?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Here? Well, like I said, first, I was a little bit stubborn. I would</br>   think. I was thinking maybe if you work hard, you do hard, everything's</br>   going to be all right. I started and no, if you need a career, you need a</br>   paper. That's what I'm doing right now, I’m studying right now, I’m getting</br>   my studies here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and hopefully I could get a diploma or something,</br>   get an engineering or something different. Like I said, when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got</br>   here at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Teletech</span>, I didn't even know how to keyboard. Like I said, I never</br>   cared about technology. I never needed it. I was always out in the street</br>   or not in the street, like at the corner street. The bowling alley,</br>   wherever, anywhere else, but not home. I never really cared about it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I never needed it. I never needed technology. No. Back at the time we</br>   had the beepers so we could have beepers. I never needed it. When I got</br>   here, I wasn't used to it. When I got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Teletech</span>, I didn't even know what</br>   the key pads were. They gave me a training and I got better. I exceeded</br>   everybody in the class. I became Doctor <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Dish</span> faster than a lot of ways and</br>   right now I'm back here. They took me in right away and I'm good. I got a</br>   nice supervisor, he lets me do whatever I want as long as I know what I'm</br>   doing. Right? You come to know what you're doing, you wake up knowing</br>   you’re going to work, you got something you got accomplish. You don't go to</br>   work to do nothing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Once he knows, I know what I'm here for and he gives you breaks, like</br>   right now. I told him, &quot;Hey, look, I want to go.&quot; And he said, &quot;Go, no</br>   problem.&quot; If it had been somebody else he would be like, &quot;No, you can't</br>   even go to the bathroom.&quot; I've always been a hard worker no matter what</br>   kind of employment I get; I'm thinking I'm always going to try to do my</br>   best. This case, I didn't know what this was, I’m on top of my game now and</br>   I didn't know nothing about it. I was lost of technology. You get me out of</br>   cave, we got a... What do you call it? Evolutionary?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Evolve.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Evolve, evolution, I don’t know, whatever. You have to get into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2019</span></br>   and then you have to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">2020</span>. You got to keep going.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yeah, with the times.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Exactly. You have to do it. Like I said, I don't have a need for</br>   technology, but I know about technology. I know how to work myself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Okay. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">First</span>, before we get into the last set of questions, do you</br>   think that in the near future you'll go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: No, I don't think so, unless <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Donald Trump</span> gives a break. Other than</br>   that, I don't think so. Illegally, I don't think so. I wouldn't dare to</br>   leave my daughter for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span> without her dad. If they give me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five   years</span> and I wouldn't be able to go through it. I wouldn't be able to. I'm</br>   not going to. No, I wouldn't do it. I wouldn't make that decision. If it's</br>   legal, yes. If it's illegal, no. I wouldn’t do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: These last few questions are more of a reflection kind of thing.</br>   There is a sentiment from a lot of migrants tied to this whole idea of</br>   being binational that says that you're neither here nor from there, and I</br>   was wondering what you think about that statement.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: No. I think I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>. Yeah. [Laughs].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Alright.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: But I'm just here, but I don't know. I don't feel that way. Like I</br>   said, a lot of people, they just want free things. They want easy things. I</br>   understand a lot of governments are tough all the way around the world.</br>   It's probably what most of migrants had to do. Like here, I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>,</br>   that's what gets more people. I don’t think it's the poverty, I think it's</br>   the violence that gets people out of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I think that's what's it. I</br>   think if the governments would just be more like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>, you did</br>   something wrong and you're going in, no exceptions, no nothing. You're</br>   looking at me wrong. I'm taking you in. I think that's perfect.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I think that's what every government needs to get. Simple, straight</br>   up because people, we don't listen. We want things easy way all the time</br>   and we don’t want to work for nothing. A lot of migrants, they just get to</br>   leave their country, I think is violence more than poverty because land, we</br>   got land, everybody can plant tomatoes, plant trees, plant whatever, you're</br>   going to eat. If you go to the towns, nearest towns where people don't have</br>   jobs, they're fat, they're eating good, they got all kinds of food, they</br>   got all kinds of fruits, all kinds of animals. They got food, but they</br>   don't feel safe. They're not going to let their daughter go out of their</br>   house.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: They're not going to let their kids go out of his house. You know</br>   what I'm saying? A lot of people do that. That's the reason they leave</br>   because of violence. That’s how I feel. I don’t know.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: I'm very interested in hearing your opinion on why young <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   men in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> turn into crime and gangs.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I think it's loneliness more likely. They don't understand you're</br>   young, you're in a different country. It's like they're probably feeling</br>   the reverse thing I'm feeling. They’re in their country, they don't</br>   understand money yet, they don't understand duties yet, they just want to</br>   have fun and unfortunately fun leads you to the wrong place. They’re young,</br>   I think that's the only reason. They’re just young. Nothing you can do.</br>   Then, I don't know. I think everybody does that. Because even white people</br>   are like that. You get a lot of white people, they're involved in drugs,</br>   they’re... You see that all the time. I don't know. I think it's just</br>   people, man. I just think it's just people are just lonely. They're looking</br>   for God and God is not showing up.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Oh my God. That's true. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's what I think and I think it's everywhere. Praying and praying</br>   and no answers. I don't know. That's what I think. You grow up and you just</br>   got to leave that stuff behind, can’t blame nobody. You just got to all</br>   take responsibilities. Some people just take responsibility once they've</br>   done something they cannot regret anymore. It's the way it is. I think it's</br>   like that everywhere. Not only in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>, I think it's like that</br>   everywhere. It's tough. God gotta show up.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. No, he's there. He's been there for me a lot. I ain’t going to</br>   say he don't, because I think God is for everybody, but sometimes we just</br>   want more I guess. I don't know. He's been there for me. I can't say he</br>   don't. Like I said they were going to be <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span> the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, he gave</br>   me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time they were giving me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>, I only did <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>. I think</br>   he's been there. My kids, they had that mentality when I was growing up,</br>   like I said, now they're grown and they're happy. So, I think God is there.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: So, what can the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government do to help returning migrants</br>   reintegrate into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> society?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I think what they can do is stop bringing so many people into the</br>   cities and allow them to work their lands safe. I think that will solve the</br>   problems in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Because a lot of the people that come from the towns to</br>   the cities because of that, because the violence is out there. You get into</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span> trucks full of people with guns and drunks and drugged up and</br>   you see that every night, every night, every night and you heard that the</br>   neighbors, she just got raped and the other one got raped and the other one</br>   got raped. People start trying to look for protection. I'm thinking if they</br>   push away people from the city, take them back to their home lands, let</br>   them work. I’m thinking that will do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: And what can the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> government do to help <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   deportees and the family that they leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I don’t know. I don't think there's too much they can do. It's hard</br>   for them. I'm thinking it's hard for the government also. They can't tell</br>   what people are feeling they can just tell what they can see. If they see</br>   people dressing up, acting up, it's like a guy told me, he says, &quot;You look</br>   like a duck, you quack like a duck, you might be a duck.&quot; It's a</br>   government, they can't say, &quot;Look at the guy's feelings. Take care of his</br>   feelings.&quot; They're not going to do that. They can’t, they're not God. They</br>   don't know. All they can do is apply the law. It's all they can do. It's</br>   hard. I don't think problems in the world has to do with governments. I</br>   think they do, but it has to do more. Have you read the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yes. Some of it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I'm thinking just God got his own plan. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: If you would have asked me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months ago</span>, I would've said no, but</br>   I actually took a class.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: You took a class?</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, I’ve read the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="WORK_OF_ART">Bible</span> like I said. I’ve had a lot of experience</br>   with God. He's been my best friend. I think he's there, he's got his own</br>   plan, not our plan. He's got his plan.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Well, those were all the questions I had. To wrap this up, I want</br>   to give you the chance to tell me anything else that you want to add,</br>   anything that you felt that you may not have gotten across or anything that</br>   you want to add or clarify or whatever you want to say. Now's the moment to</br>   do it. Go ahead if you want to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, like I say, I don't know, maybe you would ask me this questions</br>   before, when you touch my kids, that's always going to get me. I can't help</br>   it. Even at the house, even... I got their picture on the wall. Every time</br>   I walk in the room it's hard. I can't help it, but everything else is just,</br>   we just have to grow up in this stage. You just have to grow up and you</br>   just have to make better decisions. There's no way around it. There's just</br>   that and you can't live your past and the future, or your present. You</br>   can't live it. You can't live the past in your present, you've got to live</br>   the present. That's it. I don't know. So many problems in the world, can't</br>   solve them, so I never really thought about it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I just try my best <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span> and that's it. There's nothing else I</br>   can do. I don't think there's nothing else any of us can do, unless you</br>   can... No, I don't think so. I don’t think even the president can do</br>   anything. I'm thinking if the president starts giving everybody money,</br>   everybody's just going to use it on drugs or misuse it or things like that.</br>   Sometimes money can turn you bad also. I don’t know. Life's hard. It's</br>   tough. I don't think we got the answers. I don't know. What do you think?</br>   You think there's an answer?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: No. It's crazy because I think <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> have a very, and everyone</br>   in gen...</br> </br> </br>   Continued</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Claudia: I don't know. You just want to help so many people and you want to</br>   do that as much as you can. And then, there's got to be a point where you</br>   realize that you can't help everyone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: That's same mentality I have. Because like I said, I've been with a</br>   lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. And I've ate with a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> in their tables. And</br>   I've slept with a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> in their homes. Been in their parties. I</br>   was going to marry <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> white girls. I mean I've ate any... I don't</br>   know. Chicken patty. Whatever. Anything. You know what I'm saying? I can't</br>   think of all the food that I've ate over there. Like a sweet tea, cold tea,</br>   a chicken fried, whatever. It don't matter. Corn. Whatever. Everything.</br>   I've ate every kind of meal that you can think of. I've experienced the</br>   cities, the countries in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: And I think there's a lot of good people in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. Because let's</br>   say an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> comes here to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and does something wrong. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span></br>   will stone him quick. They will burn him alive in front of everybody and</br>   have a party. You know what I am saying? And <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> are so, &quot;You did</br>   something wrong, but I'm not going to take it. Apply the law.&quot; You see what</br>   I'm saying? So to me, that's why I say I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> because I've lived for</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. Not because of the government, because I've lived for the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. Because I know how my people are, black people are, people that</br>   are in between and they're born in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>. I mean just living in the</br>   States, you're going to find people that are bad everywhere in the world.</br>   But I've definitely found more bad people here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a month</span> that</br>   I've found in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> all the time I lived there. So to me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span> is</br>   nice. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span> is right. It's good. If there'll be a war, I'll go</br>   fight for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">United States</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: You can enlist.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Enlist in the-</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Even if it's against <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, you're going.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Even if it's against <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, let's go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: No. It's crazy because I feel like I came into this project...</br>   This is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the second year</span> that I've been doing it. And I came in thinking</br>   like, &quot;Oh. Then people must hate <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>.&quot; And I was so blown</br>   away by the fact that people don't. People even if they've gotten deported</br>   are still so grateful to all of the experiences that they had and the</br>   people that they met.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. Like I said, here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I mean, when we <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here,</br>   they used to call us gabachos. They'll be like, &quot;Gabachos..&quot; Big, old,</br>   huge. They're everywhere. Why? Because we will speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. Because we</br>   didn't like their jokes. Because we looked like them. Because we don't act</br>   like them. It got to the point where they're like, &quot;Okay. So gabachos.</br>   Their not scared. They'll fight.&quot; So we get our respects, but we still</br>   don't know how to mingle. Because to this day, I've meet a lot of people</br>   that are born here and they're on their own. They don't mingle. They'll say</br>   what's up to somebody, but you're not going to hear them having a</br>   conversation with somebody because they cannot mingle. I don't think if</br>   we're going to be able to mingle. Then we're going to get old and we're not</br>   going to mingle. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: But I see a lot of people that stays here. They can't mingle. They</br>   can't. They just get along with people that have the same history. But with</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>, they can't mingle. I don't know why. I don't think they'll</br>   ever... It was like when you tasted heaven. You're never going to forget</br>   heaven. And you still want to go to heaven.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">The United States</span> is heaven?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: This is heaven. I'm talking about everything. Fruit, meat. I mean</br>   everything. Even <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Burger King</span> don't taste the same here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. You go to</br>   a Pizza Hut. They take the cheese. They take the bacon. They take the</br>   pepperoni. You know what I'm saying? I mean you go to get one pizza and it</br>   have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">10</span> slices of pepperoni. Next one has only got <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>. You get it out of</br>   there and the cheese is already wrinkling altogether because the pizza</br>   don't have enough cheese. I mean you see these in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> all the time.</br>   Nothing tastes the same. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Burger King</span> doesn't taste the same. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span></br>   don't taste the same. Close enough, but you're always remembering. You're</br>   always remembering.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: What's your favorite <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> food?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: My favorite <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> food had to be barbecue chicken. Had to be.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Interesting.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: And chili cheese's okay. But barbecue chicken. And now, not just</br>   anybody. Like I said, I've been with a lot of people and some people don't</br>   know how to cook. And then, some people just wow. Some people just got a...</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Thanksgiving</span>. Wow. I mean I don't think you could find somebody in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span></br>   that knows how to cook sweet ham. I don't think you could find one. I don't</br>   think you could find somebody in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> know how to make some chili beans.</br>   I don't think you can find one. It's a lot of things. Sweet tea. I mean</br>   there's so many things that you're not going to find in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Like I</br>   never ate so many guisados in my life, because I also was used to eating</br>   other food. To this day I miss it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: My wife, when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here, she always be mad. She hates</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span>. She hates when I speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. She hates a lot of things. And</br>   we will go out. She'll be like, &quot;Hey. Let's go get some chicken nuggets.&quot;</br>   This is funny, right? So we went to buy some chicken nuggets and she</br>   started heating up the tortillas. I'm like, &quot;What are you doing?&quot; She's</br>   like, &quot;Heating up some tortillas.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Why?.&quot; So they said, &quot;We can</br>   eat the...&quot; I'm like, &quot;No. You eat this with ketchup.&quot; And she's like, &quot;You</br>   crazy. You and your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> life. And you're in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> now.&quot; And starts</br>   talking shit. And she sees me eating and she'll dip it. Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">next week</span> she's asking for the chicken nuggets. You see what I'm</br>   saying? Same thing with a lot of things. With pizza, man. It's like the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> pieces she's fighting and she's arguing. She's debating.</br>   She's just talking, &quot;I don't want it.&quot; You know what? She gets her <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   bite. Next thing you know, she wants a slice. Next thing she's just asking</br>   for pizza. Next thing you know, she wants pizza every week. It's like I'm</br>   telling you. Once you start enjoying the good things in life or whatever,</br>   you start experiencing all those things. You're never going to want to go</br>   back. You're always want to keep living the life you're living. So it's</br>   good to be poor. But once they get you out of poor, you don't want to ever</br>   be poor again.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: It's tough.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Especially when the world is so against you. Like we were saying</br>   before we began.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. I'm telling you it's like... I remember when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here,</br>   I hear people be like, &quot;They make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a hundred and some</span> pesos a day. They make</br>   800 pesos a week.&quot; That is $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">40</span>. I mean and you walk anywhere. You walk here</br>   everything is just the same price as in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">America</span>. So nothing's cheaper. So</br>   you can afford it. And you're like, &quot;How is your government adding these</br>   things up? I don't get it.&quot; But it's like that. And nothing changes. And</br>   when they give them a raise, they give them <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">seven pesos</span> raise. You know</br>   what I'm saying? It's like, &quot;Oh my God. Why don't people start a fucking</br>   war or something? I don't get it.&quot; But people learn to mingle and they</br>   learn to live this way. And they will call beans frijolitos. They give all</br>   this extra word at the end so it could just sound better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: But anyways when I <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> got here, I couldn't mingle with that. And</br>   I'd be like, &quot;Man. Why are these people just.... They're mad, man.&quot; So I</br>   started enjoying them. And I started eating their food and I started</br>   realizing that, &quot;Well, it's okay. They got seasoning. They got taste.&quot; So</br>   all of that counts when you're eating pork. But at one point another, my</br>   mind tells me, &quot;Yes. It's okay to eat beans and rice <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every other day</span>. But</br>   not every day.&quot; You, know? I want some meat, man. I want some chicken. I</br>   want some beef. I want some pork. I want to go to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Burger King</span>. I want to go</br>   bowling. If I'm bored, I don't want to just kick it outside my house. And I</br>   go spend some money. I want to go take my kids shopping, get some stuff,</br>   eat some things, try something else. Take them something. Money won't let</br>   you. It won't let you. You need money. And it's not letting you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: But that's how it is. That's how it is for a lot of people. Thank God</br>   to me it’s not that way. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The last couple of years</span>. Thank God to me, I've</br>   struggled. Like I said, he's always helped me out. He's always helped me</br>   out. I've never been like the kind of person that, &quot;Okay. You give me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">a   </span>hundred dollars. It's okay. I want <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">400</span>.&quot; I've never been that way. It's</br>   like if I'm making a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">hundred</span>, I want to make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">200</span> next time. If I make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">200</span>,</br>   I will make <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">300</span> next time. And it's never enough. And if I could fill up a</br>   whole bank of my money and I'm not going to use it. That's good with me. I</br>   don't want it, but let's fill it up. Let's keep it there. And a lot of</br>   people are not like that. A lot of people are just like, &quot;Okay. I'm good</br>   with <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">500 pesos</span>.&quot; I don't know. But this is where we live. This is we had to</br>   live in.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: So what do you think? That's enough? How long we been here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: I don't know. What do you think? We've been here over [crosstalk</br>   00:08:58].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, there's a lot of more stories. No. I think it's enough. Because</br>   I got to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Yeah. I think it's enough.</br> </br> </br>   Claudia: Are you satisfied with what you said?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: Well, yeah. Like I said, I don't think there'll be enough time.</br>   There's so many stories. So many things I've seen. But sometimes when you</br>   think about them, you can't recall them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Claudia</span>: Yeah. That's true. No. I think this has been perfect. I think it's</br>   been very, very good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Daniel</span>: I hope so.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
