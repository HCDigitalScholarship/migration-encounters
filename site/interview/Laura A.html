Or did you have a visa?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, I went across the border.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you have memories of the crossing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Tell me about them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I went with my dad, only with my dad and my other sister, my little</br>   sister. We went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Piedras Negras</span> and then we found a person that was going</br>   to cross us. That person, maybe he didn't know the exactly... road. We were</br>   at the dessert at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:00 AM</span>. We take <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">some gallons</span> of water. We didn't have</br>   like any other stuff, like water and food to eat. We start walking at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">4:00   </span>AM. And then, well I didn't know what time it was it, but we stopped eating</br>   at the middle of the desert. We were eating tacos. Well my little sister</br>   was, she was little. She was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years old</span>, and she was walking with</br>   us. She was crying because she couldn't do it anymore. She wanted to… My</br>   dad pulled her out. Just helped her out, he pulled her on his back, and he</br>   continued walking with us. I was trying to be strong, because of my sister</br>   who was little. And then, we saw the la migra, the police, immigration. We</br>   go back, then we stay like lay down on the middle at the dessert.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Then it got dark, and then it had started to rain. We were</br>   walking—we didn't know where we are. We were walking, and we have some...</br>   Well it was like a little mountain, I don't know how to say that, but it</br>   was like a little fold. We were walking, like in a little line. And we went</br>   with our cousins. One of my cousin was going to fall down. Then we got to</br>   the line, we were walking. It was raining, it was dark. The only light that</br>   we can see was the moonlight. We didn't have any light at all. We were</br>   walking, then when we got to the... We saw the road, but I don't know where</br>   we, exactly. We just lay down. That rain was getting to us. My little</br>   sister was shaking, because she was cold. We didn't have any jackets. My</br>   dad was very scared because my sister didn't answer, my sister fell asleep.</br>   And she was shaking a lot, but she never answer. We tried to wake her up,</br>   and she never answer. We're like, &quot;Oh, my God, what happened to her?&quot; But</br>   then she wake up, and she said she was fine, that she was cold only.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: We were with many other people. Then we stay there, we fall asleep,</br>   then somebody wakes us up and tell us to run to a truck. We run to a truck,</br>   and there was two people that were driving, and he sit me on the back. He</br>   lay my sister down and my dad was outside on the back of the truck. Well,</br>   they drive all to, I think it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arizona</span>. Then we get to one home, they</br>   just remove us the shoes. We didn't have any shoes on. We went to a little</br>   room, and there was many other people that were already crossed there. The</br>   only thing that we have, it was like a little bit, they gave us food to</br>   eat. We have it. So, we stayed there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like twenty days</span> because they</br>   didn't know—I mean, they didn't tell my other relatives, my family, how</br>   much was going to be. So, we didn't have the money to take this, so we say</br>   like twenty days there and there was people that have arms. We were</br>   sleeping and there was somebody taking care of us, so we don't escape or, I</br>   don't know, but they have arms, like huge arms.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Guns?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Guns. I mean, I was very afraid because of my sister. She was a</br>   little girl. My dad was afraid as well. He just wanted to take us out of</br>   there, but we have to wait like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the twenty days</span>. When we go to the bathroom</br>   when we need, my dad took us to the bathroom. To eat, they only give us <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span></br>   egg, and just a little piece of bread in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the whole day</span>. It was pretty much</br>   the worst. And then, when my family takes us out, that person that would</br>   take us out to another person, that person sit me in the front of the car.</br>   And that person has a gun right beside me. I was pretty scared about it,</br>   because I thought they were going to kill us or something. Once they took</br>   us to the other person—the other person was pretty nice—he took us to his</br>   house. He told us to take shower, to grab the food that we want. So, that</br>   person was very nice with us. He give us food, we took a shower, and then</br>   he took us to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span> where we supposed to be. So that person was pretty</br>   nice. Then we got there, and we started to go to school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Which town in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Salinas</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Salinas</span>? And when you got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, what did you think? How did</br>   it compare to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> for you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">summer</span>, so it was pretty nice and I did like it, but</br>   once I went to school, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.</br>   I have teachers, and I didn't know what they were saying. It was pretty</br>   difficult to us because we didn't know what to say, we didn't know what</br>   they were telling us. It was pretty bad because there was people, like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people, that instead of helping you, they were just making fun of</br>   you because you didn't know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And what grade were you in at that point?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Seventh</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">Seventh</span> grade. Did any teachers help you out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Not too much. I mean, I try to do my best but I don't know. I don't</br>   even know how to start to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> people right</br>   beside me and they didn't help me out. They didn't help me out. They didn't</br>   let me know what there was saying. It was pretty difficult. But once I</br>   start to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, well to start understanding just a little bit, I</br>   just got involved to it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long did it take?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, it took a long time. Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Three years</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You didn't feel comfortable until you were in high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, sometimes I was missing school like too many days because I did</br>   not want to go and people making fun of me. There was many people, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span></br>   people that speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> to me, but I wasn't feeling comfortable when I go</br>   to my classrooms and I don't have like friends that speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and speak</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. So it was very uncomfortable for me. I was pretty scared of doing</br>   homework. I was pretty scared reading the book when the teacher told me to</br>   read it. I was pretty lost. I didn't know what to do, so I was afraid to go</br>   to school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And were your parents working?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They were working.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And what were they doing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My mom was working at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">McDonald's</span> and my dad was a dishwasher.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you're at school, and were they working hard? Did you see them? I</br>   mean was it kind of the thing where they weren't home a lot or did you get</br>   to see them a good bit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well the only days that I got to see them was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the days</span> that they</br>   don't work, days off. Which was one day and it was a Monday I think.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What did you and your sister do on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Saturday</span> and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Sunday</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, just staying home, watching TV because we were pretty afraid</br>   to go out because they were telling us that the police were going to take</br>   us if we didn't go to school, and there was many people that told us not to</br>   open the window and see what was outside because the police was going to</br>   come and take us. So we were just pretty afraid of it, and we just watching</br>   TV in our room and just waiting for my parents to come back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, in high school when you started to feel more comfortable, did you</br>   make friends?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I did make so many friends. I went out with them and it was more</br>   comfortable with them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you like high school or not?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You did? How come?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was</br>   trying to teach me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>—well she teach me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> because I learned a</br>   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,</br>   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad</br>   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty</br>   lost at that time as well—I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the</br>   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty</br>   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us—she was</br>   coming back and she left us <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like three or four years</span>. So I was in charge of</br>   my little sister.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It's a lot to put on someone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he</br>   didn't want to go to work. He was just in his room crying for my mom</br>   watching TV. He didn't want us to see him like that. But I was the oldest</br>   sister and I do remember when my dad just hugged me and cry about my mom</br>   and say, “Why she left us? Why?” because we were girls. So, my dad didn't</br>   know what to do with us because we were girls. It was pretty difficult for</br>   me to see that as a daughter and see my dad crying. I mean, he didn't want</br>   to go to work and we didn't have nothing to eat. We have family there, but,</br>   you know, sometimes the family doesn't help us too much. You have more from</br>   other people than the family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, did you have to go to work so that you could eat?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, I try to push my dad to go to work. And then, he started with</br>   work and he talk with his boss and I was going to work with him. We were</br>   cleaning the restaurant and I try to work with my dad like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How did that work out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I was just cleaning the tables and just vacuum the lobby. That's all</br>   I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And when did you start doing that? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">sixteen years old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, I didn't finish it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, tell me what happened.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well I was almost finished; it was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> mouths to finish. But I</br>   didn't finish it because I'd see the problems with my dad and my mom, and I</br>   start to go out with my friends, and I was involved in a car accident. I</br>   wasn't driving, but I wasn't all up there, and I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Obviously you didn't have papers, but had you been drinking? Was</br>   there something that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: We were drinking. I wasn't driving, but I was in the car, so they</br>   found alcohol.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Alcohol on the vehicle and it's like at the border.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Hardly anything to be deported for, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I know. I tried to stay there, but it was better for me to get</br>   deported than stay. I didn't want to be in jail. They tried to put me in</br>   jail for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Eighteen</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You are <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eighteen</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I didn't want to be there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you have a lawyer?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I did have a lawyer. The lawyer told me, “You have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> options. You</br>   can stay in jail <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two months</span> or you can go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.” So, I just</br>   decide to go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think your decision was influenced by the conflicts between</br>   your parents?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was because when I got here, I went to school, but I didn't</br>   finish to study. I didn’t finish because of the economy problems. My dad</br>   didn't have money, my mom didn't have money, so I just decided to stop</br>   going to school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: When you made the decision to go, was it a voluntary—?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Interviewer. Were you given a limit as to when you could apply for a visa</br>   to go back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, no, they never told me that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And so, you went alone? You got deported alone?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I was pretty scared cause I didn't know. Once I get there, I got to</br>   Tijuana, and from there, I took a bus to here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was there anyone here to greet you or welcome you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: My family, my mom's family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your mom's family? Any government people?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, nothing like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you knew that you had family here that you could come to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I do have family here that I can come to. But, you know, sometimes</br>   your family doesn't help too much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How did that go?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: It was fine, but I did have many problems with my family. Because I</br>   didn't have my parents here, and as I mentioned to you, they didn't have</br>   money to send me and sometimes they asked me for money to even eat.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Your parents did?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, my family. They didn't want me to eat their food.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I had to work.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And what did you get? What kind of work could you get? You were</br>   eighteen right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, I was working at a little place to make juice. We were making</br>   juice. I was working there, and then I heard about call centers. I started</br>   work there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Have you been working there ever since? How do you like that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, I don't like that too much because I want to start studying.</br>   But then, I met a guy and I got married and I have kids.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How many kids?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I have <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>, but now I'm thinking on my kids. I'm not with him</br>   anymore and I am alone with my kids. So, it's pretty hard for me because I</br>   didn't want them to go through the same thing that my daddy and my mom</br>   went. And now for my kids, it's pretty hard to explain them that I'm not</br>   going to be with their dad anymore. That it's pretty hard for me even to</br>   take them to school because I have to work and sometimes my kids are</br>   telling me not to go to work. They cry a lot because they miss me because</br>   they don't see me too much. Call centers have a long time that you have to</br>   be working. But I mean there's no other way that I can go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Does your family help out now? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well my mom helps me to take care of my babies.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: She's back now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: She's back now. She's taking care of my babies right now. But it's</br>   pretty difficult for her because now she's getting old and she is sick</br>   right now. So, she can’t take care of them pretty well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old are they?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Five and three years old</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, the call center is tough, but is it enough to make a living for</br>   you and your children?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, it's not enough because sometimes I don't have money to take</br>   my kids to school because we have to pay like rent, we have to pay the</br>   lights that we have to pay, and we have to buy the things that we're going</br>   to eat. There's so many things that we have to do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, looking back on your time in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, do you think you're a</br>   different person because of your time in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>? Do you think that if you'd</br>   never gone you would be different than the way you are now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. Sometimes from the experience, you learn so many things. So</br>   maybe if I didn't went through all the things that I went through, maybe I</br>   wasn't going to be the person that I am right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Are there things that you miss from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, not really.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: The things that you’re glad you don't have to deal with anymore in</br>   the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: People that make fun of you. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So, you never sort of got over that. I mean you felt that a lot?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: When I was in school, my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> is not too better. It's not <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">100%</span>,</br>   and there's people that make fun of you. So, I mean I try to do my best</br>   but…</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, was your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> still good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, I was actually feeling so weird because there was many people</br>   that was staring at me—like I don't know why, but I feel like the look of</br>   me. So, I was like, “What? What do I have? Or did I say something wrong?”</br>   But once I started to go to school, it was pretty difficult for me because</br>   I didn't understand some things.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think if you were in charge of life and you could relive your</br>   life, would you send yourself to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Actually, on my mind, I want to go back there. I want to try to get</br>   a visa and I want to go back there again.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: To live or to visit?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: I want to go live because I want my kids to have a better life. You</br>   know, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, I mean it's not the worst, but I don't want my kids to</br>   get involved in drug things, and stuff. And sometimes I just talk to my son</br>   and I talk about the life that I got there and the things that I was doing</br>   with my parents. He's like, “I want to go out there, mama.” I want to take</br>   him there. I want to show him, I want him to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, and he can</br>   study there. I want to go back. I think you can do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is your little sister still there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No, she is here with me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: She came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. All my family is back here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, they are all back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: They're back. Actually my dad was deported as well.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: But your mom came back with you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: She stayed there, and after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span> she came back with us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. And with your sister?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: With my sister.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. Your dreams are really to somehow make enough money to go</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Yeah. My dreams is making money. I want to try to have a house for</br>   my kids. I want to finish my school. I want to finish a career as well. I</br>   mean, I have to be an example for my kid. He sees me that I finished my</br>   school, my career, I think he will do it someday. I just want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: We're sort of finishing up. Is there anything you'd like to say that</br>   you haven't said yet, about your experiences as a returning migrant? Or</br>   living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> or the process that got you here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Laura</span>: Well, I mean it's pretty difficult. Everything is difficult because</br>   you start to live a better life there, and once you have come here, you</br>   have nothing. You don't even have a bed to sleep. The only thing that I</br>   could say is that, if they're still on <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing">Laura: I went with my parents.     Anne: And did you cross the border? Or did you have a visa?     Laura: No, I went across the border.    </span> Anne: Do you have memories of the crossing?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Tell me about them.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I went with my dad, only with my dad and my other sister, my little</br>   sister. We went to Piedras Negras and then we found a person that was going</br>   to cross us. That person, maybe he didn't know the exactly... road. We were</br>   at the dessert at 4:00 AM. We take some gallons of water. We didn't have</br>   like any other stuff, like water and food to eat. We start walking at 4:00</br>   AM. And then, well I didn't know what time it was it, but we stopped eating</br>   at the middle of the desert. We were eating tacos. Well my little sister</br>   was, she was little. She was like three years old, and she was walking with</br>   us. She was crying because she couldn't do it anymore. She wanted to… My</br>   dad pulled her out. Just helped her out, he pulled her on his back, and he</br>   continued walking with us. I was trying to be strong, because of my sister</br>   who was little. And then, we saw the la migra, the police, immigration. We</br>   go back, then we stay like lay down on the middle at the dessert.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Then it got dark, and then it had started to rain. We were</br>   walking—we didn't know where we are. We were walking, and we have some...</br>   Well it was like a little mountain, I don't know how to say that, but it</br>   was like a little fold. We were walking, like in a little line. And we went</br>   with our cousins. One of my cousin was going to fall down. Then we got to</br>   the line, we were walking. It was raining, it was dark. The only light that</br>   we can see was the moonlight. We didn't have any light at all. We were</br>   walking, then when we got to the... We saw the road, but I don't know where</br>   we, exactly. We just lay down. That rain was getting to us. My little</br>   sister was shaking, because she was cold. We didn't have any jackets. My</br>   dad was very scared because my sister didn't answer, my sister fell asleep.</br>   And she was shaking a lot, but she never answer. We tried to wake her up,</br>   and she never answer. We're like, &quot;Oh, my God, what happened to her?&quot; But</br>   then she wake up, and she said she was fine, that she was cold only.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We were with many other people. Then we stay there, we fall asleep,</br>   then somebody wakes us up and tell us to run to a truck. We run to a truck,</br>   and there was two people that were driving, and he sit me on the back. He</br>   lay my sister down and my dad was outside on the back of the truck. Well,</br>   they drive all to, I think it was Arizona. Then we get to one home, they</br>   just remove us the shoes. We didn't have any shoes on. We went to a little</br>   room, and there was many other people that were already crossed there. The</br>   only thing that we have, it was like a little bit, they gave us food to</br>   eat. We have it. So, we stayed there for like twenty days because they</br>   didn't know—I mean, they didn't tell my other relatives, my family, how</br>   much was going to be. So, we didn't have the money to take this, so we say</br>   like twenty days there and there was people that have arms. We were</br>   sleeping and there was somebody taking care of us, so we don't escape or, I</br>   don't know, but they have arms, like huge arms.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Guns?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Guns. I mean, I was very afraid because of my sister. She was a</br>   little girl. My dad was afraid as well. He just wanted to take us out of</br>   there, but we have to wait like the twenty days. When we go to the bathroom</br>   when we need, my dad took us to the bathroom. To eat, they only give us one</br>   egg, and just a little piece of bread in the whole day. It was pretty much</br>   the worst. And then, when my family takes us out, that person that would</br>   take us out to another person, that person sit me in the front of the car.</br>   And that person has a gun right beside me. I was pretty scared about it,</br>   because I thought they were going to kill us or something. Once they took</br>   us to the other person—the other person was pretty nice—he took us to his</br>   house. He told us to take shower, to grab the food that we want. So, that</br>   person was very nice with us. He give us food, we took a shower, and then</br>   he took us to California where we supposed to be. So that person was pretty</br>   nice. Then we got there, and we started to go to school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Which town in California?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Salinas.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Salinas? And when you got to California, what did you think? How did</br>   it compare to Mexico for you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, it was summer, so it was pretty nice and I did like it, but</br>   once I went to school, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.</br>   I have teachers, and I didn't know what they were saying. It was pretty</br>   difficult to us because we didn't know what to say, we didn't know what</br>   they were telling us. It was pretty bad because there was people, like</br>   Mexican people, that instead of helping you, they were just making fun of</br>   you because you didn't know English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what grade were you in at that point?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Seventh grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Seventh grade. Did any teachers help you out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Not too much. I mean, I try to do my best but I don't know. I don't</br>   even know how to start to learn English because I have Mexican people right</br>   beside me and they didn't help me out. They didn't help me out. They didn't</br>   let me know what there was saying. It was pretty difficult. But once I</br>   start to learn English, well to start understanding just a little bit, I</br>   just got involved to it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, it took a long time. Like three years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Three years?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You didn't feel comfortable until you were in high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, sometimes I was missing school like too many days because I did</br>   not want to go and people making fun of me. There was many people, Mexican</br>   people that speak Spanish to me, but I wasn't feeling comfortable when I go</br>   to my classrooms and I don't have like friends that speak English and speak</br>   Spanish. So it was very uncomfortable for me. I was pretty scared of doing</br>   homework. I was pretty scared reading the book when the teacher told me to</br>   read it. I was pretty lost. I didn't know what to do, so I was afraid to go</br>   to school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And were your parents working?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They were working.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what were they doing?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My mom was working at McDonald's and my dad was a dishwasher.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you're at school, and were they working hard? Did you see them? I</br>   mean was it kind of the thing where they weren't home a lot or did you get</br>   to see them a good bit?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well the only days that I got to see them was the days that they</br>   don't work, days off. Which was one day and it was a Monday I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you and your sister do on Saturday and Sunday?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, just staying home, watching TV because we were pretty afraid</br>   to go out because they were telling us that the police were going to take</br>   us if we didn't go to school, and there was many people that told us not to</br>   open the window and see what was outside because the police was going to</br>   come and take us. So we were just pretty afraid of it, and we just watching</br>   TV in our room and just waiting for my parents to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, in high school when you started to feel more comfortable, did you</br>   make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did make so many friends. I went out with them and it was more</br>   comfortable with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like high school or not?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did? How come?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was</br>   trying to teach me English—well she teach me English because I learned a</br>   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,</br>   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad</br>   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty</br>   lost at that time as well—I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the</br>   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty</br>   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us—she was</br>   coming back and she left us like three or four years. So I was in charge of</br>   my little sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a lot to put on someone.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he</br>   didn't want to go to work. He was just in his room crying for my mom</br>   watching TV. He didn't want us to see him like that. But I was the oldest</br>   sister and I do remember when my dad just hugged me and cry about my mom</br>   and say, “Why she left us? Why?” because we were girls. So, my dad didn't</br>   know what to do with us because we were girls. It was pretty difficult for</br>   me to see that as a daughter and see my dad crying. I mean, he didn't want</br>   to go to work and we didn't have nothing to eat. We have family there, but,</br>   you know, sometimes the family doesn't help us too much. You have more from</br>   other people than the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you have to go to work so that you could eat?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I try to push my dad to go to work. And then, he started with</br>   work and he talk with his boss and I was going to work with him. We were</br>   cleaning the restaurant and I try to work with my dad like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that work out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was just cleaning the tables and just vacuum the lobby. That's all</br>   I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And when did you start doing that? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was like sixteen years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I didn't finish it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, tell me what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well I was almost finished; it was like two mouths to finish. But I</br>   didn't finish it because I'd see the problems with my dad and my mom, and I</br>   start to go out with my friends, and I was involved in a car accident. I</br>   wasn't driving, but I wasn't all up there, and I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Obviously you didn't have papers, but had you been drinking? Was</br>   there something that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We were drinking. I wasn't driving, but I was in the car, so they</br>   found alcohol.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Alcohol on the vehicle and it's like at the border.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hardly anything to be deported for, right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I know. I tried to stay there, but it was better for me to get</br>   deported than stay. I didn't want to be in jail. They tried to put me in</br>   jail for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Eighteen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You are eighteen.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I didn't want to be there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a lawyer?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did have a lawyer. The lawyer told me, “You have two options. You</br>   can stay in jail two months or you can go back to Mexico.” So, I just</br>   decide to go back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think your decision was influenced by the conflicts between</br>   your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was because when I got here, I went to school, but I didn't</br>   finish to study. I didn’t finish because of the economy problems. My dad</br>   didn't have money, my mom didn't have money, so I just decided to stop</br>   going to school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you made the decision to go, was it a voluntary—?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Interviewer. Were you given a limit as to when you could apply for a visa</br>   to go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, no, they never told me that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, you went alone? You got deported alone?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was pretty scared cause I didn't know. Once I get there, I got to</br>   Tijuana, and from there, I took a bus to here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there anyone here to greet you or welcome you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My family, my mom's family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your mom's family? Any government people?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, nothing like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you knew that you had family here that you could come to?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I do have family here that I can come to. But, you know, sometimes</br>   your family doesn't help too much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was fine, but I did have many problems with my family. Because I</br>   didn't have my parents here, and as I mentioned to you, they didn't have</br>   money to send me and sometimes they asked me for money to even eat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your parents did?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, my family. They didn't want me to eat their food.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I had to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what did you get? What kind of work could you get? You were</br>   eighteen right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I was working at a little place to make juice. We were making</br>   juice. I was working there, and then I heard about call centers. I started</br>   work there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you been working there ever since? How do you like that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I don't like that too much because I want to start studying.</br>   But then, I met a guy and I got married and I have kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How many kids?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I have two, but now I'm thinking on my kids. I'm not with him</br>   anymore and I am alone with my kids. So, it's pretty hard for me because I</br>   didn't want them to go through the same thing that my daddy and my mom</br>   went. And now for my kids, it's pretty hard to explain them that I'm not</br>   going to be with their dad anymore. That it's pretty hard for me even to</br>   take them to school because I have to work and sometimes my kids are</br>   telling me not to go to work. They cry a lot because they miss me because</br>   they don't see me too much. Call centers have a long time that you have to</br>   be working. But I mean there's no other way that I can go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does your family help out now? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well my mom helps me to take care of my babies.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She's back now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She's back now. She's taking care of my babies right now. But it's</br>   pretty difficult for her because now she's getting old and she is sick</br>   right now. So, she can’t take care of them pretty well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are they?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Five and three years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, the call center is tough, but is it enough to make a living for</br>   you and your children?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, it's not enough because sometimes I don't have money to take</br>   my kids to school because we have to pay like rent, we have to pay the</br>   lights that we have to pay, and we have to buy the things that we're going</br>   to eat. There's so many things that we have to do.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, looking back on your time in the US, do you think you're a</br>   different person because of your time in the US? Do you think that if you'd</br>   never gone you would be different than the way you are now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Sometimes from the experience, you learn so many things. So</br>   maybe if I didn't went through all the things that I went through, maybe I</br>   wasn't going to be the person that I am right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Art, Bullying, Discrimination">Anne: Are there things that you miss from the US?     Laura: Well, not really.     Anne: The things that you’re glad you don't have to deal with anymore in   the US?     Laura: People that make fun of you. [Chuckle].     Anne: So, you never sort of got over that. I mean you felt that a lot?     Laura: When I was in school, my English is not too better. It's not 100%,   and there's people that make fun of you.

How come?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was</br>   trying to teach me English—well she teach me English because I learned a</br>   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,</br>   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad</br>   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty</br>   lost at that time as well—I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the</br>   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty</br>   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us—she was</br>   coming back and she left us like three or four years. So I was in charge of</br>   my little sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a lot to put on someone.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he</br>   didn't want to go to work.

So, I was like, “What? What do I have? Or did I say something wrong?”</br>   But once I started to go to school, it was pretty difficult for me because</br>   I didn't understand some things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think if you were in charge of life and you could relive your</br>   life, would you send yourself to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Actually, on my mind, I want to go back there. I want to try to get</br>   a visa and I want to go back there again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To live or to visit?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I want to go live because I want my kids to have a better life. You</br>   know, Mexico City, I mean it's not the worst, but I don't want my kids to</br>   get involved in drug things, and stuff. And sometimes I just talk to my son</br>   and I talk about the life that I got there and the things that I was doing</br>   with my parents. He's like, “I want to go out there, mama.” I want to take</br>   him there. I want to show him, I want him to learn English, and he can</br>   study there. I want to go back. I think you can do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your little sister still there?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, she is here with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She came back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah.

And with your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: With my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Your dreams are really to somehow make enough money to go</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. My dreams is making money. I want to try to have a house for</br>   my kids. I want to finish my school. I want to finish a career as well. I</br>   mean, I have to be an example for my kid.

Everything is difficult because   you start to live a better life there, and once you have come here, you   have nothing. You don't even have a bed to sleep. The only thing that I   could say is that, if they're still on the United States, they can take   advantage of that and build a house, so they don't have to go to people   that they don't want them in their house. I mean to have something in your   life, you don't have to go through any other people, and ask them to help   you. Because people are never going to help you. Nobody is going to help   you if you don't make it w</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Laura: Yeah. My dreams is making money. I want to try to have a house for   my kids. I want to finish my school. I want to finish a career as well. I   mean, I have to be an example for my kid. He sees me that I finished my   school, my career, I think he will do it someday. I just want to do that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Family reunification">Laura: No, she is here with me.     Anne: She came back?     Laura: Yeah. All my family is back here.     Anne: Oh, they are all back.     Laura: They're back. Actually my dad was deported as well.     Anne: But your mom came back with you when you came back?     Laura: No.     Laura: She stayed there, and after three years she came back with us.     Anne: I see. And with your sister?     Laura: With my sister.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Crime and Violence">Laura: I want to go live because I want my kids to have a better life. You   know, Mexico City, I mean it's not the worst, but I don't want my kids to   get involved in drug things, and stuff. And sometimes I just talk to my son   and I talk about the life that I got there and the things that I was doing   with my parents. He's like, “I want to go out there, mama.” I want to take   him there. I want to show him, I want him to learn English, and he can   study there. I want to go back. I think you can do that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL, Bullying">Laura: When I was in school, my English is not too better. It's not 100%,   and there's people that make fun of you. So, I mean I try to do my best   but…    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being, Return to Mexico, Jobs, Call Centers">Laura: I have two, but now I'm thinking on my kids. I'm not with him   anymore and I am alone with my kids. So, it's pretty hard for me because I   didn't want them to go through the same thing that my daddy and my mom   went. And now for my kids, it's pretty hard to explain them that I'm not   going to be with their dad anymore. That it's pretty hard for me even to   take them to school because I have to work and sometimes my kids are   telling me not to go to work. They cry a lot because they miss me because   they don't see me too much. Call centers have a long time that you have to   be working. But I mean there's no other way that I can go.    </span> Anne: Does your family help out now? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well my mom helps me to take care of my babies.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She's back now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She's back now. She's taking care of my babies right now. But it's</br>   pretty difficult for her because now she's getting old and she is sick</br>   right now. So, she can’t take care of them pretty well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are they?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Five and three years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, the call center is tough, but is it enough to make a living for</br>   you and your children?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Economic well-being">Laura: Well, it's not enough because sometimes I don't have money to take   my kids to school because we have to pay like rent, we have to pay the   lights that we have to pay, and we have to buy the things that we're going   to eat. There's so many things that we have to do.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, New family formation">Laura: She's back now. She's taking care of my babies right now. But it's   pretty difficult for her because now she's getting old and she is sick   right now. So, she can’t take care of them pretty well.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work">Laura: Well, I was working at a little place to make juice. We were making   juice. I was working there, and then I heard about call centers. I started   work there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Return to Mexico, Family Relationships, Those who stayed in Mexico">Laura: It was fine, but I did have many problems with my family. Because I   didn't have my parents here, and as I mentioned to you, they didn't have   money to send me and sometimes they asked me for money to even eat.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Economic well-being, Continuing education">Laura: It was because when I got here, I went to school, but I didn't   finish to study. I didn’t finish because of the economy problems. My dad   didn't have money, my mom didn't have money, so I just decided to stop   going to school.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US, Court Proceedings, Lawyer">Laura: I did have a lawyer. The lawyer told me, “You have two options.

Laura: Alcohol on the vehicle and it's like at the border.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Homelife, Living situation">Laura: Well I was almost finished; it was like two mouths to finish. But I   didn't finish it because I'd see the problems with my dad and my mom, and I   start to go out with my friends, and I was involved in a car accident. I   wasn't driving, but I wasn't all up there, and I got deported.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Parents/step-parents">Laura: Well, I try to push my dad to go to work. And then, he started with   work and he talk with his boss and I was going to work with him. We were   cleaning the restaurant and I try to work with my dad like that.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family, Parents/step-parents">Laura: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he   didn't want to go to work. He was just in his room crying for my mom   watching TV. He didn't want us to see him like that. But I was the oldest   sister and I do remember when my dad just hugged me and cry about my mom   and say, “Why she left us? Why?” because we were girls. So, my dad didn't   know what to do with us because we were girls. It was pretty difficult for   me to see that as a daughter and see my dad crying. I mean, he didn't want   to go to work and we didn't have nothing to eat. We have family there, but,   you know, sometimes the family doesn't help us too much. You have more from   other people than the family.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Laura: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was   trying to teach me English—well she teach me English because I learned a   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty   lost at that time as well—I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us—she was   coming back and she left us like three or four years. So I was in charge of   my little sister.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Bullying, Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Laura: No, sometimes I was missing school like too many days because I did   not want to go and people making fun of me. There was many people, Mexican   people that speak Spanish to me, but I wasn't feeling comfortable when I go   to my classrooms and I don't have like friends that speak English and speak   Spanish. So it was very uncomfortable for me. I was pretty scared of doing   homework. I was pretty scared reading the book when the teacher told me to   read it. I was pretty lost. I didn't know what to do, so I was afraid to go   to school.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Learning English/ ESL">Laura: Not too much. I mean, I try to do my best but I don't know. I don't   even know how to start to learn English because I have Mexican people right   beside me and they didn't help me out. They didn't help me out. They didn't   let me know what there was saying. It was pretty difficult. But once I   start to learn English, well to start understanding just a little bit, I   just got involved to it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School">Laura: Well, it was summer, so it was pretty nice and I did like it, but   once I went to school, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.   I have teachers, and I didn't know what they were saying. It was pretty   difficult to us because we didn't know what to say, we didn't know what   they were telling us. It was pretty bad because there was people, like   Mexican people, that instead of helping you, they were just making fun of   you because you didn't know English.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Family Relationships">Laura: Guns. I mean, I was very afraid because of my sister. She was a   little girl. My dad was afraid as well. He just wanted to take us out of   there, but we have to wait like the twenty days. When we go to the bathroom   when we need, my dad took us to the bathroom. To eat, they only give us one   egg, and just a little piece of bread in the whole day. It was pretty much   the worst. And then, when my family takes us out, that person that would   take us out to another person, that person sit me in the front of the car.   And that person has a gun right beside me. I was pretty scared about it,   because I thought they were going to kill us or something. Once they took   us to the other person—the other person was pretty nice—he took us to his   house. He told us to take shower, to grab the food that we want. So, that   person was very nice with us. He give us food, we took a shower, and then   he took us to California where we supposed to be. So that person was pretty   nice. Then we got there, and we started to go to school.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing,  desert">And then, well I didn't know what time it was it, but we stopped eating   at the middle of the desert. We were eating tacos. Well my little sister   was, she was little. She was like three years old, and she was walking with   us. She was crying because she couldn't do it anymore. She wanted to… My   dad pulled her out. Just helped her out, he pulled her on his back, and he   continued walking with us. I was trying to be strong, because of my sister   who was little. And then, we saw the la migra, the police, immigration. We   go back, then we stay like lay down on the middle at the dessert.    </span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing">Laura: Then it got dark, and then it had started to rain. We were   walking—we didn't know where we are. We were walking, and we have some...   Well it was like a little mountain, I don't know how to say that, but it   was like a little fold. We were walking, like in a little line. And we went   with our cousins. One of my cousin was going to fall down. Then we got to   the line, we were walking. It was raining, it was dark. The only light that   we can see was the moonlight. We didn't have any light at all. We were   walking, then when we got to the... We saw the road, but I don't know where   we, exactly. We just lay down. That rain was getting to us. My little   sister was shaking, because she was cold. We didn't have any jackets. My   dad was very scared because my sister didn't answer, my sister fell asleep.   And she was shaking a lot, but she never answer. We tried to wake her up,   and she never answer. We're like, &quot;Oh, my God, what happened to her?&quot; But   then she wake up, and she said she was fine, that she was cold only.     Laura: We were with many other people. Then we stay there, we fall asleep,   then somebody wakes us up and tell us to run to a truck. We run to a truck,   and there was two people that were driving, and he sit me on the back. He   lay my sister down and my dad was outside on the back of the truck. Well,   they drive all to, I think it was Arizona. Then we get to one home, they   just remove us the shoes. We didn't have any shoes on. We went to a little   room, and there was many other people that were already crossed there. The   only thing that we have, it was like a little bit, they gave us food to   eat. We have it. So, we stayed there for like twenty days because they   didn't know—I mean, they didn't tell my other relatives, my family, how   much was going to be. So, we didn't have the money to take this, so we say   like twenty days there and there was people that have arms. We were   sleeping and there was somebody taking care of us, so we don't escape or, I   don't know, but they have arms, like huge arms.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Migration from Mexico, Border crossing">Laura: I went with my dad, only with my dad and my other sister, my little   sister. We went to Piedras Negras and then we found a person that was going   to cross us. That person, maybe he didn't know the exactly... road. We were   at the dessert at 4:00 AM. We take some gallons of water. We didn't have   like any other stuff, like water and food to eat. We start walking at 4:00   AM.

Did you see them? I</br>   mean was it kind of the thing where they weren't home a lot or did you get</br>   to see them a good bit?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well the only days that I got to see them was the days that they</br>   don't work, days off. Which was one day and it was a Monday I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you and your sister do on Saturday and Sunday?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, just staying home, watching TV because we were pretty afraid</br>   to go out because they were telling us that the police were going to take</br>   us if we didn't go to school, and there was many people that told us not to</br>   open the window and see what was outside because the police was going to</br>   come and take us. So we were just pretty afraid of it, and we just watching</br>   TV in our room and just waiting for my parents to come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, in high school when you started to feel more comfortable, did you</br>   make friends?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did make so many friends. I went out with them and it was more</br>   comfortable with them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you like high school or not?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You did? How come?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was</br>   trying to teach me English—well she teach me English because I learned a</br>   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,</br>   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad</br>   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty</br>   lost at that time as well—I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the</br>   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty</br>   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us—she was</br>   coming back and she left us like three or four years. So I was in charge of</br>   my little sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a lot to put on someone.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he</br>   didn't want to go to work. He was just in his room crying for my mom</br>   watching TV. He didn't want us to see him like that. But I was the oldest</br>   sister and I do remember when my dad just hugged me and cry about my mom</br>   and say, “Why she left us? Why?” because we were girls. So, my dad didn't</br>   know what to do with us because we were girls. It was pretty difficult for</br>   me to see that as a daughter and see my dad crying. I mean, he didn't want</br>   to go to work and we didn't have nothing to eat. We have family there, but,</br>   you know, sometimes the family doesn't help us too much. You have more from</br>   other people than the family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you have to go to work so that you could eat?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I try to push my dad to go to work. And then, he started with</br>   work and he talk with his boss and I was going to work with him. We were</br>   cleaning the restaurant and I try to work with my dad like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that work out?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was just cleaning the tables and just vacuum the lobby. That's all</br>   I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And when did you start doing that? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was like sixteen years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, did you finish high school?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I didn't finish it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, tell me what happened.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well I was almost finished; it was like two mouths to finish. But I</br>   didn't finish it because I'd see the problems with my dad and my mom, and I</br>   start to go out with my friends, and I was involved in a car accident. I</br>   wasn't driving, but I wasn't all up there, and I got deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Obviously you didn't have papers, but had you been drinking? Was</br>   there something that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: We were drinking. I wasn't driving, but I was in the car, so they</br>   found alcohol.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Alcohol on the vehicle and it's like at the border.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hardly anything to be deported for, right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I know. I tried to stay there, but it was better for me to get</br>   deported than stay. I didn't want to be in jail. They tried to put me in</br>   jail for two months.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Eighteen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You are eighteen.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I didn't want to be there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a lawyer?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I did have a lawyer. The lawyer told me, “You have two options. You</br>   can stay in jail two months or you can go back to Mexico.” So, I just</br>   decide to go back to Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think your decision was influenced by the conflicts between</br>   your parents?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was because when I got here, I went to school, but I didn't</br>   finish to study. I didn’t finish because of the economy problems. My dad</br>   didn't have money, my mom didn't have money, so I just decided to stop</br>   going to school.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you made the decision to go, was it a voluntary—?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Interviewer. Were you given a limit as to when you could apply for a visa</br>   to go back to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, no, they never told me that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And so, you went alone? You got deported alone?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I was pretty scared cause I didn't know. Once I get there, I got to</br>   Tijuana, and from there, I took a bus to here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was there anyone here to greet you or welcome you?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: My family, my mom's family.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your mom's family? Any government people?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, nothing like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you knew that you had family here that you could come to?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I do have family here that I can come to. But, you know, sometimes</br>   your family doesn't help too much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did that go?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: It was fine, but I did have many problems with my family. Because I</br>   didn't have my parents here, and as I mentioned to you, they didn't have</br>   money to send me and sometimes they asked me for money to even eat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your parents did?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, my family. They didn't want me to eat their food.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did you do?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I had to work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And what did you get? What kind of work could you get? You were</br>   eighteen right?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I was working at a little place to make juice. We were making</br>   juice. I was working there, and then I heard about call centers. I started</br>   work there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Have you been working there ever since? How do you like that?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I don't like that too much because I want to start studying.</br>   But then, I met a guy and I got married and I have kids.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How many kids?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I have two, but now I'm thinking on my kids. I'm not with him</br>   anymore and I am alone with my kids. So, it's pretty hard for me because I</br>   didn't want them to go through the same thing that my daddy and my mom</br>   went. And now for my kids, it's pretty hard to explain them that I'm not</br>   going to be with their dad anymore. That it's pretty hard for me even to</br>   take them to school because I have to work and sometimes my kids are</br>   telling me not to go to work. They cry a lot because they miss me because</br>   they don't see me too much. Call centers have a long time that you have to</br>   be working. But I mean there's no other way that I can go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Does your family help out now? Or no?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well my mom helps me to take care of my babies.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She's back now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She's back now. She's taking care of my babies right now. But it's</br>   pretty difficult for her because now she's getting old and she is sick</br>   right now. So, she can’t take care of them pretty well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are they?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Five and three years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, the call center is tough, but is it enough to make a living for</br>   you and your children?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, it's not enough because sometimes I don't have money to take</br>   my kids to school because we have to pay like rent, we have to pay the</br>   lights that we have to pay, and we have to buy the things that we're going</br>   to eat. There's so many things that we have to do.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, looking back on your time in the US, do you think you're a</br>   different person because of your time in the US? Do you think that if you'd</br>   never gone you would be different than the way you are now?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. Sometimes from the experience, you learn so many things. So</br>   maybe if I didn't went through all the things that I went through, maybe I</br>   wasn't going to be the person that I am right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Are there things that you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, not really.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The things that you’re glad you don't have to deal with anymore in</br>   the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: People that make fun of you. [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, you never sort of got over that. I mean you felt that a lot?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: When I was in school, my English is not too better. It's not 100%,</br>   and there's people that make fun of you. So, I mean I try to do my best</br>   but…</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So, when you came back to Mexico, was your Spanish still good?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, I was actually feeling so weird because there was many people</br>   that was staring at me—like I don't know why, but I feel like the look of</br>   me. So, I was like, “What? What do I have? Or did I say something wrong?”</br>   But once I started to go to school, it was pretty difficult for me because</br>   I didn't understand some things.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think if you were in charge of life and you could relive your</br>   life, would you send yourself to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Actually, on my mind, I want to go back there. I want to try to get</br>   a visa and I want to go back there again.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To live or to visit?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: I want to go live because I want my kids to have a better life. You</br>   know, Mexico City, I mean it's not the worst, but I don't want my kids to</br>   get involved in drug things, and stuff. And sometimes I just talk to my son</br>   and I talk about the life that I got there and the things that I was doing</br>   with my parents. He's like, “I want to go out there, mama.” I want to take</br>   him there. I want to show him, I want him to learn English, and he can</br>   study there. I want to go back. I think you can do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your little sister still there?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No, she is here with me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She came back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. All my family is back here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, they are all back.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: They're back. Actually my dad was deported as well.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But your mom came back with you when you came back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: No.</br> </br> </br>   Laura: She stayed there, and after three years she came back with us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. And with your sister?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: With my sister.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. Your dreams are really to somehow make enough money to go</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Yeah. My dreams is making money. I want to try to have a house for</br>   my kids. I want to finish my school. I want to finish a career as well. I</br>   mean, I have to be an example for my kid. He sees me that I finished my</br>   school, my career, I think he will do it someday. I just want to do that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: We're sort of finishing up. Is there anything you'd like to say that</br>   you haven't said yet, about your experiences as a returning migrant? Or</br>   living in the United States or the process that got you here?</br> </br> </br>   Laura: Well, I mean it's pretty difficult. Everything is difficult because</br>   you start to live a better life there, and once you have come here, you</br>   have nothing. You don't even have a bed to sleep. The only thing that I</br>   could say is that, if they're still on the United States, they can take</br>   advantage of that and build a house, so they don't have to go to people</br>   that they don't want them in their house. I mean to have something in your</br>   life, you don't have to go through any other people, and ask them to help</br>   you. Because people are never going to help you. Nobody is going to help</br>   you if you don't make it work.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
