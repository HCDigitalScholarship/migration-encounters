So I am <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span> and I wanted just to start by thanking you for</br>   coming to speak with us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: We are really grateful that you're willing to share your story.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Sure.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: We know it could be painful and I'm sorry if it gets painful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, okay. I don't really know. [Laughs nervously].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Anyways. So I was not at your survey so I'm not sure how your story</br>   started. So maybe you can start by just telling me what motivated you to go</br>   to the United States, how old you were, the circumstances, what it was like</br>   to go. For you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Okay. Well, I left when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five-and-a-half years old</span>. My mom</br>   wanted me to be here with her. She was already over there. We lived in</br>   California, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">East Palo Alto</span>. And she wanted…me and my brother actually went</br>   over there. We went through the car, though. We went through the line. So</br>   we didn't have to struggle going, jumping over the border. Nothing like</br>   that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Who was driving the car?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Her friend. My mom's friend. Yeah. They hired him to come and get</br>   us, pick us up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So yeah, when we got there, I don't know. Everything was weird. I</br>   didn't know where we were. I really don't remember much when I was young.</br>   But the language, I think I learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I learned in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span></br>   and a half. It wasn't very hard. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long had your mom been in the States before she asked you to</br>   come?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">About one year or</span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span>. I don't remember much. But, yeah. Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   years</span>. My uncle actually helped her get over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So did you remember her when you got there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Did I remember her? Man. No, I did remember her. Yeah, I did. I got</br>   very happy.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I went right away and hugged her.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Cool.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Had you been living with grandparents before then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. With my grandma, all my life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it hard to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well, young…I don't think that it hurt me like that. But when I got</br>   older, yeah. I thought about, &quot;Why did I leave her? Why?&quot; I should have</br>   been with her, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And was your dad there, too? In the States?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: My dad? No. My dad, he left when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like two</span>. But when I got</br>   there to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a</br>   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all. And we were</br>   living with him. Yeah. He was kind of... What do you call it? Kind of</br>   weird. Kind of demanding.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was he also <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: He wanted to take power…Yeah, from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>. From <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Puebla</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did he have papers or was he...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, he didn't. He didn't, either. I don't know how they met. But</br>   when we went, they were already together. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So he was hard on you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. He had another…he had a kid, too.</br>   So I had a step-brother. And he would treat him with a lot of power over</br>   her, demanding and shit. And he would try to do that with me and my brother</br>   but my brother wouldn't let it happen. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is your brother older?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Around like... Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> older than me. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So all <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> boys lived in the house together?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He</br>   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span> after we were over there,</br>   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four   years</span>, they separated</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Menlo Park</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">California</span>. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Kindergarten, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Then when I got over there, I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you said that you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span>. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">East Palo Alto</span> to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Menlo Park</span>? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around 12</span> when I moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Menlo Park</span>. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Woodside</span>. I moved to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Redwood   City</span>. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">11th</span> grade or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span> grade.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around eight years</span> old.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Eight years old</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: But when <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">the DACA DREAM Act</span>, when I got the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">DACA</span>, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So when did you apply for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">DACA</span>? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15, 16</span>. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Every two years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Every two</span>? Yeah, I think I only had it for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So when did you drop out? <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">11th</span> grade or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Eleventh</span>. Well no, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">12th</span> grade, around... I had like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>, I think.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: After that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, not really. So then, after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span>, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Palo Alto</span>. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So how did you end up back in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Guadalajara</span>. Then, from there, we went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Michoacán</span></br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Eighteen</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Around 18</span>. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you'd been out of school for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a couple years</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">maybe half a year</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">One year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it you just wanted to see <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> or...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How was your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Spanish</span> ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Probably <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">like 50%</span>. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. Only <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: So when I got here, no. I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Michoacán</span>, over there, for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one   year</span>. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking.

And then...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one year</span>. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">half a year</span>, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Michoacán</span>. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.

It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">all day</span>,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Now, I live in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tecámac</span>. In <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: From here, like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour and a half</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour and a half</span> on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">5:00 AM</span> to be able to get here at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">7:00 AM</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.

We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: The job?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well, I'm <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">one week</span> into it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Before that, I worked in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Workforce</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What is it you miss from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">East Palo   Alto</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Redwood City</span>, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">SF</span> bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think being in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So when you were living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">every day</span>. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">10</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">15</span> people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah. If they talk <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> getting better?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No. Getting better. I would probably say <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">80%</span> now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> with?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime</br>   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should</br>   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,</br>   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long has she been working in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: She's been over there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">like 18 years</span> now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What kind of work does she do there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: She does take, give keeper, like taking care of a old lady.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Oh! Caretaker.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that. She gets paid good.</br>   And my brother, he does painting.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Painting now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: In the painting company.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: He has his own?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: No, no. For a company. He works for a company. But they're just,</br>   they're doing good right now. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah. So thinking back on your own experiences, we're getting to the</br>   end of this interview. If you had something to conclude with, is there</br>   something you want to share with people about your own experiences in the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and coming back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Something that I would want to share?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: Good or bad or... I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Either. Either way. Just something that you haven't said thus far</br>   that helps people understand you and your experience.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Edgar</span>: To not be afraid to come back. I think you can live a good life here</br>   in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, too. And not worry about if you come back, you're not going to</br>   have a job, none of that. I think that you shouldn't worry about that. I</br>   think that, coming back here, you can make friends, too. You can have a new</br>   life. Yeah. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arriving in the United States, Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Family reunification, Border crossing, General, States, California">Edgar: Okay. Well, I left when I was five-and-a-half years old. My mom   wanted me to be here with her. She was already over there. We lived in   California, East Palo Alto. And she wanted…me and my brother actually went   over there. We went through the car, though. We went through the line. So   we didn't have to struggle going, jumping over the border. Nothing like   that.     Anne: Who was driving the car?     Edgar: Her friend. My mom's friend. Yeah. They hired him to come and get   us, pick us up.    </span> Edgar: So yeah, when we got there, I don't know. Everything was weird. I</br>   didn't know where we were. I really don't remember much when I was young.</br>   But the language, I think I learned English. I learned in a year, one year</br>   and a half. It wasn't very hard. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long had your mom been in the States before she asked you to</br>   come?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: About one year or two. I don't remember much. But, yeah. Like two</br>   years. My uncle actually helped her get over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you remember her when you got there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Did I remember her? Man. No, I did remember her. Yeah, I did. I got</br>   very happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I went right away and hugged her.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Cool.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been living with grandparents before then?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. With my grandma, all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, young…I don't think that it hurt me like that. But when I got</br>   older, yeah. I thought about, &quot;Why did I leave her? Why?&quot; I should have</br>   been with her, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And was your dad there, too? In the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My dad? No. My dad, he left when I was like two. But when I got</br>   there to California, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a</br>   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all. And we were</br>   living with him. Yeah. He was kind of... What do you call it? Kind of</br>   weird. Kind of demanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he also Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He wanted to take power…Yeah, from Puebla. From Puebla, Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have papers or was he...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, he didn't. He didn't, either. I don't know how they met. But</br>   when we went, they were already together. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he was hard on you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. He had another…he had a kid, too.</br>   So I had a step-brother. And he would treat him with a lot of power over</br>   her, demanding and shit. And he would try to do that with me and my brother</br>   but my brother wouldn't let it happen. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Around like... Yeah, two years older than me. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So all three boys lived in the house together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He</br>   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, one year after we were over there,</br>   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like four</br>   years, they separated</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Kindergarten, first grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Then when I got over there, I went to first grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in 11th grade or 12th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like around eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Eight years old?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Every two years.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you drop out? 11th grade or 12th?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eleventh. Well no, 12th grade, around... I had like one semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already 18, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: After that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Growing up undocumented">Edgar: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Dreams">Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good   paying job. Yeah.

Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).     Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get   paid. It all depends on me.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Jobs/employment/work">Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Detention, Juvenile">Edgar: No. No, I was already 18.

And then, we came here to check it out, me and my   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Drug Offenses">Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.     Anne: Drinking?

He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know   what to do. At all.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Jobs/employment/work, Occupations">Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were   in school?    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Immigration status, Lost opportunities">Edgar: Drop out?

And the homework, I didn't want to do it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Pastimes, Sports, Playing">Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie   theaters.

Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School">Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Making friends">Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely   got there too.

Then we found another apartment. We went from East   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Family">Edgar: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, one year after we were over there,   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Living undocumented">Edgar: So yeah, when we got there, I don't know. Everything was weird. I   didn't know where we were. I really don't remember much when I was young.   But the language, I think I learned English. I learned in a year, one year   and a half. It wasn't very hard. So, yeah.    </span> Anne: How long had your mom been in the States before she asked you to</br>   come?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: About one year or two. I don't remember much. But, yeah. Like two</br>   years. My uncle actually helped her get over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you remember her when you got there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Did I remember her?

I got</br>   very happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I went right away and hugged her.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Cool.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been living with grandparents before then?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. With my grandma, all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, young…I don't think that it hurt me like that. But when I got</br>   older, yeah. I thought about, &quot;Why did I leave her? Why?&quot; I should have</br>   been with her, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And was your dad there, too? In the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My dad? No. My dad, he left when I was like two. But when I got</br>   there to California, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a</br>   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all. And we were</br>   living with him. Yeah. He was kind of... What do you call it? Kind of</br>   weird. Kind of demanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he also Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He wanted to take power…Yeah, from Puebla. From Puebla, Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have papers or was he...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, he didn't. He didn't, either. I don't know how they met. But</br>   when we went, they were already together. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he was hard on you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. He had another…he had a kid, too.</br>   So I had a step-brother. And he would treat him with a lot of power over</br>   her, demanding and shit. And he would try to do that with me and my brother</br>   but my brother wouldn't let it happen. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Around like... Yeah, two years older than me. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So all three boys lived in the house together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He</br>   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, one year after we were over there,</br>   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like four</br>   years, they separated</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Kindergarten, first grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Then when I got over there, I went to first grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in 11th grade or 12th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like around eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Eight years old?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Every two years.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you drop out? 11th grade or 12th?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eleventh. Well no, 12th grade, around... I had like one semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already 18, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: After that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime</br>   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should</br>   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,</br>   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long has she been working in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She's been over there for like 18 years now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of work does she do there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She does take, give keeper, like taking care of a old lady.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh! Caretaker.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that. She gets paid good.</br>   And my brother, he does painting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Painting now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: In the painting company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He has his own?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. For a company. He works for a company. But they're just,</br>   they're doing good right now. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So thinking back on your own experiences, we're getting to the</br>   end of this interview. If you had something to conclude with, is there</br>   something you want to share with people about your own experiences in the</br>   US and coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Something that I would want to share?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Good or bad or... I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Either. Either way. Just something that you haven't said thus far</br>   that helps people understand you and your experience.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Best parts aboutbeing back, What Mexico has gained">Edgar: To not be afraid to come back.

And I didn't have that either.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Leaving the US">Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do   we do?

And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.     Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.     Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.     Anne: Selling weed?     Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.     Anne: Were you in a gang?     Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But   I never really got into that at all.     Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting   yourself?     Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,   yeah. He would help me out.

Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that   opportunity go.     Anne: Did your brother apply?     Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.   Yeah. Yeah.     Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?     Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than   without it.     Anne: And you had to stay in school.     Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.     Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you   still smoking weed?     Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for   that, DACA?     Anne: Every two years.     Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then.

That's when I found out.     Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...     Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.     Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?     Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart.

No. My dad, he left when I was like two. But when I got   there to California, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all.

The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.

Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language.

I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into...

I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much.

Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time.

We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime</br>   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should</br>   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,</br>   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long has she been working in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She's been over there for like 18 years now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of work does she do there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She does take, give keeper, like taking care of a old lady.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh! Caretaker.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that. She gets paid good.</br>   And my brother, he does painting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Painting now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: In the painting company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He has his own?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. For a company. He works for a company. But they're just,</br>   they're doing good right now. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So thinking back on your own experiences, we're getting to the</br>   end of this interview. If you had something to conclude with, is there</br>   something you want to share with people about your own experiences in the</br>   US and coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Something that I would want to share?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Good or bad or... I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Either. Either way. Just something that you haven't said thus far</br>   that helps people understand you and your experience.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: To not be afraid to come back. I think you can live a good life here</br>   in Mexico, too. And not worry about if you come back, you're not going to</br>   have a job, none of that. I think that you shouldn't worry about that. I</br>   think that, coming back here, you can make friends, too. You can have a new</br>   life. Yeah. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. Okay. Well thank you so much.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
