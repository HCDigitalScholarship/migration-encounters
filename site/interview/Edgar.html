Well, I left when I was five-and-a-half years old. My mom<br>
   wanted me to be here with her. She was already over there. We lived in<br>
   California, East Palo Alto. And she wanted…me and my brother actually went<br>
   over there. We went through the car, though. We went through the line. So<br>
   we didn't have to struggle going, jumping over the border. Nothing like<br>
   that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Who was driving the car?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Edgar: Her friend. My mom's friend. Yeah. They hired him to come and get<br>
   us, pick us up.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Edgar: So yeah, when we got there, I don't know. Everything was weird. I</br>   didn't know where we were. I really don't remember much when I was young.</br>   But the language, I think I learned English. I learned in a year, one year</br>   and a half. It wasn't very hard. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long had your mom been in the States before she asked you to</br>   come?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: About one year or two. I don't remember much. But, yeah. Like two</br>   years. My uncle actually helped her get over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you remember her when you got there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Did I remember her? Man. No, I did remember her. Yeah, I did. I got</br>   very happy.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I went right away and hugged her.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Cool.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Had you been living with grandparents before then?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. With my grandma, all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, young…I don't think that it hurt me like that. But when I got</br>   older, yeah. I thought about, &quot;Why did I leave her? Why?&quot; I should have</br>   been with her, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And was your dad there, too? In the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My dad? No. My dad, he left when I was like two. But when I got</br>   there to California, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a</br>   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all. And we were</br>   living with him. Yeah. He was kind of... What do you call it? Kind of</br>   weird. Kind of demanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he also Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He wanted to take power…Yeah, from Puebla. From Puebla, Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have papers or was he...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, he didn't. He didn't, either. I don't know how they met. But</br>   when we went, they were already together. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he was hard on you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. He had another…he had a kid, too.</br>   So I had a step-brother. And he would treat him with a lot of power over</br>   her, demanding and shit. And he would try to do that with me and my brother</br>   but my brother wouldn't let it happen. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Around like... Yeah, two years older than me. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So all three boys lived in the house together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He</br>   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, one year after we were over there,</br>   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like four</br>   years, they separated</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Kindergarten, first grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Then when I got over there, I went to first grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in 11th grade or 12th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like around eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Eight years old?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Every two years.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you drop out? 11th grade or 12th?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eleventh. Well no, 12th grade, around... I had like one semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already 18, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: After that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   <span id="de5b8d02-afa6-4348-bbd4-abe365e555bb" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Growing up undocumented">Edgar: Yeah, I think there should.

With my grandma, all my life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it hard to leave her?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, young…I don't think that it hurt me like that. But when I got</br>   older, yeah. I thought about, &quot;Why did I leave her? Why?&quot; I should have</br>   been with her, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And was your dad there, too? In the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My dad? No. My dad, he left when I was like two. But when I got</br>   there to California, my mom had already married another guy. So I had a</br>   stepdad. And it was kind of weird. I didn't know him at all. And we were</br>   living with him. Yeah. He was kind of... What do you call it? Kind of</br>   weird. Kind of demanding.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was he also Mexican?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He wanted to take power…Yeah, from Puebla. From Puebla, Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have papers or was he...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, he didn't. He didn't, either. I don't know how they met. But</br>   when we went, they were already together. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he was hard on you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. A little bit, a little bit. He had another…he had a kid, too.</br>   So I had a step-brother. And he would treat him with a lot of power over</br>   her, demanding and shit. And he would try to do that with me and my brother</br>   but my brother wouldn't let it happen. So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your brother older?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Around like... Yeah, two years older than me. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So all three boys lived in the house together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well the other kid, he would only come on the weekends. Yeah. He</br>   would live with his mom. Yeah. And then, one year after we were over there,</br>   he got married to my mom. And, yeah. That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like four</br>   years, they separated</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Kindergarten, first grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Then when I got over there, I went to first grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in 11th grade or 12th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like around eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Eight years old?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Every two years.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you drop out? 11th grade or 12th?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eleventh. Well no, 12th grade, around... I had like one semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already 18, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: After that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime</br>   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should</br>   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,</br>   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long has she been working in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She's been over there for like 18 years now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of work does she do there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She does take, give keeper, like taking care of a old lady.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh! Caretaker.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that. She gets paid good.</br>   And my brother, he does painting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Painting now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: In the painting company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He has his own?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. For a company. He works for a company. But they're just,</br>   they're doing good right now. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So thinking back on your own experiences, we're getting to the</br>   end of this interview. If you had something to conclude with, is there</br>   something you want to share with people about your own experiences in the</br>   US and coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Something that I would want to share?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Good or bad or... I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Either. Either way. Just something that you haven't said thus far</br>   that helps people understand you and your experience.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="5c904aed-8b00-4896-85c1-a26bd22c1f77" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Best parts aboutbeing back, What Mexico has gained">Edgar: To not be afraid to come back.

That was even more weird, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they have any children together?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They didn't. They didn't. They didn't. But, yeah, after like four</br>   years, they separated</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Because it wasn't working. The relationship.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So he moved out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: He moved out. Then we found another apartment. We went from East</br>   Palo Alto to Menlo Park, California. Then, yeah. I had to change schools.</br>   Everything. Everything changed. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you came over. You were about, you said, five or six when you came</br>   over?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Around five.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, you started school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you said it was pretty easy to learn the language.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I went to elementary or middle. Elementary, right?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. You were just a kid.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Kindergarten, first grade, something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, I went to kindergarten here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Then when I got over there, I went to first grade. And then, my</br>   teacher, I really liked her. Because she really helped me learn the</br>   language and all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there other children like you who had grown up elsewhere and</br>   were trying to learn English? Or did you feel pretty...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I think there were like five other people like me. They barely</br>   got there too. They were trying to learn the language. So that really</br>   helped me a lot too, that there were other people like me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you enjoy school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did, I did. I really did. I liked going a lot. I wouldn't miss one</br>   day. But then, yeah. When I got older, I went to high school, I didn't like</br>   going anymore.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were a kid, and you liked it. And you...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I liked it. And then, I didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). What did you like about school as a kid?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I liked…I really liked learning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I really liked writing, learning, learning new stuff that I didn't</br>   know. And I liked the environment that I had with friends. And I liked the</br>   food. I liked it a lot. I liked the library, too. Because I love to read.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do anything like sports or art or music or anything like</br>   that?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: We were doing art. And then, around middle school, I did the</br>   saxophone.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh!</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: And drums. Yeah. I really liked it a lot, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Then as I grew up, everything went away.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you said that you were six. You had this stepfather character. And</br>   then, they got married. And then, they got separated. So when did you have</br>   to move from East Palo Alto to Menlo Park? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we were moving back and forth, back and forth. But I was like</br>   around 12 when I moved to Menlo Park. And then, from there, I went to</br>   Hillview Middle School. Finished that, went to Woodside. I moved to Redwood</br>   City. That way, we could be closer to high school. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what made you stop liking school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Just got into... Well my friends, they were into another type of</br>   environment. We were more into ditching and going out, having fun,</br>   partying. And I followed them. And, yeah. I wouldn't like to go anymore.</br>   But that happened in 11th grade or 12th grade.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were almost done.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did you get in trouble?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, I got in trouble. I was doing weed at that time.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So I only wanted to do that the whole day. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what was home life like with your mom and stepfather for a while?</br>   And then, not stepfather? Did you guys have a lot of family time? Did you</br>   go out and do stuff? Parks? Or was your mom working?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They were working a lot but they made a little bit of time. We</br>   would go to the park, play a little bit of soccer, and go to the movie</br>   theaters. But when they separated, I think we were happier without him.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you</br>   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I</br>   was like around eight years old.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Eight years old?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting</br>   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.</br>   That's when I found out.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that</br>   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were</br>   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I</br>   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped</br>   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I</br>   didn't. I didn't do that, either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me</br>   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that</br>   opportunity go.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did your brother apply?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.</br>   Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my</br>   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than</br>   without it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And you had to stay in school.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you</br>   still smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew</br>   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for</br>   that, DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Every two years.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't</br>   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So why'd you drop out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Drop out? I wouldn't call it drop out. I just... Yeah, the weed. It</br>   got me more into hanging out with my friends. And they didn't go either. So</br>   I would want to hang out with them more often. And if I did go, I wouldn't</br>   have that much time. And the homework, I didn't want to do it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when did you drop out? 11th grade or 12th?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eleventh. Well no, 12th grade, around... I had like one semester</br>   left. So, yeah. I dropped out. And I really regret that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was your mother mad at you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Not mad, but...well, yeah, mad, but she told me that I'm going to do</br>   whatever I'm going to do. I was already 18, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So, yeah. But yeah, she got mad at me. She wanted me to go back.</br>   Yeah, she wanted me to go back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what did you do after you dropped out of school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: After that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stopped. You didn't drop out. You just stopped going.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got</br>   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,</br>   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a</br>   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started</br>   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Selling weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you in a gang?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But</br>   I never really got into that at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting</br>   yourself?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he</br>   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,</br>   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would</br>   give it to me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you have a girlfriend?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: A girlfriend? I had a few. Yeah, a few. Yeah. I had a few.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Any kids?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. No, no, no, no. I don't have any right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how did you end up back in Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't</br>   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoacán</br>   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going</br>   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after</br>   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, &quot;Damn. Now what do</br>   we do? Now that we can't go back.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old were you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Eighteen. Around 18. When I got here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you'd been out of school for a couple years?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. No, not a couple. Like maybe half a year. One year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And your time in the plumbing business had been also while you were</br>   in school?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, that would be apart.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I see. So after you left school, you started plumbing?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And then, soon after, you came back here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it you just wanted to see Mexico or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A vacation?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well I didn't really think I had a future out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Because I didn't have the DACA anymore. To work a real job, I</br>   needed the social security. And I didn't have that either.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What about your dad? Or your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My brother?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. I mean, he was working a real job, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did he have a social security number?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, he had one. But you know how they get a fake one?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah. He had a fake one. I could've got that one, too. But I</br>   didn't really feel motivated that much out there to work. And then, the</br>   rent. Really, really high. Everything. I thought about, I thought if I came</br>   here, it would be way better for me. But when I got here, I didn't know</br>   what to do. At all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How was your Spanish ability when you got here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Probably like 50%. Yeah. Out there, I wouldn't really talk much like</br>   that, Spanish. Only English with my friends.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you got here, what'd you do?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: So when I got here, no. I went to Michoacán, over there, for one</br>   year. Me and my friend were pretty much hanging out, going to clubs. And we</br>   were getting money. He was getting money from his mom, I was getting money</br>   from my brother. And yeah, we were doing that for one year.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. We only drank beer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Drinking?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Only drinking.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Was it fun?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Pretty much. We were renting a house. Yeah. When I got here, I</br>   haven't done really, I haven't really done weed or nothing like that. Only</br>   drinking. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I'm 22.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you spent a year sort of having fun. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, one year. And then, we came here to check it out, me and my</br>   friend. Yeah. We wanted to check it out. And then, we were here for like</br>   half a year, half a year, hanging out, too. Drinking, meeting new people.</br>   Then we went back to Michoacán. And then, I got tired of it over there. So</br>   I came with my grandma. I told her. I called her and asked her if I can go</br>   live with her. She told me, &quot;Yeah. I can go.”</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you were in Mexico City?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Well not here. State. Mexico State. Ecatepec. And yeah, I went</br>   to go live with her. Got a little bit of depression. Because I didn't know.</br>   I didn't have a job, I didn't have nothing. I was getting fat.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You're not fat now.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, no, no. I go to the gym now. But, yeah. We were doing that.</br>   And then...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you miss your family?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did. I do, a lot. Yeah. My brother and my mom. A lot, a lot. Well</br>   I talk to them like every day, through the phone. But, yeah. I do want to</br>   go hug them, be with them, and all that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you have any marks against you in the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like criminal marks against you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No. What do you call them? Dismeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Misdemeanor. Yeah. I don't have any felonies, though.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. But a misdemeanor for...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: For weed, for getting caught with weed. Dealing and having...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh. I see.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I've been to juvie jail. I've been to juvie for half a year</br>   for violating my probation.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: After? Because you were smoking weed?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Like 10th grade, I got probation for bringing weed to</br>   the school. And, yeah. I had court, went through all that, got half a year</br>   in juvie. And then, never went back. But then, I went to jail. I went to</br>   jail but not for that much. Only for one week for being drunk.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Public drunkenness?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Public, yeah. Yeah. But I never had to bail out, nothing like</br>   that. Nothing big. Nothing big at all.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you served your time in jail and then got out?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And they never got you? ICE never came to get you?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you a minor at the time?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: When I went to...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Jail.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I was already 18. Yeah. No, if I was a minor, they would</br>   have took me to juvie, I think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Juvie, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Juvie. Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's possible that you could go back, if you ever wanted to?</br>   You're not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, I don't know. I don't know. What do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, how would I do that?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, I guess you get a visa and go. But probably, you need to</br>   like...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I mean, people here are telling me that you have to live a long time</br>   here in Mexico to apply.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well if you're deported. But you weren't.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. No, I didn't get deported.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: No. No. But you went to live with your grandma, and you started</br>   to...maybe it hit you that...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. It hit me that...</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You can't go back.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: That I'm actually here, that I can't go back at all. I have no way</br>   to go back. I can't get on an airplane and go back. I really do kinda want</br>   to go back. But not to live. Only to visit. Yeah. I kinda want to live here</br>   now, for now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: My life. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what pulled you out of the depression?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: What pulled me out? I think pretty much going to the gym,</br>   going…finding out about New Comienzos. I came here to talk to them. And</br>   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought</br>   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me</br>   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment</br>   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,</br>   eating. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So where do you live now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Now, I live in Tecámac. In Mexico.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And how far away from here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: From here, like an hour and a half.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And who do you live with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I live with my grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, still with your grandma.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: She must be happy that you're happier.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Really happy. She got really happy when I got there. But I</br>   really help her out a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So it's an hour and a half on it. Do you take a bus or a train or a…?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, I take a bus. It could take more if there's traffic. But I'm</br>   actually planning on getting a little car. That way, it won't have to be</br>   that much. Because where I work now, I have to leave—from where I live—I</br>   have to leave at 5:00 AM to be able to get here at 7:00 AM.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And where do you work?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I work here at EG Logistics.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I work there for right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it a call center?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. It's Logistic.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. We help truckers find a load.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it good?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: The job?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well, I'm one week into it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, okay.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Before that, I worked in Workforce.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: As a volunteer.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Volunteer?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. I volunteered before.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we'll see how this EG works, right?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Hopefully, it'll be good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Hopefully, it will be good.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Well we get paid with commission so I don't know how much we get</br>   paid. It all depends on me.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That sounds great.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What is it you miss from the US?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, man. All my people out there. The food. Where I lived, East Palo</br>   Alto, Redwood City, the SF bridge. Everything. Everything. Yeah. Pretty</br>   much everything. Everything from out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US made you a different person? Do you</br>   think you've changed here?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think it did, yeah. I think I'm different. I'm not really... I'm</br>   Mexican but I have a different mindset, now that I lived over there. I</br>   think that gave me pretty much a good opportunity advantage. I think</br>   differently than people here. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how so? Give me an example.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like I know more stuff of over there than people over here know. I</br>   know... What could I tell you? I don't know. It's just different, different</br>   than if I were, if I didn't go over there. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So when you were living in the US, you said you came back here</br>   because you didn't see any future in the US.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So you didn't have any dreams? Or you just figured they were not...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I did have a few dreams but I didn't think I would be able to</br>   accomplish them over there. I think I would be able to accomplish them</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are the dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: They were pretty much graduating high school. It got kind of hard</br>   over there. And here, I'm trying to graduate high school. And then, go to</br>   college. And then, I'm trying to, I don't know when I'm trying to graduate,</br>   but I want to graduate. And my dreams are probably, live the American life.</br>   Have a good car, have a wife. All that. And I didn't think I would be able</br>   to do that over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So have you gotten back to school yet? Or are you in the process of</br>   trying to do it?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I'm trying to right now, yeah. I'm trying to go back. But I don't</br>   know how to go. And then, what papers I have to take or anything like that.</br>   I don't know if they would evaluate the papers or if I would have to start</br>   it all over. I don't know. I don't know any of that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So New Comienzos might be able to help you with that.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: I think they might. Yeah. I haven't really gotten into it that much.</br>   But I'm going to. Yeah, I'm going to do that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Well that's good.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Now I feel more motivated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So have you made friends here? Is it harder to make friends</br>   or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: It's pretty, more hard than out there. Out there, I would meet a lot</br>   of people. I would meet new people every day, every day. But here, it's</br>   hard. I only know like 10, 15 people. Yeah. I only talk to people that talk</br>   English.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, really?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah. If they talk Spanish, they're like, I don't really hang out</br>   with them a lot. Yeah. Because I can't... Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is your Spanish getting better?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No. Getting better. I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I</br>   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy. What happened to your</br>   buddy that you came back to Mexico with?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Him? He actually went back. I don't know how he did it, but he</br>   actually went back. We keep in contact. We actually do keep in contact. I</br>   haven't asked him how he did it. But he went back. He's working over there</br>   now. He has a girlfriend, all that. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's hard. Hard.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Hard? I don't know. I'm living good right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Yeah. I mean, it's hard to go over. And then...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh! Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: And be wary of the authorities and...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yep. Yeah, yeah, yeah. I keep hearing from my friends that a lot of</br>   stuff changed out there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So your dreams are basically, get a good education.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Get a good education, yeah. Help my family out. Get a good job, good</br>   paying job. Yeah. I would want to go back with my mom and brother again.</br>   Hopefully, that can happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think much about immigration policy and what the US should do</br>   differently?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Like what? Like what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Like right now, it's tough for your mom and your brother. I mean,</br>   they don't have legal papers.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Oh, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I mean, do you think about maybe there should be changes to</br>   immigration policy over there, or...</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Yeah, I think there should. But I don't think there will be anytime</br>   soon. But I really think there should be. They should... Yeah. They should</br>   help people like my mom, people that have been over there for a long time,</br>   to give them help, to be able to actually work there. And, yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long has she been working in the States?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She's been over there for like 18 years now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What kind of work does she do there?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: She does take, give keeper, like taking care of a old lady.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh! Caretaker.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that. She gets paid good.</br>   And my brother, he does painting.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Painting now?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: In the painting company.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: He has his own?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: No, no. For a company. He works for a company. But they're just,</br>   they're doing good right now. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. So thinking back on your own experiences, we're getting to the</br>   end of this interview. If you had something to conclude with, is there</br>   something you want to share with people about your own experiences in the</br>   US and coming back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Something that I would want to share?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: Good or bad or... I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Either. Either way. Just something that you haven't said thus far</br>   that helps people understand you and your experience.</br> </br> </br>   Edgar: To not be afraid to come back. I think you can live a good life here</br>   in Mexico, too. And not worry about if you come back, you're not going to</br>   have a job, none of that. I think that you shouldn't worry about that. I</br>   think that, coming back here, you can make friends, too. You can have a new</br>   life. Yeah. I don't know.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Great. Okay. Well thank you so much.</br> </div><\p>
