I started my changes, I am a man.  I have always been a man. I am more healthy mentally, I feel amazing and blessed. Now with a beautiful family. A gorgeous wife, <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Josselin</span> and a handsome son <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Emir</span>. I am <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: One of the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> questions we have is why did your family migrate</br>   to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Basically, my family was in danger due to my dad's job, so we had to</br>   leave and move to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Your dad never talked to you about what happened?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: He did. He told me that since he was a lawyer, he had to do his job</br>   and kick someone out of a property. When he did that, another person was</br>   like, &quot;Hey, I need you to kick this person out of this property.&quot; And it</br>   was a big offer and he offered to pay in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> money. He did more</br>   research on it, even it sounds crazy to me, and he noticed that this person</br>   worked for the mafia here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. And my dad refused and <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">several months</span></br>   he was being harassed. Even came to the point where finally he came in</br>   danger too, even his life, our lives, was threatened. Our lives were</br>   threatened and that's when we moved to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What does your family leave behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Well mostly family here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you remember your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> day in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: To be honest, no I don't [Laughs]. I was too young.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How about your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> memory?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Was in school actually, in elementary school. I remember going there</br>   and not knowing a lot of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> at all. I remember not understanding</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, but somehow I managed and learned <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> fluently.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Were there any teachers that really stuck in your mind that you</br>   still remember that you still think about?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes. Oh yes. Yes I do. I think in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">around 2000</span>, I had, I think, a</br>   teacher named Ms. <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Walker</span> in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Corpus Christi</span>. She was really, really sweet. I</br>   loved how she taught. I would learn so quickly with her. She was one of my</br>   favorite teachers. That's one of the teachers I do remember.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What was your overall experience in school in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I think it was a little bit normal, like you see in movies and</br>   stuff. Of course, I wasn't you know, bullied or anything. We all have those</br>   gossips and everything around high school. But I really liked it, going to</br>   high school in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. It is what I've known.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Were you involved in any school activities?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah. I was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">JROTC</span>, which is kind of like a glimpse into the air</br>   force or whichever military branch the school had. So it was pretty neat. I</br>   turned out to be the physical trainer commander. I had a lot of ribbons. I</br>   had a lot of fun. I still remember my instructors, which were Major <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Han</span> and</br>   Sergeant <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Hardy</span>. It was great. We traveled, we went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Washington, D.C.,</span></br>   came back. So had a lot of opportunities there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So, what kind of values did you get from that experience? What do</br>   you think really stuck with you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Discipline. Teamwork. It brought me out of my shell. Before I was</br>   super quiet, not talkative, it was really hard for me to talk. Going to</br>   JROTC helped me a lot to break out of my shell and experience new things,</br>   talk to new people, all that good stuff.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: I think earlier you mentioned that you didn't know you were</br>   undocumented until at some point. When was that point and what was that</br>   process?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: When I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: When you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">18</span>? So this was after you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">JROTC</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: No. Yeah, this is after all that stuff. I didn't really know. People</br>   would say I looked too young for my age. And I started to believe it. I'm</br>   like &quot;Am I really this age?&quot; And then I looked through documents and I was</br>   like, &quot;Hey dad, where is my birth certificate, my documents?&quot; So he's like,</br>   &quot;Oh, it's right there above my desktop and everything.” I looked and I was</br>   like, &quot;Oh snap, I am this age then. This is interesting.&quot; And I was like,</br>   &quot;Oh, what is this place?&quot; And they were like, &quot;That's the... Where you were</br>   born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. You were born there, you were born in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> in that</br>   hometown.&quot; And it's like, &quot;Hey.&quot; Yeah, before that I was kind of oblivious</br>   to where I was born because it didn't really come to mind. It didn't worry</br>   me or was not a priority in my world. My priority was friends, living a</br>   normal life over there, looking for a job or going to school or doing all</br>   that kind of stuff. My significant other. But that wasn't really on my</br>   mind.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So was it a struggle to kind of be in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">JROTC</span>? It's like a very like</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> thing to do.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: No, it wasn't a struggle. It came like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> nature to me to be in</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">JROTC</span>. It was really sweet, awesome to be there and to be a part of</br>   something bigger than yourself.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And when they found out did that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It sort of crushed me because I was like, well in my mindset I</br>   was... It was a bittersweet thing. I was like, &quot;Oh, okay. I'm not only</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span>, but I'm also now <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican American</span>.” So it was a little bit to</br>   adapt to it. It explains why I speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> and maybe this, and why my mom</br>   cooked certain foods than other <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> friends do. So it was, I guess the</br>   best of both worlds you can say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Do you ever think about joining the military?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Here or over there?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Over there from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">JROTC</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I did think about it, but it was like, &quot;No, I'll probably get</br>   deployed and miss my family too much.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So did you work in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What was your favorite job and what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: My favorite job, well that's an easy one. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Abercrombie and Fitch</span>, I</br>   worked there as a model impact. Basically, what you do is you wear their</br>   clothes, you model for them, and you are in retail. So you go ahead and</br>   sell clothes, sell the clothes, so help the customer out, customer service</br>   as well as put up the clothes when they shipped in. When you ship them in,</br>   you get them in boxes, open the boxes, separate the guys and the girls, so</br>   on and so forth. Pretty easy job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How about the least favorite thing about <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: People discriminate too much against the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> and other foreign</br>   country people. If you're from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Arabia</span> or if you from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Spain</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> or</br>   anything like that, they'll look down on you a little bit. But they're not</br>   noticing that their origin is also from somewhere else. We just keep ours a</br>   little bit more alive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What are some of your favorite things in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, like your best</br>   experiences?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I mean they have big parties but comparing here to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, it kind</br>   of doesn't compare. I mean <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Houston</span>'s beautiful. It has its beauties, but to</br>   be honest I felt pretty closed in, a little bit claustrophobic. I was</br>   limited to what I can do to with myself and what I can do with my life</br>   until I came here. Here I feel a little bit more like I can breathe. I have</br>   more opportunities here than I did over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: I guess coming back to the racism that you mentioned, did you ever</br>   have an experience that you faced that discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Not particularly. I’ve seen other people a little bit. The only time</br>   I've seen it for myself is when I got deported, went to court, went through</br>   all that. I had to go ahead, and they had to believe someone else other</br>   than myself. So kind of kept looking at me like I didn't belong there, when</br>   I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: About how you returned to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. Can you tell me more about what</br>   happened and what led to the process?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Like my journey here or like how I traveled here or how?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What was the whole incident that led to you being arrested and then</br>   being deported and what happened during that? What happened after that?</br>   Kind of walk me through it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Basically, to summarize it a little bit, I got into the wrong crowd</br>   when I was partying a lot—this happened after a breakup. I found someone at</br>   a frat party, a house party with a lot of people there. You know how frat</br>   parties are. Basically, I didn't know the girl at the time, and we became</br>   close, but later realized she's not a very good person to be around with.</br>   It was like, &quot;You know what? This isn't very good. I have to stop hanging</br>   out with you. I'm sorry, can't be friends can't hang out. I have to delete</br>   you from my life basically.&quot; I blocked her on everything. She did not like</br>   that. She came back to the point where basically she told people that I did</br>   something to her that I didn't. For <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> I fought the case, but they saw</br>   me as “Well, foreign person, we'll just kick them out, whatever.” And</br>   that's when <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> just came to power as a president. So I'm like, &quot;Oh</br>   great, that's not good for me.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So, at what point in the process did <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> come to power?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It was by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the end of the year of maybe 2017,</span> 18 , when he came to</br>   power. I'm guessing. I don't remember.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Where were you in the process?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I was going to court and that's when they're like, &quot;Oh, okay, well</br>   things have changed a little bit. This means that you're going to have to</br>   go to jail for this for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 days</span>.&quot; When I did, I fought it as best as I</br>   could. But after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the year</span> I couldn't anymore. No one was there. My dad was</br>   at work. My current girlfriend at that point was coming from school to</br>   where I was. So I was just sitting there. They were like, &quot;Okay, just sit</br>   here.&quot; I was in the court room and they were like, &quot;Okay, well we need your</br>   stuff, your cell phone, everything.&quot; So I gave him my stuff. They put them</br>   in a baggie.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: They took me in the back door. They put me in a holding cell to go</br>   to jail. Of course, going to jail wasn't so fun. I was there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 days</span>.</br>   It was pretty difficult because I couldn't see my family, couldn't see my</br>   significant other or anything. I would talk to them on the phone, but</br>   surprisingly that was the hardest part. The easiest part was when I went to</br>   the immigration.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: This was the immigration detention center?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah, the holding cell is totally different. They wake you up like</br>   at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">three o'clock in the morning</span>, I was like half asleep and then they were</br>   like, &quot;Okay, well sign this.&quot; They make you sign.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: What I remember was they can only hold you for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">24 hours</span> after the</br>   time that you're supposed to leave. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">ICE</span> usually has a hold on you so that</br>   you can't get out and that time expired and they made me sign something. At</br>   that point I was half asleep so I didn't know what was going on. So, me</br>   signing it told them that, “Yes, it's okay to take me to the immigration</br>   place.” So from there it was really cold. They took me, and in the holding</br>   cell was terrible. They would treat you like you're a criminal, you didn't</br>   belong there. They held you in this little cell, like bathrooms and</br>   everything. It was really small. I was like, if you go to the zoo and you</br>   see like an animal just sitting there, it's basically that size. Finally,</br>   when I got my clothes, I changed, went to the detention center, which is a</br>   different facility, different building.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: That's when everything started to fall in place. I felt lighter on</br>   my feet. I still miss my family, but they're a little bit more crushed than</br>   I was. Finally, my time there came to an end. They woke me up <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">one morning</span></br>   and I got to leave. I went ahead and left. They put me in a van. In the van</br>   it was pretty hot. The women will be in one side and the men will be in the</br>   back side and there'll be like a gate in the middle so we won't do anything</br>   to each other or they won't hurt us. So they separated the men from the</br>   women. When it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">about what, five, four hours</span> to get to [foreign</br>   language, location].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: That's where?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah, that's when they were like, &quot;Oh, we're here.&quot; They threw the</br>   food at the ground and threw our stuff at the ground so we can pick it up.</br>   And they were like, &quot;Okay, well there's a border, walk.&quot; And we will have</br>   to pick up our food from the ground and walk over there and they will have</br>   their guns. So if anyone would try to turn around and go back to the border</br>   to the US border, they will shoot you. So, I was like, &quot;Well, I don't want</br>   to go back over there.&quot; So, I went ahead and just took my stuff, left, and</br>   they greeted me with like open arms to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So before you got to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, how long was it while you were in the</br>   detention facility?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 to 12 days</span>, I believe.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And before that you were in the holding cell you said?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Affirmative noise].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How long were you in the holding cell?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: For me, it felt for eternity, but it was like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">five, six, seven   hours</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Five, six, seven hours</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">Five to seven hours</span>, between that. You lose time because you don't</br>   have a clock or anything in there. So you don't know.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: And the conditions where you were being held?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: So poor, it was poor. There was writings on the wall, there was</br>   toilet paper, piss everywhere. Excrement. I mean they didn't really clean</br>   that well in the holding cell. They cleaned more in the detention center</br>   than the holding cell. The thing that I've noticed was actually, when they</br>   would detain people, I would see that the guards there would be like, &quot;Hey</br>   look, this is nice belt. You want to keep it?&quot; They would keep the stuff</br>   that they would take from the immigrants. So I'll be like, &quot;Okay, that's</br>   kind of messed up. That's not yours, that's theirs.&quot; But I couldn't really</br>   do anything.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: The other thing that I found out was they added actually felonies to</br>   my thing, to have an actual reason to deport me. When I went to court, I</br>   saw that they were like, &quot;Oh, I see that you got deported before.&quot; I'm</br>   like, &quot;No, I never got deported before. That's when I was in court before I</br>   got deported.’ And they were like, &quot;Yeah, I see here. You were deported</br>   before when you were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years old</span>.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;No, I was not. I would</br>   have remembered that.&quot; And of course the person opposite that wanted me out</br>   would be like, &quot;Well yeah, maybe you were too young to remember.&quot; I was</br>   kind of mad. So I was like, &quot;I'm pretty sure I would remember that. It's</br>   kind of traumatizing for a kid to get deported, even for an adult it's</br>   traumatizing.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: The judge was like, &quot;So, she got deported at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">four years old</span>? And</br>   crossed the border back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, like crossing the desert and all?&quot;</br>   They're like, &quot;Yeah, you got deported.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;No, I would have</br>   remembered a terrible desert and being hungry and sick and maybe, you know,</br>   I would remember that. That's traumatizing for a kid. No, I never been</br>   deported.&quot; So, they were like, &quot;Okay, well whatever&quot; [Weak chuckle]. I was</br>   like, &quot;All right, well that makes no sense but okay.&quot; But then I got even</br>   more angry because they were trying to get rid of me. I was like, &quot;Okay,</br>   well I just want my deportation order, just give me my deportation.&quot; They</br>   were like, &quot;Okay, we'll get you your deportation.&quot; That was it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So at the end of the day. Was it a voluntary departure or was it, a</br>   deportation order?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I think it was both in a way [Chuckle].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: A little bit of both?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah, because I didn't want to stay there any longer and I didn't</br>   want to stay there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span> to fight the case. I'm just going to be like,</br>   “You know what, whatever. Just deport me for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span>. I'm not able to go</br>   back for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span>, well <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine more years</span>.” So, I'm like, “Okay, whatever.</br>   I'll just live my life.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: When you returned to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, you mentioned you had a warm welcome.</br>   What was that like when you walked in [foreign language, location]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: It was like my world just turned upside down for the better. It was</br>   something different. It was like seeing the light at the end of the tunnel</br>   to be honest. Seeing something... People, so warming, so welcoming, people</br>   that will actually want... Feeling wanted in a place. It was different for</br>   me than living in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I didn't feel, basically, wanted there. I would</br>   have to look for it in people themselves. But feeling wanted in a place</br>   that is all around you, it's something amazing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: What made it so? What kind of things happened as soon as you walked</br>   in?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: They gave me food. They took care of me. They had a smile on their</br>   face. They made me feel like I was an actual person and I didn't feel that</br>   for a while.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You didn't feel it in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: No, I felt out of place in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I know people are, &quot;Oh, it's the</br>   big dream.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Yeah, but it's not the same as here.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So, when you were welcomed, they gave you food, they gave you</br>   water. What happened after that? What was the transition like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I called my dad, told them where I was. They gave me my papers.</br>   Basically, they guide you through everything. So basically, they were like,</br>   “Okay, well give me your name, give me all this, we'll put you in the</br>   system here.” I did, I gave him my birthday, everything that they needed.</br>   We went to a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> building. That's the building where they gave me the</br>   papers, my ID, which is a piece of paper with my name on it and information</br>   about me and then a picture of me. And they used that to give me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PERCENT">10%</span> off on</br>   buses, traveling, airplane tickets, anything. And from there we went to a</br>   different place—that's where you can call your family, whoever you need to</br>   send you money. That's where you can go ahead and trade your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> money</br>   to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> money.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: And that's what I did. I waited there for a little bit and they were</br>   like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Well I bought my ticket for my bus, I went with some people.</br>   And from there I bought my ticket and from buying my ticket I went to</br>   Monterey. From <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Monterey</span> I went to here, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>. From <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span> I</br>   went to [foreign language, location] that I had family in. So there—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: How did you do that? How did you travel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: How did I travel? Bus, all bus. It was long ride [Chuckle], a very</br>   long ride, it took like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">17 hours</span>. I was like &quot;Wow.&quot; I was super tired when</br>   I was looking for my grandparents. I saw my grandfather and I didn't know.</br>   I knew him, but I didn't recognize him. So, some people were helping—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Was that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time you net your grandfather?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">four</span>, so I don't remember him, I don't remember him</br>   at the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Had you ever seen him before, like over Skype?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Nope, maybe over video, but people look so different from video than</br>   from in person. So yeah, I didn't know how he looked like. So, I called my</br>   dad and I was like, &quot;Hey, how does your dad look like?&quot; [Chuckle]. And he</br>   was like, &quot;Well he's pretty short. He looks pretty white. He has green</br>   eyes.&quot; I'm like, &quot;Oh, he has green eyes. I didn't know this. I was looking</br>   for a Brown-eyed short person.&quot; And he was like, &quot;No, he has green eyes.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So finally, actually, my cousin found me, and he called</br>   me by my name. He had a deep, really deep voice—I got scared. I was like,</br>   &quot;Yeah, that's me.&quot; And he's like, &quot;Okay, well come with me. Your</br>   grandfather's over here.&quot; And I'm like, &quot;Okay. Well, they found me&quot;</br>   [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: So, I went to their house. They were asking me a few questions—my</br>   Spanish wasn't so well back then like it is now. And they said “Hi,” they</br>   introduced themselves. Of course, I knew off the bat it was my dad's</br>   family, him and his brother look so much alike. And I took a shower. It was</br>   very different because their home is a little bit more from when my dad was</br>   younger. They had the house since forever. They had a boiler in the back</br>   and stuff like that. It was very different customs here than over there.</br>   They had a washer, but it was very different. I was like a little bit in</br>   shock still where I was. I'm like &quot;Okay.&quot; At first they were strangers to</br>   me, so I was like &quot;Uh.”</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Whose house was it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: My grandparents. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Was this like a completely nice place?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah. It was very homey to put it in those words. Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Is that not something you had in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, or?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: I did. My parents, very neat home. But again, I felt an atmosphere</br>   in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> totally different from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. It's a little bit more eye-opening</br>   here than over there. Or I should say more alive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: More lively?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: More lively here than over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: [Laughs]. Is that because you can hear the music [crosstalk</br>   00:27:27]?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Laughs]. But in a good way.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: So, was that transition difficult after you kind of met with your</br>   grandparents?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: For me, surprisingly it wasn't that difficult. Adapting to a</br>   different environment was pretty easy for me. Since back in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> it was</br>   pretty difficult. For here, I just saw it as a new beginning, a new way for</br>   me to start build my life, be an adult. I'm adult, write my own story. And,</br>   for me, that was a little bit exciting. My parents are still a little bit</br>   sad that I'm not with them, but for me to open my wings, I see it that way.</br>   For me to start a new life, basically. And I did.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: A little bit of an opportunity for you, you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Aside from learning <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, what other things did you have to get</br>   used to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: A little bit of the customs, kind of like transportation—I was used</br>   to in-car transportation—through the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="FAC">Metro</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="PRODUCT">Combi</span> or microbus. So, it’s a</br>   little bit different. It's a lot better, but I do miss driving sometimes</br>   because I did drive a lot over there, but other times I'm just like &quot;I</br>   don't want to drive.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Were you able to get a job right after?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: Yes, I was quickly to get a job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: You said you wanted to go to school, you're still working on that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: [Affirmative noise]. Is there any way we can wrap this up because I</br>   have to get back to work? Sorry about that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: I guess, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">two</span> more important questions. In what ways do you think</br>   that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> shaped who you are now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>? I mean people in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, even in my parents, I see that they</br>   see <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> as very dangerous, very dark place to live. So they shaped me to</br>   believe into something that is not true. Completely not true. Actually the</br>   opposite. Coming to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> made me see that it was amazing to be here. It's</br>   actually a little bit more safer than over there. Over there, everywhere</br>   around the world, you get jumped, whatever. But over here, I mean I have</br>   been jumped before, but I still rather get jumped here than over there.</br>   It's a weird thing to say, but it's true because over there they won't</br>   think twice of killing you to say the least. I mean they bring guns to</br>   school. They're a little bit more violent in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> than here and they</br>   think here is violent. No, it's just we're more open showing you dead</br>   bodies on newspapers than I've noticed in over there. Over there, they were</br>   a little bit more like babying you and sugar coating it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Is there anything that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> can do better at helping</br>   you kind of return, reintegrate?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>: To return? Well for the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> they should not just put fake felonies on</br>   you for example. Because I know they just kind of put stuff together and</br>   they're like, &quot;Okay, here.&quot; But they can do a little bit more research on</br>   that and actually see what happened. If I got deported for that one reason,</br>   they could have just done a little bit more research instead of rushing</br>   through. That's what they can do better.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Sergio</span>: Okay. Thank you so much for your time <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Miguel</span>.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
