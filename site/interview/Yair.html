   dad, he was already there. He was already like a year over there, and then<br>
   he was talking to my mom saying that he wished for us to be over there with<br>
   him and my mom decided to just go over there. I didn't know anything. I<br>
   thought we were just going to a different house closer to here. I was like,<br>
   &quot;Okay. Well, yeah, we'll go to my dad,&quot; because I hadn't seen my dad for a<br>
   year, and I was really happy. I was really excited, you know, because I<br>
   hadn't seen my dad. I really missed him.<br>

I was like, &quot;Okay well.&quot;</br>   I thought it was really close, and all that. Then my mom was like ... We</br>   got to a place called ... Well, we stayed here from Mexico. That's called</br>   Reynosa. We went over there. We actually took a bus all the way over there,</br>   and it took us two or three days to get over there. Once we got there,</br>   there was this guy that was trying to ... Well, he said that he was going</br>   to cross us over the border by the river and stuff, and so we did, but the</br>   migration caught us. They took us to their ... How do you say it, their</br>   offices for migration?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Detention center?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. They were taking my mom's information, but didn't take ours</br>   because it was me and my sister. There was only three of us. Then after</br>   that, my mom called this guy, and he told her ... I think he told her that</br>   she was arrested or something, and we stayed there for five, six hours. My</br>   mom was really worried. She was worried about us because she didn't know</br>   what was going to happen to us and stuff. My mom was crying, and I was just</br>   sitting with her by her side.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then after that, this guy just came for us and took us to his house.</br>   We lived there for a month and waited for him-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You and your mom, or not with your mom?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: With my mom, yeah. Yeah, because I was not actually trying to let go</br>   of my mom cause I was with my mom all the time. I would just hold on to her</br>   hand, and my sister too. Then this guy told her, &quot;Well, you're going to</br>   stop by over my house. You can stay there,&quot; and this and that. This guy was</br>   the one that was going to cross us over, but I can't remember what was the</br>   issue though, but I think my dad had to send the money over to him again,</br>   but in the meanwhile, we were staying at his house for like a month.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: We didn't have nothing to eat. This guy really… he was not really</br>   polite to us and stuff most of the time, because we didn't have nothing to</br>   eat. My mom was just trying to see what work ... just to see if she could</br>   feed us, because she didn't have no money. My dad told her to send the</br>   location where we were at. I guess my dad was sending my mom money, so that</br>   way we can eat because this guy didn't give us nothing to eat or something,</br>   and my mom was getting really desperate. My mom was like, &quot;You know what?</br>   I'm just going to go back to the city, because this guy is not treating us</br>   right. He's not feeding us or anything like that, and the money that you're</br>   sending to him, I don't know what he's doing with it. He's not giving us</br>   nothing, and the kids needs clothes and stuff.&quot; That's when we decided to</br>   just come back. My mom was like, “No, I'm never going to try this again.</br>   I'm not going to risk my kids anymore,&quot; and this and that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My dad was like, &quot;No, this guy was really a bad dude.&quot; Then, I think,</br>   after like six months, seven months again, my dad kept insisting my mom to</br>   come over here, that he would get another person that could cross us over</br>   with no problems. It would be much safer. And then that’s when my mom</br>   thought about it and she was like,”Okay, well what's it going to be like</br>   this time?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: She’s like, &quot;Well, this time it's going to be you're going to cross</br>   over the kids over the border, but in the car. It's not going to be over</br>   the river or anything like that. It's in the car.&quot; Well, that's why my mom</br>   decided to say yes, because this is a better way to cross over. Then after</br>   that we got over to Reynosa again, and I think we did cross over the</br>   desert, yeah, the border. We were walking in the night, I remember. It was</br>   really dark. We couldn't see anything. We were just waiting for this guy to</br>   come over with a car to cross over.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: This guy crosses us over with fake papers of his kids. His kids were</br>   American citizens already, but he was pretending that ... Well, my mom was</br>   pretending to be his wife because we got stopped by the cops, I think, by</br>   the border. They were asking where were we going? He said ... I remember</br>   him saying that we were just coming to visit Mexico and stuff, and just</br>   crossed over. Actually, we were going to sleep in the back of the car, and</br>   that's how we crossed over.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My mom was really excited, and she was happy. Actually, she was</br>   crying and happy at the same time, because she was really worried. I didn't</br>   know what was going on, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot; I was too young to</br>   understand. I was like, &quot;Well, I got there.&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Yair: I got to my uncle's house. No, I'm sorry. We got to this guy's house</br>   in Texas. It was in Dallas, Texas. I can't remember what part exactly, but</br>   we stayed over his house for four, three days, and the guy was really nice.</br>   He actually had his family, his wife and kids. Most of the time ... I think</br>   my mom, I can remember my mom left with this guy to see something about the</br>   papers, or something like that, and she took one day. I didn't know</br>   anything, and then I was really worried. Then my sister and me stayed at</br>   this house with his wife and kids, but I didn't know anything about my mom.</br>   I just kept asking for the latest on my mom, like ”Hey, where's my mom?</br>   Where's my mom?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Well, she's doing something for the paperwork and stuff.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, paperwork?&quot; Then after that, we just left to Arkansas. We drove</br>   all the way to Arkansas, and that's where I have my ... Actually, my</br>   uncle's right now still. I got to one of my uncles' house, and we stayed.</br>   Well, he offered us rooms so that we could stay there, to live in,</br>   meanwhile, and my dad was working in another, I think, city. I can't</br>   remember the name of the city, though. He was working in work construction,</br>   on the roads. That's when we got, we went to visit him, and that's when we</br>   got to see him finally after like a year. That's when my dad came back to</br>   his brother's house, and he stayed there. They started working in the boat</br>   factory.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, my parents in Arkansas. Sorry, my dad knows how to weld boats</br>   and stuff. He's a welder, actually. My mom learned how to do it well, too.</br>   They were there working for almost nine years, because I was there nine</br>   years, living in Arkansas. I went to high school. I went to elementary,</br>   first grade, and high school, and I made a lot of friends. I did a lot of</br>   sports. I did basketball, football, baseball and track, running track.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, track.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I liked to do a lot of sports. I used to do that, and I always tried</br>   to keep good grades in my classes and all, for the main reason that the</br>   football coach was asking me, &quot;You have to get good grades and stuff.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; I really liked it over there. I really felt like, I</br>   don't know, it was my home, you know? I made a lot of friends. I didn't</br>   graduate because ... I was about to graduate there, but the reason we came</br>   back here was because my mom got sick. She has some problems about her ...</br>   how do you call it? She has some problems on her ... I forget how you call</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stomach?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No, from the woman's part. I can't remember. It's a woman's part</br>   inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uterus?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, the uterus. She got some problems there, and she was losing a</br>   lot of blood. I remember that she was going to the hospital a couple of</br>   times to get exams, to see what she had, what was wrong with her. They gave</br>   her a lot of excuses for her not to get surgery and stuff, and my mom got</br>   really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Firstly, my mom had an uncle that ... He's a doctor here in Mexico.</br>   He talked over a webcam with her, and he's like, &quot;No, you're really bad.</br>   You need to get surgery now. You're either going to stay there and die, or</br>   you're going to go and just come back here and get surgery, because you</br>   can't be like this no more. Within two or three days you're going to die.</br>   You can't be like this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: So my mom got scared, and we were really worried. We didn't know what</br>   to do now, because my dad was paying the bills for the exams, for the</br>   hospital. They were really expensive for him. They can't even afford to pay</br>   it. That's when my parents decided ... Well, my mom decided just to come</br>   back over here in the city, just to get surgery, and she did. After three</br>   or four months after she got surgery, she was okay, thank God.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then my dad, he said that he wanted to come back too, because my mom</br>   wanted to come back over there, but then she saw all her family after nine</br>   years and stuff. She said that she ... It was my decision if I wanted to</br>   stay. I was like, well, I did want to stay because I wanted to graduate</br>   from high school, but then she's like, &quot;No, I just want you guys to come</br>   back here.&quot; My dad took the decision to just come back over here. We drove</br>   all the way over here, and he took the car and trailer. We actually took</br>   all of our stuff from home for all the way over here. We took our kitchen,</br>   our living room.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Everything. We drove all the way over here. We didn't have no issue,</br>   no problem, thank God. That's how we got here. I really wanted to stay over</br>   there. I just wanted to come here just to visit, but I was already 18. I</br>   told my dad that I wanted to stay with my uncles, and he's like, &quot;No, you</br>   can't stay here with your uncles. What do you want to do?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Well, I'm just going to keep studying. I just want to stay here, you</br>   know?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But then I told my mom that, and she's like, &quot;No, don't stay. You can</br>   come back over here.&quot; She told me that crying, and I was like [inaudible</br>   00:13:00]. That's how she convinced me to come back. That's why I came</br>   back, and I'm living now here in Mexico City for nine years already since I</br>   came back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I came back here in 2010.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I'm 27.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I actually had to finish high school, well, my last high</br>   school, my last year of high school here because I didn't get to finish it</br>   over there. It was really hard for me, because I felt like at the beginning</br>   when I got over there in the United States, like I didn't know anything,</br>   nothing. I barely spoke Spanish. It was kind of hard for me to understand</br>   the math. All the subjects, the classes and stuff, it was really hard for</br>   me to understand. I cut my grades. Actually, my certificate grade was for</br>   7.9, which is really bad. It cost me a lot and all that. I barely made it.</br>   I barely graduated. Then after I graduated I started working, started</br>   finding jobs here, like call centers and stuff. Most of them, I have them,</br>   most of them are a lot of customer service now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But yeah, that's most of my experiences. My experience here in</br>   Mexico, it's a big change because it's a city. There's a lot of danger. Not</br>   a lot of danger, but it depends on what area you live in because not all</br>   areas are bad, and some areas are really calm and nice. But if you live ...</br>   What do they say? In the hood or stuff, there's a lot of crime and a lot of</br>   people that sells drugs, and a lot of killing also. But most of the time I</br>   don't deal with those type of people. I try to stay away from them. I have</br>   friends that are like that, but I don't want to be in that situation. I</br>   don't want to be engaged with them, to hang out with them, because even</br>   though ... If I hang out with them or stuff, I know maybe someday I'll be</br>   in trouble or something. I don't know.</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But right now I have a daughter. She's four years old. I used to be</br>   married. I got separated a year and five months already, and I see her on</br>   the weekends. No, most of the time I see her, but I used to see her every</br>   day. Now with the schedule from work that I have, it doesn't really work</br>   for me that much. I'm trying to find something else, for a better schedule,</br>   then to spend the time with her because I really like to spend time with my</br>   daughter, to just drive and go places. Last week I took her over here,</br>   actually, so she can know the Monumento de la Revolución. I took her over</br>   here. She really liked it, and I'm planning to take her to more places,</br>   really cool places.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But yeah, that's the story of my life. If I had a chance to go back</br>   in the United States, I would. I never had any papers or any ID or anything</br>   like that, and I actually, I made up my own card, so I worked over there</br>   too by cleaning yards. I actually worked for a little while in the boat</br>   factory with my parents. I used to get paid, I think, $450 a week. That's</br>   how I started saving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's not bad.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, it was not bad. I was like, wow, that's a lot of money. I love</br>   that. Then I started saving for me to buy a car, or I did buy my first car.</br>   I actually had two cars over there, and I sold them. I sold them when I</br>   came back over here to Mexico City. I went to a school that's called UM.</br>   That's a pay school, where you have to pay to study. I used all my money of</br>   my car to study over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To get your degree?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your high school degree?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, just to get it. Then after that I had no car, and I started</br>   working again. I made another ... Well, I saved up for another car. Right</br>   now I have a motorcycle, but I have to watch out in the streets because</br>   right here, they really drive really crazy. They don't have no limit. They</br>   don't have no rules. We do have rules, but a lot of people don't respect</br>   it. You have to drive really careful and stuff. What else?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Let me ask you a couple things about the US. You got there when you</br>   were nine, 10?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, nine.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You started school. It must have been hard, because you didn't know</br>   any English.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I didn't know any English. I tried to spoke most of the time in</br>   Spanish, but a lot of the kids, they didn't understand me. I didn't either,</br>   so I can't remember what they were telling me at the beginning. I started-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to get adjusted [inaudible 00:18:06]?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It took me, I don't know, five, six months, because I kept asking my</br>   mom, &quot;When are we coming back home? When are we coming back home?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: She's like, &quot;No, we're going to stay here. This is your home now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I'm like, &quot;What? What do you mean?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I remember that I started crying because I missed my family, my</br>   cousins and my friends at school. I just wanted to go back, and then I</br>   started getting used to it, once you're in school. School was really a big</br>   difference, because here, the school here in Mexico, they don't have that,</br>   what do you call it? They have the education, but not as much as over</br>   there. Over there it was way easier to do it. You could wear your own</br>   clothes. Here, you have to wear a uniform to go to school. I think that I</br>   hated it all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: The teachers were really disciplined, and they really cared about</br>   you, about your grades and stuff. I actually had a lot of teachers that</br>   were teaching me English, teaching me how to read, speak well, pronouncing</br>   words. Yeah, they helped me a lot. I had a lot of teachers helping me, and</br>   I really learned a lot from them, words, how to speak, or how to pronounce</br>   words and stuff. I'm actually trying to ... I was teaching them also</br>   Spanish, because they wanted to learn Spanish. I was like, &quot;Yeah, I can</br>   teach you.”</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;How do you say this in Spanish?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, you say this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; It was kind of a thing for me to teach them, and them to</br>   teach me too, so it was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You made a lot of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I did make a lot of friends, because actually when I was in</br>   football, because when I got into football, I really like… I was a</br>   linebacker.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Tough.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yea actually, I actually miss football. Every time I see football</br>   games and stuff, I remember there the training, the training in the</br>   mornings, the summer training stuff. I miss everything. After I got into</br>   football, I made a lot of friends. Most of the time when I was free after</br>   school I spent my time with them playing basketball, always doing</br>   something, because over there in Arkansas, in Clinton, Arkansas, there's</br>   not much to do. It's a really small town.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. No, there were not gangs. It’s not that, uh, don’t take it</br>   personal or anything. There was a lot of Americans there. There was not as</br>   much African Americans, Mexican people. There was not much. It was just a</br>   couple of us, like four or five Mexicans there, and the rest are American</br>   people. But no, there were not any gangs. It was really nice. There was a</br>   lot of country music and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Country music?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, like rodeos and things like that. I really liked most of the</br>   time going to the rodeos, and seeing people ride the bulls and the horses</br>   and stuff. It was really nice. But there was not any gangs. I used to go to</br>   the city in Little Rock, which is the city in Arkansas. I used to go there</br>   just to go clubbing, parties and stuff, but I never wanted to be part of</br>   the gang. I did have some friends that offered me to be part of the gang,</br>   and sell weed and stuff. I was like, &quot;No, I'm not going to do this, man.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;No.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: They were like, &quot;Come on.&quot; They were trying to convince me. They did</br>   try to give me a gun also.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;No, I don't need this in my life right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;You need it for you to be part of this business.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;No. I don't want to be part of this business. I'm illegal here. I</br>   don't have no documents and stuff. I want to keep studying. I want to do</br>   something with my life, and I don't want to ruin it for a drug. I don't</br>   need the money. If I need the money, I'll work, I'll do something, but not</br>   this way, though.&quot; Yeah, there was not any gangs. It was really calm over</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams when you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were you dreaming to do?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My dream was to be a producer, music producer, because I really liked</br>   music. I remember that I spoke with my music teacher. She gave me this disc</br>   that has a lot of things that you can do, for you to do instrumentals and</br>   stuff. I did it. I didn't know anything, but I think I'm good at it, making</br>   instrumentals for music. I really liked that, and I wanted to study that or</br>   to become one of the producers and stuff, because I like music. The other</br>   of my dreams was for me to have a house, my own car, and also get married</br>   and have a family. That was most of my dreams. Yeah, that's about it, I</br>   think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Did you apply for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. No, I never did. Actually, once I heard from that I was already</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah. You came back when?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: In 2010.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, 2010. Yeah. Yeah it's too ...</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. Actually when I was still over there, I heard about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was starting.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It was barely starting, and I told my dad about it. He was like, &quot;No,</br>   they're not going to give, they’re not going to do nothing,&quot; or, &quot;You're</br>   not going to get nothing done.&quot; I was planning to do it, to apply for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If you could stay.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, if I could stay, but my dad didn't care that much. He just had</br>   plans to come back over here. I wanted to do it because I heard that if you</br>   were studying, or if you never had been reported or anything like that, you</br>   would get the chance to stay over there, and get the paper or something. I</br>   wanted to do it, but I never took that chance for me to search, or to see</br>   where I could sign up for that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then when we were already over here, me and my family and my sister,</br>   we heard that, on the news actually, we heard that Obama gave a lot of</br>   opportunity to allow immigrant people to study over here, or to study in</br>   the US, to have papers and stuff. I was like, &quot;Man.&quot; I told my dad, &quot;See,</br>   Dad? I told you to stay over there, man.&quot; I mean, I really liked it over</br>   there. I got used to it, and I just wanted to live over there. I wanted to</br>   come over here but just to visit my family, and come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But after a year I came back from over there, and I started living</br>   here. I had plans to go back, to go back over there. I was trying to get my</br>   passport and the visa, but I never got the chance to get the visa because I</br>   heard a lot of rumors saying that people that are trying to get visas from</br>   here, from Mexico, most of the time they reject them and not give them to</br>   them, so I was like, I don't want to waste my money, because the visa here</br>   costs 4,000, almost 5,000 to get the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Pesos?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, man, that's a lot of money.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: What if they don't give it to me, and I'm going to spend out that</br>   amount? That's why I didn't decide to get the visa. I already had my</br>   passport set up for me to go and get the visa, but they told me that rumor.</br>   Then I was like, &quot;Man, I'm not going to get it,&quot; so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were back in the States, you said you had two cars. Did you</br>   have a license?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. I didn't have anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were careful?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I was really careful. I actually followed the rules. I actually</br>   got the guide from, what's it called it, the transit guide? I can't</br>   remember.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Department of Motor Vehicles? Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I had the guide. I studied them, I read over the rules.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, motor vehicles. Yeah, yeah, so you knew what to do?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I knew what to do, and I was really careful about everything,</br>   about speed. I watched the speed limit. I always respected. All the time</br>   that I drove over there I never got stopped by a cop or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That’s good.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I was really, really careful because I was like, man, what if I</br>   get stopped or pulled over, if I get a ticket? Maybe I'll pay the ticket,</br>   but you never know what type of police cop you'll get. I did have a lot of</br>   racist people from over there, but I didn't really pay attention to them.</br>   Most of the time I did got in a fight with them, and after that they didn't</br>   bother me no more. I know what people are good to you, and what, some</br>   people that are not good to you. I never took it really personal, but there</br>   was actually one. There was this actually one time that ... I think I was</br>   nine? No, 12, 11 years old. I was on the bus. The bus takes you home. There</br>   was this one big kid, I remember. He was making fun of, and making jokes</br>   about, African people. He was bothering this guy, and I got mad. I stood</br>   up, and I was like, &quot;What have you got to say?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: He's like, &quot;What are you going to do? You're not going to do nothing.</br>   You're Mexican. You beat on yourself like that?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;Man, you think you are tough because you're tall or</br>   whatever? What gives you the right to judge the people? Nobody's judging</br>   you, so you had better leave him alone.&quot; That's why I got in a fight with</br>   him. I didn't know how to do it. He was really tall. He was this tall to</br>   me, and I don't know how I did it, but I took some punches and I won the</br>   fight, basically.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: After a day people were telling me, &quot;Oh, dude, you beat him up,&quot; and</br>   this and that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;Well, yeah, but he was bothering this guy.&quot; I'm the type</br>   of person that I don't like seeing people bothering other people when they</br>   think they're all that. I don't know. I just don't like that attitude, when</br>   people have that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. What do you miss most from the US, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: A lot of things. I miss the places, or the lifestyle over there. The</br>   lifestyle is really different. It's really calm. You can do anything. You</br>   can do anything, but not everything here, the rules, the security. Here in</br>   Mexico there's a lot of traffic of drugs, car dealers and stuff. You can't</br>   be really safe sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: What I miss over there also is just most of the time the lifestyle,</br>   because I lived over there in a small country, a small town, and I could do</br>   anything. I could go fishing, I could go to a lake, play basketball, really</br>   anything, like going to the woods. I miss all that. Basically you can find</br>   the same thing here in Mexico, but it's not the same as over there.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Also, the economy, obviously, the work. I remember that every time we</br>   go out shopping to Walmart, my parents spent $150 or $200, and we bought a</br>   lot of food. It lasted for us for almost two weeks. Here in Mexico, with</br>   2,000 pesos you can buy a lot of food, but it's too expensive. Also, is it</br>   closed?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I mean, what I also miss from over there, everything from over there,</br>   the clothes, the shoes, the cars. I actually liked the motorcycles and</br>   everything. They have good quality, you know? Here in Mexico you can find</br>   anything. You can find the same thing, but not as much good quality, or you</br>   can, but it's really expensive. For example, for shoes, some Nike shoes, I</br>   really like some Nike shoes. Nike shoes are like here they're 3,000 or</br>   4,000 or 5,000 pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Over there in the United States, I remember I bought my shoes for</br>   $90, $60.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It was cheaper. The dollar over here is big money, but over there,</br>   I've seen everything is cheaper over there. You can get more stuff, or you</br>   can do more of your own things than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. That's a lot of money.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Actually, I miss also the people. There's a lot of really nice people</br>   that I met over there. Most of them I really lost touch with them, but I</br>   can't remember why. We're just talking sometimes, but not most of the time</br>   I talk to them. Yeah, that's what I miss.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think going to the United States and living there for ... You</br>   were there for nine years, right?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that made you a different person than you would have</br>   been if you had you never gone?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I do.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did it make you different? What changed you? How are you</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I think the education over there in high school ... Well, in school,</br>   because over there the teachers always used to tell us that we have to be</br>   good. We have to tell the truth, we have to be respectful. We have to be</br>   responsible. And I think I got a lot of helpful [inaudible 00:33:19] over</br>   there from people. They were really nice to me, and they changed my ways,</br>   because I always asked myself that question too. What would have been of me</br>   if I would have never be over there? What would I be, like, what type of</br>   person would I be right now?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It did change me a lot, I think, because coming back over here was</br>   way too different. I'm actually one of those persons that if you tell me</br>   something, I'll believe it. But then after living here, having a lot of</br>   experience with people that have bad influence, you start getting to know</br>   that there's not always a lot of good people. Yeah, I think that really</br>   changed me, or helped me a lot, living over there.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I can't really remember myself being as a kid. I can't remember how I</br>   was, but growing up over there, knowing the things, the places and people</br>   that you know, the education from school that you got, I think it's a lot</br>   different than over here. Here in Mexico here it is nice too, but they</br>   don't have really the same education that's over there. Here, people from</br>   Mexico, they do whatever they want. They don't follow the rules, or I don't</br>   know, I just think it's about the education difference. Yeah, I think, I</br>   don’t know. Yeah. I think I'm a honest people, person, I mean. I don't like</br>   to really lie and stuff, or make up things. I just tell what I feel, what</br>   I've been through.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It must have been helpful to have your family here when you came</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: …your mom and dad, and sister and all. Are you living with them now,</br>   or no?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. Right now I'm living with my parents because ... I used to not</br>   live with them when I was married. I was living on my own. Now that I got</br>   separated, I'm living with them again. I'm planning to be on my own again</br>   for myself, because my sister's there too with her husband and kid. We're</br>   really crowded in there, so it's a lot of issues and problems with them. I</br>   just want to move by my own some day. That's what I'm planning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are your dreams now that you're back? Have they changed? Are</br>   they similar?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Now that I’m here? No, they haven't changed, because I actually want</br>   to keep doing the same thing. Right now I'm still trying to do</br>   instrumentals for music and stuff, like rap, hip hop or anything. I just</br>   want to keep doing that. My dream also here is just to get my house, my own</br>   house, my own car too, just have a family, maybe also buy houses or</br>   apartments and rent them and stuff. That's what my plan is to be, what to</br>   do here. But also I've been thinking about going over there to the United</br>   States, but I don't know how, and I don't know who or where. There's a lot</br>   of people that tell me I can get the visa and stuff. I would do it, but I</br>   mean I think that well… They are giving chances to go there to visit only</br>   for six, seven months, or to work there for a year. I would go back just to</br>   work and make some money, and come back over here and put a business or</br>   something, I don't know. I don't know how things are over there now. It's</br>   been a long time. That's my plan, is to be here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we're going to end in a minute, but is there anything that you'd</br>   like to share with the people who listen to this recording of your story?</br>   Anything more that you haven't said about your experiences, or experiences</br>   of other returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Well, I think that my experience here, to be coming back over here is</br>   not as big deal. It was really a different way for me to come over here,</br>   because a lot of people that I know from over there ... Well, that I know</br>   here, that they come from over there too. They say that they had to go</br>   through a lot of things. They've been locked up, or they've been reported</br>   for motoring, or selling drugs, or being in a gang, or stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="dba5326d-6a80-4bef-889b-9fbef675527a" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico">Yair: But my experience, to come back over here to Mexico is ... I don't<br>
   know. I always see it as a sign of God, or I don't know. It changed my life<br>
   really, really, completely. The way of seeing things too, here from over<br>
   there. I don't really have that ... I can't really explain what I mean, to<br>
   tell you the experience. I don't know. The experience will be, just for me,<br>
   living in another country and switching back in place, and that's it. It's<br>
   not that much, because most of the time that I was over there in the United<br>
   States, I was referred to as a kid. I don't really remember everything, but<br>
   being here, I just had to deal with it and just stay, see what comes up,<br>

 <br>
   Yair: Yeah, it was not bad. I was like, wow, that's a lot of money. I love<br>
   that. Then I started saving for me to buy a car, or I did buy my first car.<br>
   I actually had two cars over there, and I sold them. I sold them when I<br>
   came back over here to Mexico City. I went to a school that's called UM.<br>
   That's a pay school, where you have to pay to study. I used all my money of<br>
   my car to study over there.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: To get your degree?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yair: Yeah.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anne: Your high school degree?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Yair: Yeah, just to get it. Then after that I had no car, and I started<br>
   working again. I made another ...

If I had a chance to go back<br>
   in the United States, I would. I never had any papers or any ID or anything<br>
   like that, and I actually, I made up my own card, so I worked over there<br>
   too by cleaning yards. I actually worked for a little while in the boat<br>
   factory with my parents. I used to get paid, I think, $450 a week. That's<br>
   how I started saving.<br>

   Mexico, it's a big change because it's a city. There's a lot of danger. Not<br>
   a lot of danger, but it depends on what area you live in because not all<br>
   areas are bad, and some areas are really calm and nice. But if you live ...<br>
   What do they say? In the hood or stuff, there's a lot of crime and a lot of<br>
   people that sells drugs, and a lot of killing also. But most of the time I<br>
   don't deal with those type of people. I try to stay away from them. I have<br>
   friends that are like that, but I don't want to be in that situation. I<br>
   don't want to be engaged with them, to hang out with them, because even<br>
   though ... If I hang out with them or stuff, I know maybe someday I'll be<br>
   in trouble or something. I don't know.<br>

   school, my last year of high school here because I didn't get to finish it<br>
   over there. It was really hard for me, because I felt like at the beginning<br>
   when I got over there in the United States, like I didn't know anything,<br>
   nothing. I barely spoke Spanish. It was kind of hard for me to understand<br>
   the math. All the subjects, the classes and stuff, it was really hard for<br>
   me to understand. I cut my grades. Actually, my certificate grade was for<br>
   7.9, which is really bad. It cost me a lot and all that. I barely made it.<br>
   I barely graduated. Then after I graduated I started working, started<br>
   finding jobs here, like call centers and stuff. Most of them, I have them,<br>
   most of them are a lot of customer service now.<br>

   all the way to Arkansas, and that's where I have my ... Actually, my<br>
   uncle's right now still. I got to one of my uncles' house, and we stayed.<br>
   Well, he offered us rooms so that we could stay there, to live in,<br>
   meanwhile, and my dad was working in another, I think, city. I can't<br>
   remember the name of the city, though. He was working in work construction,<br>
   on the roads. That's when we got, we went to visit him, and that's when we<br>
   got to see him finally after like a year. That's when my dad came back to<br>
   his brother's house, and he stayed there. They started working in the boat<br>

 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, my parents in Arkansas. Sorry, my dad knows how to weld boats</br>   and stuff. He's a welder, actually. My mom learned how to do it well, too.</br>   They were there working for almost nine years, because I was there nine</br>   years, living in Arkansas. I went to high school. I went to elementary,</br>   first grade, and high school, and I made a lot of friends. I did a lot of</br>   sports. I did basketball, football, baseball and track, running track.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, track.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I liked to do a lot of sports. I used to do that, and I always tried</br>   to keep good grades in my classes and all, for the main reason that the</br>   football coach was asking me, &quot;You have to get good grades and stuff.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; I really liked it over there. I really felt like, I</br>   don't know, it was my home, you know? I made a lot of friends. I didn't</br>   graduate because ... I was about to graduate there, but the reason we came</br>   back here was because my mom got sick. She has some problems about her ...</br>   how do you call it? She has some problems on her ... I forget how you call</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stomach?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No, from the woman's part. I can't remember. It's a woman's part</br>   inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uterus?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, the uterus. She got some problems there, and she was losing a</br>   lot of blood. I remember that she was going to the hospital a couple of</br>   times to get exams, to see what she had, what was wrong with her. They gave</br>   her a lot of excuses for her not to get surgery and stuff, and my mom got</br>   really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Firstly, my mom had an uncle that ... He's a doctor here in Mexico.</br>   He talked over a webcam with her, and he's like, &quot;No, you're really bad.</br>   You need to get surgery now. You're either going to stay there and die, or</br>   you're going to go and just come back here and get surgery, because you</br>   can't be like this no more. Within two or three days you're going to die.</br>   You can't be like this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: So my mom got scared, and we were really worried. We didn't know what</br>   to do now, because my dad was paying the bills for the exams, for the</br>   hospital. They were really expensive for him. They can't even afford to pay</br>   it. That's when my parents decided ... Well, my mom decided just to come</br>   back over here in the city, just to get surgery, and she did. After three</br>   or four months after she got surgery, she was okay, thank God.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then my dad, he said that he wanted to come back too, because my mom</br>   wanted to come back over there, but then she saw all her family after nine</br>   years and stuff. She said that she ... It was my decision if I wanted to</br>   stay. I was like, well, I did want to stay because I wanted to graduate</br>   from high school, but then she's like, &quot;No, I just want you guys to come</br>   back here.&quot; My dad took the decision to just come back over here. We drove</br>   all the way over here, and he took the car and trailer. We actually took</br>   all of our stuff from home for all the way over here. We took our kitchen,</br>   our living room.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Everything. We drove all the way over here. We didn't have no issue,</br>   no problem, thank God. That's how we got here. I really wanted to stay over</br>   there. I just wanted to come here just to visit, but I was already 18. I</br>   told my dad that I wanted to stay with my uncles, and he's like, &quot;No, you</br>   can't stay here with your uncles.

It's not going to be over</br>   the river or anything like that. It's in the car.&quot; Well, that's why my mom</br>   decided to say yes, because this is a better way to cross over. Then after</br>   that we got over to Reynosa again, and I think we did cross over the</br>   desert, yeah, the border. We were walking in the night, I remember. It was</br>   really dark. We couldn't see anything. We were just waiting for this guy to</br>   come over with a car to cross over.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: This guy crosses us over with fake papers of his kids. His kids were</br>   American citizens already, but he was pretending that ... Well, my mom was</br>   pretending to be his wife because we got stopped by the cops, I think, by</br>   the border. They were asking where were we going? He said ... I remember</br>   him saying that we were just coming to visit Mexico and stuff, and just</br>   crossed over. Actually, we were going to sleep in the back of the car, and</br>   that's how we crossed over.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My mom was really excited, and she was happy. Actually, she was</br>   crying and happy at the same time, because she was really worried. I didn't</br>   know what was going on, and I was like, &quot;What?&quot; I was too young to</br>   understand. I was like, &quot;Well, I got there.&quot;</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Yair: I got to my uncle's house. No, I'm sorry. We got to this guy's house</br>   in Texas. It was in Dallas, Texas. I can't remember what part exactly, but</br>   we stayed over his house for four, three days, and the guy was really nice.</br>   He actually had his family, his wife and kids. Most of the time ... I think</br>   my mom, I can remember my mom left with this guy to see something about the</br>   papers, or something like that, and she took one day. I didn't know</br>   anything, and then I was really worried. Then my sister and me stayed at</br>   this house with his wife and kids, but I didn't know anything about my mom.</br>   I just kept asking for the latest on my mom, like ”Hey, where's my mom?</br>   Where's my mom?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Well, she's doing something for the paperwork and stuff.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, paperwork?&quot; Then after that, we just left to Arkansas. We drove</br>   all the way to Arkansas, and that's where I have my ... Actually, my</br>   uncle's right now still. I got to one of my uncles' house, and we stayed.</br>   Well, he offered us rooms so that we could stay there, to live in,</br>   meanwhile, and my dad was working in another, I think, city. I can't</br>   remember the name of the city, though. He was working in work construction,</br>   on the roads. That's when we got, we went to visit him, and that's when we</br>   got to see him finally after like a year. That's when my dad came back to</br>   his brother's house, and he stayed there. They started working in the boat</br>   factory.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Okay.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, my parents in Arkansas. Sorry, my dad knows how to weld boats</br>   and stuff. He's a welder, actually. My mom learned how to do it well, too.</br>   They were there working for almost nine years, because I was there nine</br>   years, living in Arkansas. I went to high school. I went to elementary,</br>   first grade, and high school, and I made a lot of friends. I did a lot of</br>   sports. I did basketball, football, baseball and track, running track.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, track.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I liked to do a lot of sports. I used to do that, and I always tried</br>   to keep good grades in my classes and all, for the main reason that the</br>   football coach was asking me, &quot;You have to get good grades and stuff.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Okay, okay.&quot; I really liked it over there. I really felt like, I</br>   don't know, it was my home, you know? I made a lot of friends. I didn't</br>   graduate because ... I was about to graduate there, but the reason we came</br>   back here was because my mom got sick. She has some problems about her ...</br>   how do you call it? She has some problems on her ... I forget how you call</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Stomach?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No, from the woman's part. I can't remember. It's a woman's part</br>   inside.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Uterus?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, the uterus. She got some problems there, and she was losing a</br>   lot of blood. I remember that she was going to the hospital a couple of</br>   times to get exams, to see what she had, what was wrong with her. They gave</br>   her a lot of excuses for her not to get surgery and stuff, and my mom got</br>   really sick.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Firstly, my mom had an uncle that ... He's a doctor here in Mexico.</br>   He talked over a webcam with her, and he's like, &quot;No, you're really bad.</br>   You need to get surgery now. You're either going to stay there and die, or</br>   you're going to go and just come back here and get surgery, because you</br>   can't be like this no more. Within two or three days you're going to die.</br>   You can't be like this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: So my mom got scared, and we were really worried. We didn't know what</br>   to do now, because my dad was paying the bills for the exams, for the</br>   hospital. They were really expensive for him. They can't even afford to pay</br>   it. That's when my parents decided ... Well, my mom decided just to come</br>   back over here in the city, just to get surgery, and she did. After three</br>   or four months after she got surgery, she was okay, thank God.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then my dad, he said that he wanted to come back too, because my mom</br>   wanted to come back over there, but then she saw all her family after nine</br>   years and stuff. She said that she ... It was my decision if I wanted to</br>   stay. I was like, well, I did want to stay because I wanted to graduate</br>   from high school, but then she's like, &quot;No, I just want you guys to come</br>   back here.&quot; My dad took the decision to just come back over here. We drove</br>   all the way over here, and he took the car and trailer. We actually took</br>   all of our stuff from home for all the way over here. We took our kitchen,</br>   our living room.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Everything. We drove all the way over here. We didn't have no issue,</br>   no problem, thank God. That's how we got here. I really wanted to stay over</br>   there. I just wanted to come here just to visit, but I was already 18. I</br>   told my dad that I wanted to stay with my uncles, and he's like, &quot;No, you</br>   can't stay here with your uncles. What do you want to do?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Well, I'm just going to keep studying. I just want to stay here, you</br>   know?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But then I told my mom that, and she's like, &quot;No, don't stay. You can</br>   come back over here.&quot; She told me that crying, and I was like [inaudible</br>   00:13:00]. That's how she convinced me to come back. That's why I came</br>   back, and I'm living now here in Mexico City for nine years already since I</br>   came back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I came back here in 2010.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So how old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I'm 27.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I actually had to finish high school, well, my last high</br>   school, my last year of high school here because I didn't get to finish it</br>   over there. It was really hard for me, because I felt like at the beginning</br>   when I got over there in the United States, like I didn't know anything,</br>   nothing. I barely spoke Spanish. It was kind of hard for me to understand</br>   the math. All the subjects, the classes and stuff, it was really hard for</br>   me to understand. I cut my grades. Actually, my certificate grade was for</br>   7.9, which is really bad. It cost me a lot and all that. I barely made it.</br>   I barely graduated. Then after I graduated I started working, started</br>   finding jobs here, like call centers and stuff. Most of them, I have them,</br>   most of them are a lot of customer service now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Right.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But yeah, that's most of my experiences. My experience here in</br>   Mexico, it's a big change because it's a city. There's a lot of danger. Not</br>   a lot of danger, but it depends on what area you live in because not all</br>   areas are bad, and some areas are really calm and nice. But if you live ...</br>   What do they say? In the hood or stuff, there's a lot of crime and a lot of</br>   people that sells drugs, and a lot of killing also. But most of the time I</br>   don't deal with those type of people. I try to stay away from them. I have</br>   friends that are like that, but I don't want to be in that situation. I</br>   don't want to be engaged with them, to hang out with them, because even</br>   though ... If I hang out with them or stuff, I know maybe someday I'll be</br>   in trouble or something. I don't know.</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br>   &lt;br/&gt;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But right now I have a daughter. She's four years old. I used to be</br>   married. I got separated a year and five months already, and I see her on</br>   the weekends. No, most of the time I see her, but I used to see her every</br>   day. Now with the schedule from work that I have, it doesn't really work</br>   for me that much. I'm trying to find something else, for a better schedule,</br>   then to spend the time with her because I really like to spend time with my</br>   daughter, to just drive and go places. Last week I took her over here,</br>   actually, so she can know the Monumento de la Revolución. I took her over</br>   here. She really liked it, and I'm planning to take her to more places,</br>   really cool places.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But yeah, that's the story of my life. If I had a chance to go back</br>   in the United States, I would. I never had any papers or any ID or anything</br>   like that, and I actually, I made up my own card, so I worked over there</br>   too by cleaning yards. I actually worked for a little while in the boat</br>   factory with my parents. I used to get paid, I think, $450 a week. That's</br>   how I started saving.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's not bad.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, it was not bad. I was like, wow, that's a lot of money. I love</br>   that. Then I started saving for me to buy a car, or I did buy my first car.</br>   I actually had two cars over there, and I sold them. I sold them when I</br>   came back over here to Mexico City. I went to a school that's called UM.</br>   That's a pay school, where you have to pay to study. I used all my money of</br>   my car to study over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: To get your degree?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Your high school degree?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, just to get it. Then after that I had no car, and I started</br>   working again. I made another ... Well, I saved up for another car. Right</br>   now I have a motorcycle, but I have to watch out in the streets because</br>   right here, they really drive really crazy. They don't have no limit. They</br>   don't have no rules. We do have rules, but a lot of people don't respect</br>   it. You have to drive really careful and stuff. What else?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Let me ask you a couple things about the US. You got there when you</br>   were nine, 10?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, nine.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You started school. It must have been hard, because you didn't know</br>   any English.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I didn't know any English. I tried to spoke most of the time in</br>   Spanish, but a lot of the kids, they didn't understand me. I didn't either,</br>   so I can't remember what they were telling me at the beginning. I started-</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to get adjusted [inaudible 00:18:06]?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It took me, I don't know, five, six months, because I kept asking my</br>   mom, &quot;When are we coming back home? When are we coming back home?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: She's like, &quot;No, we're going to stay here. This is your home now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I'm like, &quot;What? What do you mean?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I remember that I started crying because I missed my family, my</br>   cousins and my friends at school. I just wanted to go back, and then I</br>   started getting used to it, once you're in school. School was really a big</br>   difference, because here, the school here in Mexico, they don't have that,</br>   what do you call it? They have the education, but not as much as over</br>   there. Over there it was way easier to do it. You could wear your own</br>   clothes. Here, you have to wear a uniform to go to school. I think that I</br>   hated it all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: The teachers were really disciplined, and they really cared about</br>   you, about your grades and stuff. I actually had a lot of teachers that</br>   were teaching me English, teaching me how to read, speak well, pronouncing</br>   words. Yeah, they helped me a lot. I had a lot of teachers helping me, and</br>   I really learned a lot from them, words, how to speak, or how to pronounce</br>   words and stuff. I'm actually trying to ... I was teaching them also</br>   Spanish, because they wanted to learn Spanish. I was like, &quot;Yeah, I can</br>   teach you.”</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;How do you say this in Spanish?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, you say this.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; It was kind of a thing for me to teach them, and them to</br>   teach me too, so it was nice.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You made a lot of friends?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I did make a lot of friends, because actually when I was in</br>   football, because when I got into football, I really like… I was a</br>   linebacker.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Tough.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yea actually, I actually miss football. Every time I see football</br>   games and stuff, I remember there the training, the training in the</br>   mornings, the summer training stuff. I miss everything. After I got into</br>   football, I made a lot of friends. Most of the time when I was free after</br>   school I spent my time with them playing basketball, always doing</br>   something, because over there in Arkansas, in Clinton, Arkansas, there's</br>   not much to do. It's a really small town.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were there gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. No, there were not gangs. It’s not that, uh, don’t take it</br>   personal or anything. There was a lot of Americans there. There was not as</br>   much African Americans, Mexican people. There was not much. It was just a</br>   couple of us, like four or five Mexicans there, and the rest are American</br>   people. But no, there were not any gangs. It was really nice. There was a</br>   lot of country music and stuff.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Country music?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, like rodeos and things like that. I really liked most of the</br>   time going to the rodeos, and seeing people ride the bulls and the horses</br>   and stuff. It was really nice. But there was not any gangs. I used to go to</br>   the city in Little Rock, which is the city in Arkansas. I used to go there</br>   just to go clubbing, parties and stuff, but I never wanted to be part of</br>   the gang. I did have some friends that offered me to be part of the gang,</br>   and sell weed and stuff. I was like, &quot;No, I'm not going to do this, man.&quot;</br>   I'm like, &quot;No.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: They were like, &quot;Come on.&quot; They were trying to convince me. They did</br>   try to give me a gun also.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;No, I don't need this in my life right now.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;You need it for you to be part of this business.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: &quot;No. I don't want to be part of this business. I'm illegal here. I</br>   don't have no documents and stuff. I want to keep studying. I want to do</br>   something with my life, and I don't want to ruin it for a drug. I don't</br>   need the money. If I need the money, I'll work, I'll do something, but not</br>   this way, though.&quot; Yeah, there was not any gangs. It was really calm over</br>   there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were your dreams when you were there?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My dreams?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What were you dreaming to do?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: My dream was to be a producer, music producer, because I really liked</br>   music. I remember that I spoke with my music teacher. She gave me this disc</br>   that has a lot of things that you can do, for you to do instrumentals and</br>   stuff. I did it. I didn't know anything, but I think I'm good at it, making</br>   instrumentals for music. I really liked that, and I wanted to study that or</br>   to become one of the producers and stuff, because I like music. The other</br>   of my dreams was for me to have a house, my own car, and also get married</br>   and have a family. That was most of my dreams. Yeah, that's about it, I</br>   think.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. Did you apply for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. No, I never did. Actually, once I heard from that I was already</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, yeah. You came back when?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: In 2010.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, 2010. Yeah. Yeah it's too ...</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. Actually when I was still over there, I heard about it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It was starting.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It was barely starting, and I told my dad about it. He was like, &quot;No,</br>   they're not going to give, they’re not going to do nothing,&quot; or, &quot;You're</br>   not going to get nothing done.&quot; I was planning to do it, to apply for it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: If you could stay.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, if I could stay, but my dad didn't care that much. He just had</br>   plans to come back over here. I wanted to do it because I heard that if you</br>   were studying, or if you never had been reported or anything like that, you</br>   would get the chance to stay over there, and get the paper or something. I</br>   wanted to do it, but I never took that chance for me to search, or to see</br>   where I could sign up for that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Then when we were already over here, me and my family and my sister,</br>   we heard that, on the news actually, we heard that Obama gave a lot of</br>   opportunity to allow immigrant people to study over here, or to study in</br>   the US, to have papers and stuff. I was like, &quot;Man.&quot; I told my dad, &quot;See,</br>   Dad? I told you to stay over there, man.&quot; I mean, I really liked it over</br>   there. I got used to it, and I just wanted to live over there. I wanted to</br>   come over here but just to visit my family, and come back.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But after a year I came back from over there, and I started living</br>   here. I had plans to go back, to go back over there. I was trying to get my</br>   passport and the visa, but I never got the chance to get the visa because I</br>   heard a lot of rumors saying that people that are trying to get visas from</br>   here, from Mexico, most of the time they reject them and not give them to</br>   them, so I was like, I don't want to waste my money, because the visa here</br>   costs 4,000, almost 5,000 to get the visa.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Pesos?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, man, that's a lot of money.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: What if they don't give it to me, and I'm going to spend out that</br>   amount? That's why I didn't decide to get the visa. I already had my</br>   passport set up for me to go and get the visa, but they told me that rumor.</br>   Then I was like, &quot;Man, I'm not going to get it,&quot; so that's why.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: When you were back in the States, you said you had two cars. Did you</br>   have a license?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: No. I didn't have anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were careful?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I was really careful. I actually followed the rules. I actually</br>   got the guide from, what's it called it, the transit guide? I can't</br>   remember.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Department of Motor Vehicles? Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. I had the guide. I studied them, I read over the rules.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, motor vehicles. Yeah, yeah, so you knew what to do?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I knew what to do, and I was really careful about everything,</br>   about speed. I watched the speed limit. I always respected. All the time</br>   that I drove over there I never got stopped by a cop or anything.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That’s good.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I was really, really careful because I was like, man, what if I</br>   get stopped or pulled over, if I get a ticket? Maybe I'll pay the ticket,</br>   but you never know what type of police cop you'll get. I did have a lot of</br>   racist people from over there, but I didn't really pay attention to them.</br>   Most of the time I did got in a fight with them, and after that they didn't</br>   bother me no more. I know what people are good to you, and what, some</br>   people that are not good to you. I never took it really personal, but there</br>   was actually one. There was this actually one time that ... I think I was</br>   nine? No, 12, 11 years old. I was on the bus. The bus takes you home. There</br>   was this one big kid, I remember. He was making fun of, and making jokes</br>   about, African people. He was bothering this guy, and I got mad. I stood</br>   up, and I was like, &quot;What have you got to say?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: He's like, &quot;What are you going to do? You're not going to do nothing.</br>   You're Mexican. You beat on yourself like that?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;Man, you think you are tough because you're tall or</br>   whatever? What gives you the right to judge the people? Nobody's judging</br>   you, so you had better leave him alone.&quot; That's why I got in a fight with</br>   him. I didn't know how to do it. He was really tall. He was this tall to</br>   me, and I don't know how I did it, but I took some punches and I won the</br>   fight, basically.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: After a day people were telling me, &quot;Oh, dude, you beat him up,&quot; and</br>   this and that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I was like, &quot;Well, yeah, but he was bothering this guy.&quot; I'm the type</br>   of person that I don't like seeing people bothering other people when they</br>   think they're all that. I don't know. I just don't like that attitude, when</br>   people have that.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. What do you miss most from the US, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: A lot of things. I miss the places, or the lifestyle over there. The</br>   lifestyle is really different. It's really calm. You can do anything. You</br>   can do anything, but not everything here, the rules, the security. Here in</br>   Mexico there's a lot of traffic of drugs, car dealers and stuff. You can't</br>   be really safe sometimes.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: What I miss over there also is just most of the time the lifestyle,</br>   because I lived over there in a small country, a small town, and I could do</br>   anything. I could go fishing, I could go to a lake, play basketball, really</br>   anything, like going to the woods. I miss all that. Basically you can find</br>   the same thing here in Mexico, but it's not the same as over there.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Also, the economy, obviously, the work. I remember that every time we</br>   go out shopping to Walmart, my parents spent $150 or $200, and we bought a</br>   lot of food. It lasted for us for almost two weeks. Here in Mexico, with</br>   2,000 pesos you can buy a lot of food, but it's too expensive. Also, is it</br>   closed?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I mean, what I also miss from over there, everything from over there,</br>   the clothes, the shoes, the cars. I actually liked the motorcycles and</br>   everything. They have good quality, you know? Here in Mexico you can find</br>   anything. You can find the same thing, but not as much good quality, or you</br>   can, but it's really expensive. For example, for shoes, some Nike shoes, I</br>   really like some Nike shoes. Nike shoes are like here they're 3,000 or</br>   4,000 or 5,000 pesos.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Oh, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Over there in the United States, I remember I bought my shoes for</br>   $90, $60.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah, wow.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It was cheaper. The dollar over here is big money, but over there,</br>   I've seen everything is cheaper over there. You can get more stuff, or you</br>   can do more of your own things than here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yeah. That's a lot of money.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Actually, I miss also the people. There's a lot of really nice people</br>   that I met over there. Most of them I really lost touch with them, but I</br>   can't remember why. We're just talking sometimes, but not most of the time</br>   I talk to them. Yeah, that's what I miss.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think going to the United States and living there for ... You</br>   were there for nine years, right?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think that made you a different person than you would have</br>   been if you had you never gone?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah, I do.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How did it make you different? What changed you? How are you</br>   different?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I think the education over there in high school ... Well, in school,</br>   because over there the teachers always used to tell us that we have to be</br>   good. We have to tell the truth, we have to be respectful. We have to be</br>   responsible. And I think I got a lot of helpful [inaudible 00:33:19] over</br>   there from people. They were really nice to me, and they changed my ways,</br>   because I always asked myself that question too. What would have been of me</br>   if I would have never be over there? What would I be, like, what type of</br>   person would I be right now?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: It did change me a lot, I think, because coming back over here was</br>   way too different. I'm actually one of those persons that if you tell me</br>   something, I'll believe it. But then after living here, having a lot of</br>   experience with people that have bad influence, you start getting to know</br>   that there's not always a lot of good people. Yeah, I think that really</br>   changed me, or helped me a lot, living over there.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: I can't really remember myself being as a kid. I can't remember how I</br>   was, but growing up over there, knowing the things, the places and people</br>   that you know, the education from school that you got, I think it's a lot</br>   different than over here. Here in Mexico here it is nice too, but they</br>   don't have really the same education that's over there. Here, people from</br>   Mexico, they do whatever they want. They don't follow the rules, or I don't</br>   know, I just think it's about the education difference. Yeah, I think, I</br>   don’t know. Yeah. I think I'm a honest people, person, I mean. I don't like</br>   to really lie and stuff, or make up things. I just tell what I feel, what</br>   I've been through.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It must have been helpful to have your family here when you came</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: …your mom and dad, and sister and all. Are you living with them now,</br>   or no?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Yeah. Right now I'm living with my parents because ... I used to not</br>   live with them when I was married. I was living on my own. Now that I got</br>   separated, I'm living with them again. I'm planning to be on my own again</br>   for myself, because my sister's there too with her husband and kid. We're</br>   really crowded in there, so it's a lot of issues and problems with them. I</br>   just want to move by my own some day. That's what I'm planning.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So what are your dreams now that you're back? Have they changed? Are</br>   they similar?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Now that I’m here? No, they haven't changed, because I actually want</br>   to keep doing the same thing. Right now I'm still trying to do</br>   instrumentals for music and stuff, like rap, hip hop or anything. I just</br>   want to keep doing that. My dream also here is just to get my house, my own</br>   house, my own car too, just have a family, maybe also buy houses or</br>   apartments and rent them and stuff. That's what my plan is to be, what to</br>   do here. But also I've been thinking about going over there to the United</br>   States, but I don't know how, and I don't know who or where. There's a lot</br>   of people that tell me I can get the visa and stuff. I would do it, but I</br>   mean I think that well… They are giving chances to go there to visit only</br>   for six, seven months, or to work there for a year. I would go back just to</br>   work and make some money, and come back over here and put a business or</br>   something, I don't know. I don't know how things are over there now. It's</br>   been a long time. That's my plan, is to be here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So we're going to end in a minute, but is there anything that you'd</br>   like to share with the people who listen to this recording of your story?</br>   Anything more that you haven't said about your experiences, or experiences</br>   of other returning migrants?</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Well, I think that my experience here, to be coming back over here is</br>   not as big deal. It was really a different way for me to come over here,</br>   because a lot of people that I know from over there ... Well, that I know</br>   here, that they come from over there too. They say that they had to go</br>   through a lot of things. They've been locked up, or they've been reported</br>   for motoring, or selling drugs, or being in a gang, or stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: But my experience, to come back over here to Mexico is ... I don't</br>   know. I always see it as a sign of God, or I don't know. It changed my life</br>   really, really, completely. The way of seeing things too, here from over</br>   there. I don't really have that ... I can't really explain what I mean, to</br>   tell you the experience. I don't know. The experience will be, just for me,</br>   living in another country and switching back in place, and that's it. It's</br>   not that much, because most of the time that I was over there in the United</br>   States, I was referred to as a kid. I don't really remember everything, but</br>   being here, I just had to deal with it and just stay, see what comes up,</br>   yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Thank you. Thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Yair: Oh, thank you.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That was really great.</br> </div><\p>
