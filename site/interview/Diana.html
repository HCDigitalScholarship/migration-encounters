   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would<br>
   get into fights stuff like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so<br>
   exciting about gangs?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,<br>
   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school<br>
   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good<br>
   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over<br>
   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching<br>
   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with<br>
   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of<br>
   alone time.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now</br>   that I am old and different but --</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what was fun about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that</br>   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad</br>   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like</br>   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the</br>   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two</br>   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time</br>   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   <span id="ded8090c-dca7-4dfe-9616-86748338f8e8" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Values">Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Yes, a lot.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: How so?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more<br>
   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see<br>
   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like<br>
   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do<br>
   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got<br>
   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty<br>
   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here<br>
   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of<br>
   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I<br>
   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if<br>
   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there<br>
   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't<br>
   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the<br>
   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.<br>
   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes<br>
   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make<br>
   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a<br>
   lot of people standing there.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here<br>
   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: What food do you miss?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Like which ones?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.<br>
   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that<br>
   before.<br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: About coming back?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: About the U S.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you<br>
   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started<br>
   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are<br>
   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re<br>
   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see<br>
   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not<br>
   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the<br>
   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows<br>
   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.<br>
   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The<br>
   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped<br>
   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack<br>
   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?<br>

 <br>
 <br>

   him when I was 15.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?<br>
 <br>

 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was<br>
   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to<br>
   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,<br>
   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time<br>
   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can<br>
   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into<br>
   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone<br>
   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough<br>
   money to pay for a babysitter.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,<br>

   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to<br>
   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know<br>
   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the<br>
   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty<br>
   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,<br>

The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more.

 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two<br>
   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then<br>
   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time<br>
   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they<br>
   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my<br>
   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the<br>
   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: You got caught?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you<br>
   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And<br>
   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.<br>
   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on<br>
   the car.<br>

   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up<br>
   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at<br>
   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like<br>
   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then<br>
   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with<br>
   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the<br>
   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that<br>
   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you<br>
   out.”<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with<br>

 <br>
   Anita: And the first time you went as a middle schooler?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Yes.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Anita: Was that hard to all of a sudden leave your country?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: Yes, because of the situation. Because my parents split up, and then<br>
   I didn't know what's going on. And then once I was over there I didn't know<br>
   any English. So the first year was hard also because when I went there, I<br>
   had to go back one year from school because I did not know English. And<br>
   then third year, the things that they teach at the bilingual classes, it<br>
   was not on the grade that I was, it was below that. So I think that, that<br>
   got me, I lost interest in school because of that. So I started hanging out<br>
   with bad people and stuff like that.<br>
 <br>
 <br>
  </span> Anita: So how old were you then?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I was 12 when I went there, but then when I was 15 because I was</br>   hanging out with not that good people, my mom sent me back-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So that's why you came back.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: To live with my mom, with my dad, sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So tell me what you did. What trouble did you get in?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Well, when I started hanging out with ... I started getting to the</br>   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would</br>   get into fights stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so</br>   exciting about gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,</br>   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school</br>   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good</br>   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over</br>   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching</br>   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with</br>   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of</br>   alone time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now</br>   that I am old and different but --</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what was fun about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that</br>   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad</br>   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like</br>   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the</br>   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two</br>   years old.

Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How so?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more</br>   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see</br>   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like</br>   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do</br>   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got</br>   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty</br>   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here</br>   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of</br>   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So they follow rules. Are there anything else that's</br>   culturally different, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The way you live over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there you do a lot more things, and mostly it's because of the</br>   income, yeah. Because even though that, let's say we were, did not have</br>   papers and maybe we could not go to a lot of places, but we could go to</br>   places anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean to travel?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, to travel. Maybe because we were so adapted, we actually never</br>   got that many rejection because I do know that some people do get a lot of</br>   rejections so that, actually I get more here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean rejections?</br> </br> </br>   <span id="bffba5f2-ca65-42a1-860e-0bf36ef187e9" style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Diana: Like for example here, this social, the status is way more marked.<br>
   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't<br>
   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot<br>
   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.<br>
   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all<br>
   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and<br>
   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the<br>
   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position<br>
   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's<br>
   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that<br>
   kind of things.<br>

 <br>
   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?<br>
 <br>
 <br>
   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work<br>

 <br>
 <br>

   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the<br>

   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was<br>
   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real<br>
   or anything. I had fake papers.<br>
 <br>

   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was<br>

   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where<br>

Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff.

And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that.

So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time</br>   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How so?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more</br>   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see</br>   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like</br>   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do</br>   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got</br>   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty</br>   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here</br>   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of</br>   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So they follow rules. Are there anything else that's</br>   culturally different, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The way you live over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there you do a lot more things, and mostly it's because of the</br>   income, yeah. Because even though that, let's say we were, did not have</br>   papers and maybe we could not go to a lot of places, but we could go to</br>   places anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean to travel?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, to travel. Maybe because we were so adapted, we actually never</br>   got that many rejection because I do know that some people do get a lot of</br>   rejections so that, actually I get more here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean rejections?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like for example here, this social, the status is way more marked.</br>   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't</br>   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot</br>   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.</br>   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all</br>   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and</br>   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the</br>   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position</br>   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's</br>   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that</br>   kind of things.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who will get it first?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The person that is their friend.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there's more social mobility in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's interesting. Have you faced discrimination since you've been</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. Well, actually I just do it over the phone when I'm calling</br>   sometimes in my job, but I know people are like that, and it's my job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you face discrimination from Americans on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do they say?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That they need to speak with someone that speaks better English,</br>   stuff like that because I do tech support.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what about by Mexicans? Do you face discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really. I mean, just like I was mentioning, in the social</br>   status, the ones that have more money, they look at you more, but I don't</br>   really care about that. I don't pay, I know they're like that, so I don't</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Great, okay.</br> </div><\p>
