So you've been to the</br>   United States twice?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time you went as a middle schooler?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was that hard to all of a sudden leave your country?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, because of the situation. Because my parents split up, and then</br>   I didn't know what's going on. And then once I was over there I didn't know</br>   any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. So <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the first year</span> was hard also because when I went there, I</br>   had to go back one year from school because I did not know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. And</br>   then <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">third year</span>, the things that they teach at the bilingual classes, it</br>   was not on the grade that I was, it was below that. So I think that, that</br>   got me, I lost interest in school because of that. So I started hanging out</br>   with bad people and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So how old were you then?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">12</span> when I went there, but then when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span> because I was</br>   hanging out with not that good people, my mom sent me back-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So that's why you came back.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: To live with my mom, with my dad, sorry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So tell me what you did. What trouble did you get in?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Well, when I started hanging out with ... I started getting to the</br>   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would</br>   get into fights stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so</br>   exciting about gangs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,</br>   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school</br>   because when I was here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I was one of the ones with the good</br>   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over</br>   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching</br>   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with</br>   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of</br>   alone time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now</br>   that I am old and different but --</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But what was fun about it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that</br>   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad</br>   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like</br>   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the</br>   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">The very first month</span>, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">an African American</span>, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So she sends you back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And what was it like crossing the border the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time was more scary because I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">19</span> and my son was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two   years old</span>. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time I crossed by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tijuana</span>, and then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time</br>   we went through <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Sonora</span>. So then it more hard. And then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the U S</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: She stayed there but actually she came back <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">about six years ago</span>, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United   States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, maybe because I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">19</span>, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the   50s</span> or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">AMC</span> movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Conservation Corps</span>. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years old</span>. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night</span>. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, I stay for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">another six months</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: At <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, because I could not just leave my son was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">sixth</span> grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Love?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">21 years</span>. I met</br>   him when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">15</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What's it been like coming back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Why?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: If you speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Did you like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">19</span> now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>. He does speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span></br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Really?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: About <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the U S.</span></br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Oh, about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the U S</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Caesars</span> here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour and 15 minutes</span></br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Do you think that living in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the U S</span> changed you?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: How so?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more</br>   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see</br>   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like</br>   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do</br>   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got</br>   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty</br>   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here</br>   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of</br>   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Yeah. So they follow rules. Are there anything else that's</br>   culturally different, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: The way you live over there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Over there you do a lot more things, and mostly it's because of the</br>   income, yeah. Because even though that, let's say we were, did not have</br>   papers and maybe we could not go to a lot of places, but we could go to</br>   places anyways.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: You mean to travel?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yeah, to travel. Maybe because we were so adapted, we actually never</br>   got that many rejection because I do know that some people do get a lot of</br>   rejections so that, actually I get more here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What do you mean rejections?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Like for example here, this social, the status is way more marked.</br>   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't</br>   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot</br>   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.</br>   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all</br>   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and</br>   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the</br>   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position</br>   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's</br>   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>, that</br>   kind of things.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: Who will get it <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: The person that is their friend.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So, there's more social mobility in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the U S</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: That's interesting. Have you faced discrimination since you've been</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Not that much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: No?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: No. Well, actually I just do it over the phone when I'm calling</br>   sometimes in my job, but I know people are like that, and it's my job.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: So you face discrimination from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Americans</span> on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: What do they say?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: That they need to speak with someone that speaks better <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>,</br>   stuff like that because I do tech support.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span>: And what about by <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span>? Do you face discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Diana</span>: Not really. I mean, just like I was mentioning, in the social</br>   status, the ones that have more money, they look at you more, but I don't</br>   really care about that. I don't pay, I know they're like that, so I don't</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anita</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Camaraderie/family, Family, Fitting in">Diana: Well, when I started hanging out with ... I started getting to the   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would   get into fights stuff like that.     Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so   exciting about gangs?     Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of   alone time.    </span> Anita: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now</br>   that I am old and different but --</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what was fun about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that</br>   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad</br>   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like</br>   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the</br>   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two</br>   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time</br>   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Identity, Values">Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?     Diana: Yes, a lot.     Anita: How so?     Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment, Reflections, Mexico, Worst parts about being back">Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?

So the first year was hard also because when I went there, I   had to go back one year from school because I did not know English. And   then third year, the things that they teach at the bilingual classes, it   was not on the grade that I was, it was below that. So I think that, that   got me, I lost interest in school because of that. So I started hanging out   with bad people and stuff like that.    </span> Anita: So how old were you then?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I was 12 when I went there, but then when I was 15 because I was</br>   hanging out with not that good people, my mom sent me back-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So that's why you came back.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: To live with my mom, with my dad, sorry.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So tell me what you did. What trouble did you get in?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Well, when I started hanging out with ... I started getting to the</br>   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would</br>   get into fights stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so</br>   exciting about gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,</br>   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school</br>   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good</br>   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over</br>   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching</br>   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with</br>   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of</br>   alone time.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now</br>   that I am old and different but --</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what was fun about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that</br>   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad</br>   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like</br>   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the</br>   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my</br>   mom.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two</br>   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time</br>   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How so?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more</br>   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see</br>   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like</br>   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do</br>   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got</br>   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty</br>   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here</br>   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of</br>   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So they follow rules. Are there anything else that's</br>   culturally different, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The way you live over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there you do a lot more things, and mostly it's because of the</br>   income, yeah. Because even though that, let's say we were, did not have</br>   papers and maybe we could not go to a lot of places, but we could go to</br>   places anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean to travel?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, to travel. Maybe because we were so adapted, we actually never</br>   got that many rejection because I do know that some people do get a lot of</br>   rejections so that, actually I get more here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean rejections?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Cultural differences">Diana: Like for example here, this social, the status is way more marked.   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that   kind of things.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Art,  safety, School">Diana: Oh, about the US.

So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,   okay don't know them.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Continuing education, Documents">Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, Struggling, Suspension, Dropping out, Gangs, Activity, Parents/step-parents">Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on   that one.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Camaraderie/family, Fitting in, Family, Bullying">Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Family, Parents/step-parents, Teenage rebellion, Arguments/Estrangement">Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Gangs, Affiliation, Camaraderie/family, Family, Fitting in">Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my   mom.    </span> Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking</br>   you to the US?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation</br>   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.</br>   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was</br>   with the gang, what do you mean?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict</br>   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,</br>   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had</br>   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all</br>   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any</br>   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And</br>   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of</br>   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be– because also</br>   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,</br>   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff</br>   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.</br>   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. Did you have a boyfriend who was a gang member?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But you didn't get pregnant?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How'd you manage that?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I didn't have any sexual relations with him.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You weren't pressured to?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, not by him. So he was actually, he was in a gang, but he</br>   was a pretty nice person. Yeah, we would make out, but it didn't got to a</br>   point that he pressured me to have sex so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So your mother finds out that you're in a gang, and then what</br>   happens?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then that's when ... well, first she noticed because I start</br>   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and</br>   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and</br>   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't</br>   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one</br>   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go</br>   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and</br>   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it</br>   was the one that got food and stuff like that, but she wanted to get on</br>   that one.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: And then we were there and then there was these – they were from my</br>   school; I was already in high school. And then they started pushing up</br>   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at</br>   that moment, I was telling the guy, “What's wrong with you?” and stuff like</br>   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then</br>   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with</br>   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the</br>   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that</br>   and she was like, “No, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you</br>   out.”</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with</br>   knives or what?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And then you go back again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work</br>   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she</br>   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to</br>   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was</br>   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she</br>   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where</br>   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just</br>   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: This time you got-</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, and this time I got pregnant and then we start living</br>   together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two</br>   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then</br>   it was also – the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time</br>   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they</br>   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my</br>   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the</br>   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You got caught?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you</br>   know the coyotes, they told us, “Okay, go back here,” and everything. And</br>   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.</br>   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on</br>   the car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you were with your son?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom</br>   for a little bit.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was she happy to see you again?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. Well actually she was the one that help us with the money</br>   first, because it was like a lot of money to go together. But the first</br>   option was actually to just go me and my husband, to work, make money, come</br>   back. And we were going to leave my son with my mother-in-law. But my mom</br>   was like, “No that's not a good idea and if I help you, I help the three of</br>   you guys, because it's not a good idea to leave your son.” Now I know that</br>   was the correct choice.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your mother had stayed then this whole time in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: She stayed there but actually she came back about six years ago, so</br>   now she's living-</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But your whole time when you were back here, she was in the United</br>   States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: I see, okay. So this time you come back, you're an adult, you go</br>   live with your mom and you find a job doing all these jobs as?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job</br>   of all.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work</br>   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants</br>   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the</br>   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that</br>   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was</br>   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real</br>   or anything. I had fake papers.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to</br>   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know</br>   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the</br>   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty</br>   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,</br>   okay don't know them.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Don't ask, don't tell?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, don't ask don't tell.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, I had wondered about that. They don't really care.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, they don't, because at my last job, over there when I went to</br>   ____ in the movie theaters, they hire me. The movie theaters, it was the</br>   AMC movie theaters, so they did hire me. But then when I went out to ____,</br>   I worked through agencies, so then they would send me to a factory, but the</br>   last one, they did hire me. After a while they hire me. I was not working</br>   through the agency no more. I was not a temp no more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Were most of the people you were working with in a similar situation</br>   undocumented?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the factories, yes. In the movie theaters, no because in the</br>   movie theaters, there was more teenagers and stuff like. Normal people. I</br>   think I was the only one undocumented there. Yeah, in the movie theaters.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So then what does your husband do?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Right now?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there? Over there, he started working, when we were in ____, he</br>   started working at the _____ Conservation Corps. He was there, they tell</br>   them, finish the GED. They also do work, like mostly community work because</br>   they build bike racks around the city, stuff like that. And they cut grass</br>   and stuff like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was</br>   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to</br>   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,</br>   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time</br>   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can</br>   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into</br>   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone</br>   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough</br>   money to pay for a babysitter.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,</br>   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Wow. So your husband, I'll talk to him, he gets stopped for a</br>   traffic violation and he gets to court.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And you stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I stay for another six months.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why did you decide to stay?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At first, because I could not just leave my son was in sixth grade,</br>   and also that was a hard decision because he was either staying over there</br>   or coming back. Coming back was... because we had always been together, so</br>   by that it was because since he got deported, he cannot go back, if he</br>   tries to cross, they want to put him in jail right away. So supposedly he</br>   has dangers, probation, but I'm not sure if after that he'd be able to have</br>   a visa or something like that.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You just stayed so your son could finish his school?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you think of staying longer without your husband?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, I thought so. I thought about it, but then I don't know, I was</br>   like, no, we have to be together.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Love?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: It does these things.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, it does things, yeah. And then since I was mentioning, we</br>   always been together. Actually, we've been together now for 21 years. I met</br>   him when I was 15.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Oh my God. And things are good?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes. We have problems and other thing, but we've been always</br>   together in the good times, the bad times so ...</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What's it been like coming back to Mexico, what was it like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: At the beginning, it was really hard.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Why?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Because I did not ... we got so adapted to the living over there, is</br>   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are</br>   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of</br>   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to</br>   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think</br>   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the</br>   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you</br>   have more opportunities, they treat you different.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: If you speak English?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Did you like the United States?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, I like it a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What did you like?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I liked how it was more easier. If you work hard, you get stuff</br>   faster, you have things. Also, because my son was over there. Actually, he</br>   wants to go back. Yeah, he's 19 now so he wants to go back. He doesn't</br>   adapt to the living here. He doesn't like Spanish. He does speak Spanish</br>   but he speaks with an accent.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Really?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah. And then he doesn't try that much because he doesn't like it.</br>   And then he had a bad experience here when he went back to school here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: But what did you like about it?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: About coming back?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: About the U S.</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you</br>   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started</br>   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are</br>   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re</br>   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see</br>   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not</br>   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the</br>   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows</br>   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.</br>   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The</br>   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped</br>   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack</br>   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Your son's?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah, anything else you liked or you miss from the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The food, some of the food. That is because some of the food here</br>   now we have it, is not, but is more expensive.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What food do you miss?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: There's some buffets over there that I like.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Like which ones?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like the old country buffet, I imagine, that one I liked it a lot.</br>   Now they had little Caesars here but before they didn't and I missed that</br>   before.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I</br>   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if</br>   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there</br>   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't</br>   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the</br>   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.</br>   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes</br>   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make</br>   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a</br>   lot of people standing there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes, a lot.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: How so?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more</br>   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see</br>   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like</br>   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do</br>   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got</br>   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty</br>   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here</br>   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of</br>   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Yeah. So they follow rules. Are there anything else that's</br>   culturally different, do you think?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The way you live over there.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Mm-hmm (affirmative).</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Over there you do a lot more things, and mostly it's because of the</br>   income, yeah. Because even though that, let's say we were, did not have</br>   papers and maybe we could not go to a lot of places, but we could go to</br>   places anyways.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: You mean to travel?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yeah, to travel. Maybe because we were so adapted, we actually never</br>   got that many rejection because I do know that some people do get a lot of</br>   rejections so that, actually I get more here.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do you mean rejections?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Like for example here, this social, the status is way more marked.</br>   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't</br>   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot</br>   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.</br>   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all</br>   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and</br>   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the</br>   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position</br>   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's</br>   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that</br>   kind of things.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Who will get it first?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: The person that is their friend.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So, there's more social mobility in the U S?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: That's interesting. Have you faced discrimination since you've been</br>   back?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not that much.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: No?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: No. Well, actually I just do it over the phone when I'm calling</br>   sometimes in my job, but I know people are like that, and it's my job.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: So you face discrimination from Americans on the phone?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: What do they say?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: That they need to speak with someone that speaks better English,</br>   stuff like that because I do tech support.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: And what about by Mexicans? Do you face discrimination?</br> </br> </br>   Diana: Not really. I mean, just like I was mentioning, in the social</br>   status, the ones that have more money, they look at you more, but I don't</br>   really care about that. I don't pay, I know they're like that, so I don't</br>   care.</br> </br> </br>   Anita: Great, okay.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
