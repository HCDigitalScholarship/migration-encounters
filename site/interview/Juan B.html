My dad, I don't</br>   know why he chose <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Utah</span>, but in specific, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Provo</span>. That's where I grew up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Provo</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Provo</span> [Chuckles]. What my dad always says is that he wanted to</br>   provide us with a better future because my dad comes from outside of the</br>   city, like the states in the south of <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. He lives in the small</br>   villages where the houses are still made out of mud or their houses are</br>   barely standing—where the actual <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture comes from. I guess we</br>   could say the indigenous people. That's the kind of place that my dad was</br>   coming from. He just wanted to provide us with a better future than he</br>   could provide us here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. He wanted us to go with him to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> and</br>   to be able to create a better future and better opportunity for us.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Were you living in that rural area before you left?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: No, before I left, I was living here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, but not in the</br>   center. I was living in the outside of the center, where they were barely</br>   making houses. In a way it is, as well, rural parts because the conditions</br>   that we lived in weren't the best. We did have a roof over our heads and we</br>   did have food, but things could have been better when I was younger.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What did your dad do when he was working in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Utah</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: From what my dad told me is, initially, he worked in a farm… I think</br>   it was strawberries, something to do with fruit. He would pick them out,</br>   but I think he was there for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year, a year and a half</span>, he saw that he</br>   wasn't making much money so he started to get into the construction</br>   industry. That's where he was able to save up money so we can go with him,</br>   and after that, he's always been in the construction industry.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you cross the border with your family?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: No, so my mom, she did have to walk when she crossed the border,</br>   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the</br>   mountains. My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons</br>   who looked like us. What she did is when it was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">night time</span>—I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eight</span>, my</br>   brother was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nine</span>, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like</br>   any other family, we crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let</br>   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,</br>   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three weeks</span>. From what she</br>   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever</br>   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because</br>   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones</br>   that was able to make it back to their families.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It's a rugged trek.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You immediately went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Provo</span>, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Utah</span>. Did you know any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: No, when I went to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Utah</span>, I went into <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">4th</span> grade and then I didn't know</br>   any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. What did help was that the elementary that I went to, they had</br>   an ESL—I think it's English Second Language—available for people who didn't</br>   know any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>, so that helped out a lot. My brother and I didn't know</br>   any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. My mom didn't know any <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. My dad didn't know any</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. It was just rough.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long did it take to learn?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>,</br>   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I</br>   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able</br>   to practice my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that</br>   natives spoke it. But it took me <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">10 years</span> to be able to—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were studying in an <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> school.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You just felt your <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> skills were not great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, they weren't great.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did you make friends in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and</br>   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's</br>   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.</br>   The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Caucasian</span> kids, they just didn't accept them—as in, for me, they did</br>   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my</br>   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I did see that other kids who had the same situation as me, they</br>   didn't get accepted because—I don't know in that scenario what people</br>   looked at or why it was that I was lucky to get accepted when others</br>   didn't.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How about your brother?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,</br>   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to</br>   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles</br>   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds. We just wanted to learn</br>   from the different culture. We didn't really struggle that much to adapt,</br>   but then again, there's other people who do struggle.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I still remember in high school, my high school friends—I was in the</br>   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but</br>   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries</br>   from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LOC">Latin America</span>, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to</br>   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their</br>   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They would tell them, &quot;Go back to your country,” or “You can't even</br>   speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> right.&quot; Even if I didn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> right, they wouldn't</br>   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that</br>   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really</br>   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my</br>   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people</br>   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. Even though <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> was a struggle, I always tried my best, and</br>   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in</br>   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for</br>   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that</br>   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.</br>   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What position do you play?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got</br>   back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I</br>   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here</br>   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just</br>   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and</br>   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were</br>   to be playing with my friends in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, so I don't know. It's been <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year</span>,</br>   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's too bad.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I used to be really into the teams, but not anymore. Right now my</br>   focus is on other things and on the things that I used to think of. Right</br>   now, I'd rather focus on other things than keeping up with teams.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What was family life like with you and your brother and your mother</br>   and father? Did you guys speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> at home? Did you do <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> things,</br>   activities? Do they work a lot? Tell me a little bit about family life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's</br>   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Utah</span>, with the</br>   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in</br>   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or</br>   even if it rains, even if it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="QUANTITY">minus five degrees</span> outside, he still goes</br>   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for</br>   his family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who</br>   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family. In my</br>   house we spoke <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> all the time because of my mom. To this day, she</br>   doesn't want to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> even though we tell her to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span>. My</br>   little sister, she doesn't speak <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, she speaks more <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">English</span> and with</br>   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> because it's</br>   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is she a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, she was born in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. So my parents didn't really adapt to the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">American</span> culture. They always wanted to follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> traditions, even</br>   when it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Mother's Day</span> over there … I think here it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">May 10th</span> but over</br>   there, when is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Mother's Day</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: I think it's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the second Sunday of May</span>, so it could be different days.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Mother's Day</span></br>   here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> than over there. Also <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Christmas</span>, I guess the one thing they</br>   did adapt to was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Thanksgiving</span>. We don't celebrate that here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, but</br>   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter</br>   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?</br>   They adapted to that, but here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> they don't do that. They don't</br>   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> culture</br>   alive even though they were in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, but they also wanted to adapt to the</br>   things that they did there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You were enjoying school to some extent, and soccer. Did you get in</br>   trouble at all?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: When I was in high school, I did get in trouble because I did get in</br>   a couple of fights, but to the extent to say that I was a trouble maker or</br>   I wasn't disciplined, or to say that I didn't care about school, no. I</br>   consider myself not a good kid because I did get in trouble, but a kid who</br>   cared for his well being as in school-wise. I wanted to graduate, I wanted</br>   to continue to college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">Twenty four</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You wanted to go off to college, but that didn't happen or did it</br>   happen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Right now I am in college.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: In the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, it didn't happen?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: My plan was, when I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">16</span> I had received DACA. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.</br>   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to</br>   work.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A permit to work.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for</br>   one or two years, save up money, then go to college. That was my plan, but</br>   a situation happened—I think I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty</span>. No, I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span> about to be</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty</span>. I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all</br>   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and</br>   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and</br>   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree</br>   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree</br>   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my</br>   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span> with a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree charge</br>   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I was in jail for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five months</span> fighting my case and then they found</br>   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: They found out you weren't guilty.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that</br>   since it was a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This</br>   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're</br>   in jail—that when you have a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree felony, they drop it down to a</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">second</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">third</span> degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?</br>   Yes, a plea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A plea.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my</br>   record. From a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent</br>   after <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five months</span> [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a</br>   misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in</br>   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained</br>   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going</br>   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.</br>   They're going to want me to take <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> charge at least. So, what they did</br>   was, from a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span>-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean</br>   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,</br>   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the</br>   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from</br>   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,</br>   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but</br>   immigration got me right there.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Immigration got me, they removed my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">DACA</span>, and after that I started my</br>   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">eight months</span>. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">Five</span></br>   with the state then <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">three</span> with immigration. I think I would have been able</br>   to stay if I was married to a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had</br>   something that tied me to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. But since I was <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">nineteen</span>, I wasn't</br>   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: The Class A misdemeanor, that's <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the misdemeanors that is</br>   disqualifying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to</br>   happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LAW">DACA</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could</br>   expunge from your record?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.</br>   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you</br>   lose, then you can look up to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty years</span> in prison. But if you win, you</br>   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it</br>   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">a year and a   half</span> in jail, and I was already <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">five months</span> in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't</br>   want to be here anymore.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated</br>   accusation?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was</br>   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or</br>   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: A bond?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $<span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="MONEY">10,000</span> bond. Then my dad came</br>   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: It was something that, like I said, I'm just glad it's over with but</br>   it's an experience that I went through that sometimes I do hate myself for</br>   putting myself in that situation because I could say, &quot;Well, maybe that</br>   night I should've just stayed home. I shouldn't have gone out and I</br>   should've just…&quot; Because at that time, I had a good job. My brother was</br>   doing good, my family was doing good, my parents, they would go camping</br>   every weekend or they would go fishing. They would go out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I would provide help financially to my parents, so we were all doing</br>   good. My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our</br>   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.</br>   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that</br>   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just</br>   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span></br>   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He</br>   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,</br>   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;</br>   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what</br>   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind</br>   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't</br>   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like</br>   that. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How long have you been back?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I've been here for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three years</span>.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Is it hard?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and</br>   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I</br>   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just</br>   recently, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two weeks ago</span>, I quit my job so I can start to look into …</br>   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own</br>   company, and I don't know if you met <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Mauricio</span>, he's one of the teachers</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his</br>   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an</br>   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> of all, finish my career</br>   and then start off <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Airbnb</span>. We're looking into that. We're looking for a</br>   potential house in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Tepoztlán</span>, which is <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="TIME">an hour and a half</span> from here, which</br>   is a really tourist part.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the</br>   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school</br>   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents</br>   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it</br>   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both</br>   ways. I could've come back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and then I could've been in depression</br>   and started hanging out with the wrong people.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.</br>   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,</br>   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to</br>   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've</br>   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for</br>   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with</br>   architecture.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of</br>   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build</br>   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Ixtapaluca</span>,</br>   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really</br>   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses</br>   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I</br>   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because</br>   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they</br>   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.</br>   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to</br>   give back to my community, make it grow.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Because there's a lot of potential in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> that I didn't see</br>   because I was in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home</br>   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I</br>   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an</br>   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills</br>   that I'm developing right now.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That you're studying in school?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to … Right now, I'm</br>   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses</br>   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Colombia</span> and they have</br>   another method of, here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico City</span>, making houses out of plastic. I</br>   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes</br>   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that</br>   I want to give back to my community.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and</br>   go back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer</br>   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I</br>   love <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,</br>   because of the politics, the corruption, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> isn't so well. I know me,</br>   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I</br>   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great</br>   dreams.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Do you think being in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> changed your life, changed you in any</br>   significant ways?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, because I lived in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Provo</span>, where all the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mormons</span> are, and most of</br>   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.</br>   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way</br>   people are here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I don't know if you've met <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> who are from</br>   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a</br>   lot different than a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> citizen. They have different thoughts, different</br>   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, because the way</br>   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to</br>   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be</br>   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,</br>   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.</br>   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> because I do have a</br>   different lookout in life.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What do you miss most about the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> I can go out</br>   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: It's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: So a couple of things to reflect on. When we talked to young men</br>   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span></br>   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal</br>   behavior. You did not.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: No.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: What do you think the difference was?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I don't know. I guess some people… I would say my dad, he provided me</br>   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since</br>   we were little, we were <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">nine</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">ten</span>, he would make us go to work with him,</br>   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even</br>   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you</br>   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang</br>   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> of my</br>   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">two years</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">three   years</span>, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a</br>   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,</br>   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that</br>   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't</br>   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new</br>   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang</br>   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents</br>   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was</br>   abusive.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or</br>   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself</br>   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from</br>   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do</br>   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people</br>   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted</br>   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my</br>   mind.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in</br>   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the</br>   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in</br>   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for</br>   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing</br>   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out</br>   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go</br>   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,</br>   maybe look into those parents and help them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't</br>   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in</br>   the US for <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">twenty years</span> now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been</br>   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">the twenty years</span></br>   he's been there, he's maybe had <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span> or <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">five</span>. People like that, or like my</br>   mom, who's a home … How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of</br>   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not</br>   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.</br>   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who</br>   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who</br>   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But</br>   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking</br>   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A</br>   program for them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: You go back to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and you got to college. Was it hard making that</br>   transition?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I</br>   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that</br>   I went to the state’s—I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">the Provo School District</span>. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came</br>   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come</br>   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what</br>   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: They're like, &quot;It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't</br>   want to do it.&quot; I thought of my future and I was like, &quot;No, I've got to get</br>   this done,&quot; so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting</br>   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or</br>   how do you say it? Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Validated.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Get it validated, and it did take <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DATE">six months</span> but I got the answer</br>   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the</br>   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, and my</br>   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't</br>   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">six</span></br>   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> class.</br>   That was in my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORDINAL">first</span> semester and it was history.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Because, again, going back to the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span>, it wasn't so good, that I</br>   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="LANGUAGE">Spanish</span> is a lot better and,</br>   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In</br>   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and</br>   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,</br>   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">Airbnb</span>. I'm</br>   looking to finishing my career strong and start my quest as an</br>   entrepreneur.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. It sounds like you've got great goals and that you'll</br>   be able to achieve them. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">One</span> last question before we end. Do you think</br>   there's anything the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government should do to help people coming</br>   back from <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">the United States</span> to integrate into society? Are there things</br>   that you see that are important to that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Yes. There's a lot of things that the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexican</span> government can do.</br>   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to</br>   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a</br>   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,</br>   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't</br>   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I know <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span> helps people who … Sometimes they do go to the</br>   airport and they do welcome them to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>. I haven't seen any other</br>   community do that for their own people. <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="ORG">New Comienzos</span> does stand out</br>   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had</br>   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like</br>   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new</br>   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with</br>   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government</br>   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program</br>   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't</br>   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can</br>   have this at home.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way</br>   people see things here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, have them have a different point of view</br>   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things</br>   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of</br>   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a</br>   lot of things that just— we all see positive things, but with all the</br>   corruption here in <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or</br>   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different</br>   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change</br>   anything. It's more of a <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> thing. I guess we're not going so far; we</br>   have <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span> right now. I'm not sure how you guys feel about <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span>. The way I</br>   see, we provide power to the wrong people all the time.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: As a community, we always do wrong. When I was in the <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>, we had</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Bernie</span>. I love <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Bernie</span>, I wish he would have been president, but they chose</br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Hillary</span> instead, and <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Hillary</span> lost against <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Trump</span>. Then I come to <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span>, and</br>   we had all hopes that this new government was going to do positive things.</br>   He is making a change, but it's going downhill right now. My long-term goal</br>   is to be able to change the way people view things, because <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="NORP">Mexicans</span> can be</br>   selfish, they can be ignorant.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: That's because that's how they were taught since they were little.</br>   What I want to do is change <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">Mexico</span> and take out all the potential that we</br>   have, because we have so much potential, we just don't do it, so does the</br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span>. The <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="GPE">US</span> has so much potential, <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="CARDINAL">one</span> of the top ones with the potential,</br>   but because of right now with the leaders that we have, we're not able to</br>   provide it. Then again, I guess that's overall as a society. We want to</br>   change this, let's change this or change that, but we can't, because the</br>   person who is ruling is not going to … They have other things in priority.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: Maybe you'll be a president.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span>: I want to be president, but I want to make a change [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Anne</span>: That's great. Well, thank you very much.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #03fc41" class="entity" value="PERSON">Juan</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Migration from Mexico, Reasons, Economic">Juan: Initially when I was five years old, my dad went to the US to work.   He was there for three years, and then he was able to save up money to have   my brother and my mom cross the border and be with him. My dad, I don't   know why he chose Utah, but in specific, Provo. That's where I grew up.     Anne: Provo.     Juan: Yes, Provo [Chuckles]. What my dad always says is that he wanted to   provide us with a better future because my dad comes from outside of the   city, like the states in the south of Mexico. He lives in the small   villages where the houses are still made out of mud or their houses are   barely standing—where the actual Mexican culture comes from. I guess we   could say the indigenous people. That's the kind of place that my dad was   coming from. He just wanted to provide us with a better future than he   could provide us here in Mexico. He wanted us to go with him to the US and   to be able to create a better future and better opportunity for us.    </span> Anne: Were you living in that rural area before you left?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, before I left, I was living here in Mexico City, but not in the</br>   center. I was living in the outside of the center, where they were barely</br>   making houses. In a way it is, as well, rural parts because the conditions</br>   that we lived in weren't the best. We did have a roof over our heads and we</br>   did have food, but things could have been better when I was younger.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did your dad do when he was working in Utah?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: From what my dad told me is, initially, he worked in a farm… I think</br>   it was strawberries, something to do with fruit. He would pick them out,</br>   but I think he was there for a year, a year and a half, he saw that he</br>   wasn't making much money so he started to get into the construction</br>   industry. That's where he was able to save up money so we can go with him,</br>   and after that, he's always been in the construction industry.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you cross the border with your family?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, so my mom, she did have to walk when she crossed the border,</br>   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the</br>   mountains. My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons</br>   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time—I was eight, my</br>   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like</br>   any other family, we crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let</br>   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,</br>   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she</br>   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever</br>   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because</br>   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones</br>   that was able to make it back to their families.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a rugged trek.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You immediately went to Provo, Utah. Did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, when I went to Utah, I went into 4th grade and then I didn't know</br>   any English. What did help was that the elementary that I went to, they had</br>   an ESL—I think it's English Second Language—available for people who didn't</br>   know any English, so that helped out a lot. My brother and I didn't know</br>   any English. My mom didn't know any English. My dad didn't know any</br>   English. It was just rough.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to learn?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my English,</br>   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I</br>   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able</br>   to practice my English on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that</br>   natives spoke it. But it took me 10 years to be able to—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were studying in an English school.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just felt your English skills were not great.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, they weren't great.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and</br>   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's</br>   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.</br>   The Caucasian kids, they just didn't accept them—as in, for me, they did</br>   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my</br>   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I did see that other kids who had the same situation as me, they</br>   didn't get accepted because—I don't know in that scenario what people</br>   looked at or why it was that I was lucky to get accepted when others</br>   didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,</br>   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to</br>   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles</br>   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds. We just wanted to learn</br>   from the different culture. We didn't really struggle that much to adapt,</br>   but then again, there's other people who do struggle.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I still remember in high school, my high school friends—I was in the</br>   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but</br>   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries</br>   from Latin America, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to</br>   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their</br>   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They would tell them, &quot;Go back to your country,” or “You can't even</br>   speak English right.&quot; Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't</br>   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that</br>   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really</br>   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my</br>   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people</br>   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Even though English was a struggle, I always tried my best, and</br>   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in</br>   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for</br>   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that</br>   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.</br>   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What position do you play?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got</br>   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I</br>   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here</br>   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just</br>   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and</br>   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were</br>   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,</br>   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's too bad.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I used to be really into the teams, but not anymore. Right now my</br>   focus is on other things and on the things that I used to think of. Right</br>   now, I'd rather focus on other things than keeping up with teams.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was family life like with you and your brother and your mother</br>   and father? Did you guys speak English at home? Did you do American things,</br>   activities? Do they work a lot? Tell me a little bit about family life.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's</br>   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the</br>   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in</br>   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or</br>   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes</br>   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for</br>   his family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who</br>   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family. In my</br>   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she</br>   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My</br>   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with</br>   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn Spanish because it's</br>   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the</br>   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even</br>   when it's Mother's Day over there … I think here it's May 10th but over</br>   there, when is Mother's Day?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day</br>   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they</br>   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but</br>   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter</br>   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?</br>   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't</br>   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture</br>   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the</br>   things that they did there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were enjoying school to some extent, and soccer. Did you get in</br>   trouble at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I was in high school, I did get in trouble because I did get in</br>   a couple of fights, but to the extent to say that I was a trouble maker or</br>   I wasn't disciplined, or to say that I didn't care about school, no. I</br>   consider myself not a good kid because I did get in trouble, but a kid who</br>   cared for his well being as in school-wise. I wanted to graduate, I wanted</br>   to continue to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Twenty four.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You wanted to go off to college, but that didn't happen or did it</br>   happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now I am in college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US, it didn't happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the</br>   first ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.</br>   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first</br>   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to</br>   work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A permit to work.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for</br>   one or two years, save up money, then go to college. That was my plan, but</br>   a situation happened—I think I was twenty. No, I was nineteen about to be</br>   twenty. I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all</br>   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and</br>   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you Juan?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and</br>   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a first-degree</br>   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a first-degree</br>   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my</br>   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge</br>   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found</br>   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They found out you weren't guilty.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that</br>   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This</br>   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're</br>   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a</br>   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?</br>   Yes, a plea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A plea.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my</br>   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent</br>   after five months [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a</br>   misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in</br>   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained</br>   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going</br>   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.</br>   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did</br>   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean</br>   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,</br>   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the</br>   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from</br>   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,</br>   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but</br>   immigration got me right there.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my</br>   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five</br>   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able</br>   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had</br>   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't</br>   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the</br>   US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is</br>   disqualifying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to</br>   happen.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could</br>   expunge from your record?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.</br>   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you</br>   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you</br>   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it</br>   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a</br>   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't</br>   want to be here anymore.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated</br>   accusation?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was</br>   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or</br>   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A bond?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $10,000 bond. Then my dad came</br>   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It was something that, like I said, I'm just glad it's over with but</br>   it's an experience that I went through that sometimes I do hate myself for</br>   putting myself in that situation because I could say, &quot;Well, maybe that</br>   night I should've just stayed home. I shouldn't have gone out and I</br>   should've just…&quot; Because at that time, I had a good job. My brother was</br>   doing good, my family was doing good, my parents, they would go camping</br>   every weekend or they would go fishing. They would go out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I would provide help financially to my parents, so we were all doing</br>   good. My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our</br>   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.</br>   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that</br>   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just</br>   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they first</br>   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He</br>   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,</br>   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;</br>   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what</br>   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind</br>   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't</br>   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like</br>   that. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long have you been back?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I've been here for three years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to Mexico and</br>   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I</br>   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just</br>   recently, two weeks ago, I quit my job so I can start to look into …</br>   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own</br>   company, and I don't know if you met Mauricio, he's one of the teachers</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his</br>   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an</br>   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, first of all, finish my career</br>   and then start off Airbnb. We're looking into that. We're looking for a</br>   potential house in Tepoztlán, which is an hour and a half from here, which</br>   is a really tourist part.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the</br>   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school</br>   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents</br>   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it</br>   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both</br>   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression</br>   and started hanging out with the wrong people.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.</br>   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,</br>   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to</br>   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've</br>   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for</br>   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with</br>   architecture.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of</br>   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build</br>   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,</br>   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really</br>   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses</br>   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I</br>   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because</br>   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every</br>   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they</br>   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.</br>   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to</br>   give back to my community, make it grow.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see</br>   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home</br>   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I</br>   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an</br>   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills</br>   that I'm developing right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That you're studying in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to … Right now, I'm</br>   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses</br>   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in Colombia and they have</br>   another method of, here in Mexico City, making houses out of plastic. I</br>   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes</br>   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that</br>   I want to give back to my community.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and</br>   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer</br>   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I</br>   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,</br>   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,</br>   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I</br>   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great</br>   dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US changed your life, changed you in any</br>   significant ways?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, because I lived in Provo, where all the Mormons are, and most of</br>   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.</br>   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way</br>   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from</br>   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a</br>   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different</br>   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way</br>   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to</br>   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be</br>   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,</br>   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.</br>   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US because I do have a</br>   different lookout in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the US I can go out</br>   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So a couple of things to reflect on. When we talked to young men</br>   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the US</br>   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal</br>   behavior. You did not.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you think the difference was?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know. I guess some people… I would say my dad, he provided me</br>   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since</br>   we were little, we were nine or ten, he would make us go to work with him,</br>   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even</br>   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you</br>   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang</br>   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. One of my</br>   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for two years or three</br>   years, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a</br>   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,</br>   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that</br>   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't</br>   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new</br>   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang</br>   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents</br>   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was</br>   abusive.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or</br>   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself</br>   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from</br>   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do</br>   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people</br>   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted</br>   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my</br>   mind.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in</br>   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the</br>   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in</br>   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for</br>   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing</br>   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out</br>   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go</br>   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,</br>   maybe look into those parents and help them.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't</br>   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in</br>   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been</br>   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years</br>   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my</br>   mom, who's a home … How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of</br>   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not</br>   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.</br>   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who</br>   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who</br>   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But</br>   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking</br>   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A</br>   program for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You go back to Mexico and you got to college. Was it hard making that</br>   transition?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I</br>   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that</br>   I went to the state’s—I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by</br>   the Provo School District. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came</br>   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come</br>   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what</br>   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They're like, &quot;It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't</br>   want to do it.&quot; I thought of my future and I was like, &quot;No, I've got to get</br>   this done,&quot; so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting</br>   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or</br>   how do you say it? Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Get it validated, and it did take six months but I got the answer</br>   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the</br>   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in Spanish, and my</br>   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't</br>   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the six</br>   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed one class.</br>   That was in my first semester and it was history.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, going back to the Spanish, it wasn't so good, that I</br>   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my Spanish is a lot better and,</br>   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In</br>   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and</br>   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,</br>   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the Airbnb. I'm</br>   looking to finishing my career strong and start my quest as an</br>   entrepreneur.</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Migrants">Anne: That's great. It sounds like you've got great goals and that you'll   be able to achieve them. One last question before we end. Do you think   there's anything the Mexican government should do to help people coming   back from the United States to integrate into society? Are there things   that you see that are important to that?     Juan: Yes. There's a lot of things that the Mexican government can do.   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.     Juan: I know New Comienzos helps people who … Sometimes they do go to the   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else   to help me out.     Juan: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can   have this at home.     Juan: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a   lot of things that just— we all see positive things, but with all the   corruption here in Mexico, it's hard.     Juan: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change   anything. It's more of a Mexico thing. I guess we're not going so far; we   have Trump right now. I'm not sure how you guys feel about Trump. The way I   see, we provide power to the wrong people all the time.    </span> <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, The United States, Mexico, Feelings, Dreams">Juan: As a community, we always do wrong. When I was in the US, we had   Bernie. I love Bernie, I wish he would have been president, but they chose   Hillary instead, and Hillary lost against Trump. Then I come to Mexico, and   we had all hopes that this new government was going to do positive things.   He is making a change, but it's going downhill right now. My long-term goal   is to be able to change the way people view things, because Mexicans can be   selfish, they can be ignorant.     Juan: That's because that's how they were taught since they were little.   What I want to do is change Mexico and take out all the potential that we   have, because we have so much potential, we just don't do it, so does the   US. The US has so much potential, one of the top ones with the potential,   but because of right now with the leaders that we have, we're not able to   provide it. Then again, I guess that's overall as a society. We want to   change this, let's change this or change that, but we can't, because the   person who is ruling is not going to … They have other things in priority.     Anne: Maybe you'll be a president.     Juan: I want to be president, but I want to make a change [Chuckles].     Anne: That's great. Well, thank you very much.

Then I come to Mexico, and   we had all hopes that this new government was going to do positive things.   He is making a change, but it's going downhill right now. My long-term goal   is to be able to change the way people view things, because Mexicans can be   selfish, they can be ignorant.     Juan: That's because that's how they were taught since they were little.   What I want to do is change Mexico and take out all the potential that we   have, because we have so much potential, we just don't do it, so does the   US. The US has so much potential, one of the top ones with the potential,   but because of right now with the leaders that we have, we're not able to   provide it. Then again, I guess that's overall as a society. We want to   change this, let's change this or change that, but we can't, because the   person who is ruling is not going to … They have other things in priority.     Anne: Maybe you'll be a president.     Juan: I want to be president, but I want to make a change [Chuckles].     Anne: That's great. Well, thank you very much.

Was it hard making that   transition?     Juan: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that   I went to the state’s—I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by   the Provo School District. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.     Juan: They're like, &quot;It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't   want to do it.&quot; I thought of my future and I was like, &quot;No, I've got to get   this done,&quot; so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or   how do you say it? Validated.     Anne: Validated.     Juan: Get it validated, and it did take six months but I got the answer   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in Spanish, and my   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the six   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed one class.   That was in my first semester and it was history.     Juan: Because, again, going back to the Spanish, it wasn't so good, that I   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my Spanish is a lot better and,   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the Airbnb.

When we talked to young men   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the US   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal   behavior. You did not.     Juan: No.     Anne: What do you think the difference was?     Juan: I don't know. I guess some people… I would say my dad, he provided me   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since   we were little, we were nine or ten, he would make us go to work with him,   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for   you.     Juan: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. One of my   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for two years or three   years, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.     Juan: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was   abusive.     Juan: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my   mind.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Parents/step-parents">Anne: So a couple of things to reflect on.

So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.

Juan: I've been here for three years.     Anne: Is it hard?     Juan: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to Mexico and   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just   recently, two weeks ago, I quit my job so I can start to look into …   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own   company, and I don't know if you met Mauricio, he's one of the teachers   here.     Anne: Yes.     Juan: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, first of all, finish my career   and then start off Airbnb. We're looking into that. We're looking for a   potential house in Tepoztlán, which is an hour and a half from here, which   is a really tourist part.     Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression   and started hanging out with the wrong people.     Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with   architecture.     Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.     Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?     Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to   give back to my community, make it grow.     Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills   that I'm developing right now.     Anne: That you're studying in school?     Juan: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to … Right now, I'm   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in Colombia and they have   another method of, here in Mexico City, making houses out of plastic. I   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that   I want to give back to my community.     Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.     Anne: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great   dreams.     Juan: Yes [Chuckles].    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, Higher Education, Dreaming about, Arrests, Misdemeanors, False Accusations, Prison, Feelings, Sadness, Tragedy, Disappointment, Despair, Regret, Dreams">Anne: In the US, it didn't happen?     Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the   first ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—     Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?     Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to   work.     Anne: A permit to work.     Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for   one or two years, save up money, then go to college. That was my plan, but   a situation happened—I think I was twenty. No, I was nineteen about to be   twenty. I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you Juan?&quot;     Juan: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a first-degree   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a first-degree   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.     Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—     Anne: They found out you weren't guilty.     Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?   Yes, a plea.     Anne: A plea.     Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent   after five months [Chuckles].     Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a   misdemeanor?     Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A   misdemeanor.     Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but   immigration got me right there.     Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the   US.     Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is   disqualifying for DACA?     Juan: Yes.     Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to   happen.     Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.     Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could   expunge from your record?     Juan: Yes.     Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't   want to be here anymore.&quot;     Anne: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated   accusation?     Juan: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?     Anne: Yes.     Juan: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.     Juan: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?     Anne: A bond?     Juan: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $10,000 bond. Then my dad came   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.     Juan: It was something that, like I said, I'm just glad it's over with but   it's an experience that I went through that sometimes I do hate myself for   putting myself in that situation because I could say, &quot;Well, maybe that   night I should've just stayed home. I shouldn't have gone out and I   should've just…&quot; Because at that time, I had a good job. My brother was   doing good, my family was doing good, my parents, they would go camping   every weekend or they would go fishing. They would go out.     Juan: I would provide help financially to my parents, so we were all doing   good. My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they first   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;     Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like   that. [Chuckles]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DACA">Anne: In the US, it didn't happen?

Did you guys speak English at home? Did you do American things,   activities? Do they work a lot? Tell me a little bit about family life.     Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for   his family.     Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family. In my   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn Spanish because it's   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.     Anne: Is she a citizen?     Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even   when it's Mother's Day over there … I think here it's May 10th but over   there, when is Mother's Day?     Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.     Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the   things that they did there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Thanksgiving">Anne: What was family life like with you and your brother and your mother   and father?

Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about   it.     Anne: That's too bad.     Juan: Yes [Chuckles].     Anne: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?

You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.   The Caucasian kids, they just didn't accept them—as in, for me, they did   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.

Anne: How about your brother?     Juan: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds.

Juan: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my English,   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able   to practice my English on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that   natives spoke it. But it took me 10 years to be able to—     Anne: But you were studying in an English school.     Juan: Yes.     Anne: You just felt your English skills were not great.     Juan: Yes, they weren't great.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Before the US, Border crossing">Anne: Did you cross the border with your family?     Juan: No, so my mom, she did have to walk when she crossed the border,   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the   mountains. My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time—I was eight, my   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like   any other family, we crossed the border.     Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones   that was able to make it back to their families.     Anne: It's a rugged trek.

He lives in the small</br>   villages where the houses are still made out of mud or their houses are</br>   barely standing—where the actual Mexican culture comes from. I guess we</br>   could say the indigenous people. That's the kind of place that my dad was</br>   coming from. He just wanted to provide us with a better future than he</br>   could provide us here in Mexico. He wanted us to go with him to the US and</br>   to be able to create a better future and better opportunity for us.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Were you living in that rural area before you left?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, before I left, I was living here in Mexico City, but not in the</br>   center. I was living in the outside of the center, where they were barely</br>   making houses. In a way it is, as well, rural parts because the conditions</br>   that we lived in weren't the best. We did have a roof over our heads and we</br>   did have food, but things could have been better when I was younger.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What did your dad do when he was working in Utah?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: From what my dad told me is, initially, he worked in a farm… I think</br>   it was strawberries, something to do with fruit. He would pick them out,</br>   but I think he was there for a year, a year and a half, he saw that he</br>   wasn't making much money so he started to get into the construction</br>   industry. That's where he was able to save up money so we can go with him,</br>   and after that, he's always been in the construction industry.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you cross the border with your family?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, so my mom, she did have to walk when she crossed the border,</br>   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the</br>   mountains. My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons</br>   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time—I was eight, my</br>   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like</br>   any other family, we crossed the border.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let</br>   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,</br>   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she</br>   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever</br>   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because</br>   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones</br>   that was able to make it back to their families.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's a rugged trek.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You immediately went to Provo, Utah. Did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, when I went to Utah, I went into 4th grade and then I didn't know</br>   any English. What did help was that the elementary that I went to, they had</br>   an ESL—I think it's English Second Language—available for people who didn't</br>   know any English, so that helped out a lot. My brother and I didn't know</br>   any English. My mom didn't know any English. My dad didn't know any</br>   English. It was just rough.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to learn?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my English,</br>   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I</br>   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able</br>   to practice my English on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that</br>   natives spoke it. But it took me 10 years to be able to—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were studying in an English school.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just felt your English skills were not great.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, they weren't great.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and</br>   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's</br>   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.</br>   The Caucasian kids, they just didn't accept them—as in, for me, they did</br>   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my</br>   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I did see that other kids who had the same situation as me, they</br>   didn't get accepted because—I don't know in that scenario what people</br>   looked at or why it was that I was lucky to get accepted when others</br>   didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,</br>   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to</br>   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles</br>   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds. We just wanted to learn</br>   from the different culture. We didn't really struggle that much to adapt,</br>   but then again, there's other people who do struggle.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I still remember in high school, my high school friends—I was in the</br>   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but</br>   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries</br>   from Latin America, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to</br>   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their</br>   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They would tell them, &quot;Go back to your country,” or “You can't even</br>   speak English right.&quot; Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't</br>   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that</br>   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really</br>   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my</br>   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people</br>   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Even though English was a struggle, I always tried my best, and</br>   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in</br>   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for</br>   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that</br>   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.</br>   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What position do you play?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got</br>   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I</br>   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here</br>   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just</br>   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and</br>   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were</br>   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,</br>   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's too bad.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I used to be really into the teams, but not anymore. Right now my</br>   focus is on other things and on the things that I used to think of. Right</br>   now, I'd rather focus on other things than keeping up with teams.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was family life like with you and your brother and your mother</br>   and father? Did you guys speak English at home? Did you do American things,</br>   activities? Do they work a lot? Tell me a little bit about family life.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's</br>   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the</br>   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in</br>   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or</br>   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes</br>   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for</br>   his family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who</br>   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family. In my</br>   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she</br>   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My</br>   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with</br>   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn Spanish because it's</br>   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the</br>   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even</br>   when it's Mother's Day over there … I think here it's May 10th but over</br>   there, when is Mother's Day?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day</br>   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they</br>   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but</br>   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter</br>   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?</br>   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't</br>   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture</br>   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the</br>   things that they did there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were enjoying school to some extent, and soccer. Did you get in</br>   trouble at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I was in high school, I did get in trouble because I did get in</br>   a couple of fights, but to the extent to say that I was a trouble maker or</br>   I wasn't disciplined, or to say that I didn't care about school, no. I</br>   consider myself not a good kid because I did get in trouble, but a kid who</br>   cared for his well being as in school-wise. I wanted to graduate, I wanted</br>   to continue to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Twenty four.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You wanted to go off to college, but that didn't happen or did it</br>   happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now I am in college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US, it didn't happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the</br>   first ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.</br>   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first</br>   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to</br>   work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A permit to work.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for</br>   one or two years, save up money, then go to college. That was my plan, but</br>   a situation happened—I think I was twenty. No, I was nineteen about to be</br>   twenty. I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all</br>   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and</br>   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you Juan?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and</br>   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a first-degree</br>   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a first-degree</br>   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my</br>   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge</br>   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found</br>   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They found out you weren't guilty.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that</br>   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This</br>   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're</br>   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a</br>   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?</br>   Yes, a plea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A plea.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my</br>   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent</br>   after five months [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a</br>   misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in</br>   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained</br>   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going</br>   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.</br>   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did</br>   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean</br>   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,</br>   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the</br>   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from</br>   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,</br>   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but</br>   immigration got me right there.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my</br>   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five</br>   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able</br>   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had</br>   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't</br>   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the</br>   US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is</br>   disqualifying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to</br>   happen.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could</br>   expunge from your record?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.</br>   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you</br>   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you</br>   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it</br>   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a</br>   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't</br>   want to be here anymore.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated</br>   accusation?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was</br>   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or</br>   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A bond?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $10,000 bond. Then my dad came</br>   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It was something that, like I said, I'm just glad it's over with but</br>   it's an experience that I went through that sometimes I do hate myself for</br>   putting myself in that situation because I could say, &quot;Well, maybe that</br>   night I should've just stayed home. I shouldn't have gone out and I</br>   should've just…&quot; Because at that time, I had a good job. My brother was</br>   doing good, my family was doing good, my parents, they would go camping</br>   every weekend or they would go fishing. They would go out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I would provide help financially to my parents, so we were all doing</br>   good. My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our</br>   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.</br>   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that</br>   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just</br>   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they first</br>   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He</br>   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,</br>   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;</br>   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what</br>   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind</br>   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't</br>   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like</br>   that. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long have you been back?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I've been here for three years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to Mexico and</br>   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I</br>   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just</br>   recently, two weeks ago, I quit my job so I can start to look into …</br>   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own</br>   company, and I don't know if you met Mauricio, he's one of the teachers</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his</br>   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an</br>   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, first of all, finish my career</br>   and then start off Airbnb. We're looking into that. We're looking for a</br>   potential house in Tepoztlán, which is an hour and a half from here, which</br>   is a really tourist part.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the</br>   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school</br>   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents</br>   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it</br>   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both</br>   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression</br>   and started hanging out with the wrong people.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.</br>   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,</br>   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to</br>   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've</br>   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for</br>   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with</br>   architecture.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of</br>   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build</br>   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,</br>   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really</br>   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses</br>   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I</br>   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because</br>   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every</br>   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they</br>   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.</br>   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to</br>   give back to my community, make it grow.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see</br>   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home</br>   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I</br>   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an</br>   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills</br>   that I'm developing right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That you're studying in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to … Right now, I'm</br>   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses</br>   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in Colombia and they have</br>   another method of, here in Mexico City, making houses out of plastic. I</br>   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes</br>   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that</br>   I want to give back to my community.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and</br>   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer</br>   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I</br>   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,</br>   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,</br>   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I</br>   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great</br>   dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US changed your life, changed you in any</br>   significant ways?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, because I lived in Provo, where all the Mormons are, and most of</br>   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.</br>   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way</br>   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from</br>   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a</br>   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different</br>   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way</br>   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to</br>   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be</br>   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,</br>   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.</br>   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US because I do have a</br>   different lookout in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the US I can go out</br>   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So a couple of things to reflect on. When we talked to young men</br>   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the US</br>   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal</br>   behavior. You did not.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you think the difference was?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know. I guess some people… I would say my dad, he provided me</br>   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since</br>   we were little, we were nine or ten, he would make us go to work with him,</br>   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even</br>   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you</br>   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang</br>   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. One of my</br>   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for two years or three</br>   years, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a</br>   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,</br>   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that</br>   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't</br>   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new</br>   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang</br>   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents</br>   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was</br>   abusive.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or</br>   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself</br>   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from</br>   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do</br>   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people</br>   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted</br>   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my</br>   mind.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in</br>   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the</br>   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in</br>   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for</br>   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing</br>   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out</br>   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go</br>   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,</br>   maybe look into those parents and help them.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't</br>   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in</br>   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been</br>   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years</br>   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my</br>   mom, who's a home … How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of</br>   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not</br>   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.</br>   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who</br>   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who</br>   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But</br>   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking</br>   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A</br>   program for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You go back to Mexico and you got to college. Was it hard making that</br>   transition?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I</br>   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that</br>   I went to the state’s—I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by</br>   the Provo School District. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came</br>   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come</br>   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what</br>   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They're like, &quot;It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't</br>   want to do it.&quot; I thought of my future and I was like, &quot;No, I've got to get</br>   this done,&quot; so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting</br>   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or</br>   how do you say it? Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Get it validated, and it did take six months but I got the answer</br>   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the</br>   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in Spanish, and my</br>   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't</br>   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the six</br>   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed one class.</br>   That was in my first semester and it was history.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, going back to the Spanish, it wasn't so good, that I</br>   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my Spanish is a lot better and,</br>   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In</br>   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and</br>   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,</br>   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the Airbnb. I'm</br>   looking to finishing my career strong and start my quest as an</br>   entrepreneur.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. It sounds like you've got great goals and that you'll</br>   be able to achieve them. One last question before we end. Do you think</br>   there's anything the Mexican government should do to help people coming</br>   back from the United States to integrate into society? Are there things</br>   that you see that are important to that?</br> </br> </br>   <span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Reflections, Mexico, Policy for reintegration, What Mexico has gained, Policy to help migrants, What the US has lost">Juan: Yes. There's a lot of things that the Mexican government can do.   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.     Juan: I know New Comienzos helps people who … Sometimes they do go to the   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else   to help me out.     Juan: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can   have this at home.     Juan: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a   lot of things that just— we all see positive things, but with all the   corruption here in Mexico, it's hard.     Juan: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change   anything. It's more of a Mexico thing. I guess we're not going so far; we   have Trump right now. I'm not sure how you guys feel about Trump. The way I  </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="The United States, US government and immigration, What the US has lost, Policy to help migrants, DACA,  reform">Anne: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?     Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,   maybe look into those parents and help them.

Juan: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A   program for them.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Favorite,  soccer, Cultural, Friends,  nature">Juan: Yes, because I lived in Provo, where all the Mormons are, and most of   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.     Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US because I do have a   different lookout in life.     Anne: What do you miss most about the US?     Juan: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the US I can go out   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.     Anne: It's beautiful.     Juan: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Mexico, Dreams,  reform, What Mexico has gained, Corruption">Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="What Mexico has gained, Favorite">Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills   that I'm developing right now.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Dreams, What Mexico has gained">Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression   and started hanging out with the wrong people.     Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with   architecture.     Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.     Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?     Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.  </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Return to Mexico, Challenges, Family Separation, Cultural differences">Anne: How long have you been back?     Juan: I've been here for three years.     Anne: Is it hard?     Juan: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to Mexico and   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I   told you, right now I'm in college.

We were looking to our   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they first   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;     Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like   that. [Chuckles]    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Arrests, Misdemeanors, Felonies, False Accusations, Framed by Police, Racial profiling, Reasons, Deportation, Court Proceedings, Judge, Lawyer, Case, Trial">I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you Juan?&quot;     Juan: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a first-degree   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a first-degree   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.     Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—     Anne: They found out you weren't guilty.     Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?   Yes, a plea.     Anne: A plea.     Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent   after five months [Chuckles].     Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a   misdemeanor?     Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A   misdemeanor.     Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but   immigration got me right there.     Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the   US.     Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is   disqualifying for DACA?     Juan: Yes.     Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to   happen.     Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.     Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could   expunge from your record?     Juan: Yes.     Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't   want to be here anymore.&quot;     Anne: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated   accusation?     Juan: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?     Anne: Yes.     Juan: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.     Juan: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?     Anne: A bond?     Juan: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $10,000 bond. Then my dad came   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="DACA, Eligibility, Acceptance, Advantages, Dreams, College, Higher Education, Dreaming about, Paying For">Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the   first ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—     Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?     Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to   work.     Anne: A permit to work.     Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for   one or two years, save up money, then go to college.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family,  mom, Parents/step-parents, Translating for, Learning English, Homelife, Mexican traditions,  Holidays,  Spanish language">In my   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn Spanish because it's   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.     Anne: Is she a citizen?     Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even   when it's Mother's Day over there … I think here it's May 10th but over   there, when is Mother's Day?     Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.     Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the   things that they did there.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Family, Parents/step-parents,  dad,  father,  careers,  construction, Values">Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for   his family.     Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family.</span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, High school, Working hard, getting good grades, Working hard, getting good grades, Extracurricular activities, Sports,  soccer, Friends">Anne: Did you do well in school?     Juan: Yes. Even though English was a struggle, I always tried my best, and   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.     Anne: What position do you play?     Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about   it.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="School, High school,  soccer, Discrimination, Bullying, Racism">Juan: I still remember in high school, my high school friends—I was in the   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries   from Latin America, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.     Juan: They would tell them, &quot;Go back to your country,” or “You can't even   speak English right.&quot; Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.    </span><span style="background: #ddd" class="entity" value="Time in the US, School, Elementary, Learning English/ ESL, States, Oklahoma">Anne: You immediately went to Provo, Utah. Did you know any English?     Juan: No, when I went to Utah, I went into 4th grade and then I didn't know   any English. What did help was that the elementary that I went to, they had   an ESL—I think it's English Second Language—available for people who didn't   know any English, so that helped out a lot.

My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time—I was eight, my   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like   any other family, we crossed the border.     Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones   that was able to make it back to their families.    </span> Anne: It's a rugged trek.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it is.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You immediately went to Provo, Utah. Did you know any English?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No, when I went to Utah, I went into 4th grade and then I didn't know</br>   any English.

My brother and I didn't know</br>   any English. My mom didn't know any English. My dad didn't know any</br>   English. It was just rough.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long did it take to learn?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my English,</br>   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I</br>   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able</br>   to practice my English on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that</br>   natives spoke it. But it took me 10 years to be able to—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: But you were studying in an English school.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You just felt your English skills were not great.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, they weren't great.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you make friends in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and</br>   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's</br>   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.</br>   The Caucasian kids, they just didn't accept them—as in, for me, they did</br>   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my</br>   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I did see that other kids who had the same situation as me, they</br>   didn't get accepted because—I don't know in that scenario what people</br>   looked at or why it was that I was lucky to get accepted when others</br>   didn't.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about your brother?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,</br>   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to</br>   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles</br>   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds. We just wanted to learn</br>   from the different culture. We didn't really struggle that much to adapt,</br>   but then again, there's other people who do struggle.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I still remember in high school, my high school friends—I was in the</br>   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but</br>   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries</br>   from Latin America, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to</br>   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their</br>   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They would tell them, &quot;Go back to your country,” or “You can't even</br>   speak English right.&quot; Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't</br>   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that</br>   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really</br>   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my</br>   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people</br>   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did you do well in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Even though English was a struggle, I always tried my best, and</br>   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in</br>   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for</br>   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that</br>   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.</br>   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What position do you play?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got</br>   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I</br>   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here</br>   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just</br>   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and</br>   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were</br>   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,</br>   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about</br>   it.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's too bad.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I used to be really into the teams, but not anymore. Right now my</br>   focus is on other things and on the things that I used to think of. Right</br>   now, I'd rather focus on other things than keeping up with teams.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What was family life like with you and your brother and your mother</br>   and father? Did you guys speak English at home? Did you do American things,</br>   activities? Do they work a lot? Tell me a little bit about family life.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's</br>   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the</br>   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in</br>   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or</br>   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes</br>   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for</br>   his family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who</br>   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family. In my</br>   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she</br>   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My</br>   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with</br>   her it's different. We tell her, &quot;You have to learn Spanish because it's</br>   going to help you,&quot; but she doesn't want to learn.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is she a citizen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the</br>   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even</br>   when it's Mother's Day over there … I think here it's May 10th but over</br>   there, when is Mother's Day?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day</br>   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they</br>   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but</br>   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter</br>   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?</br>   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't</br>   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture</br>   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the</br>   things that they did there.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You were enjoying school to some extent, and soccer. Did you get in</br>   trouble at all?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I was in high school, I did get in trouble because I did get in</br>   a couple of fights, but to the extent to say that I was a trouble maker or</br>   I wasn't disciplined, or to say that I didn't care about school, no. I</br>   consider myself not a good kid because I did get in trouble, but a kid who</br>   cared for his well being as in school-wise. I wanted to graduate, I wanted</br>   to continue to college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How old are you now?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Twenty four.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You wanted to go off to college, but that didn't happen or did it</br>   happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now I am in college.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's good.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: In the US, it didn't happen?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the</br>   first ones who had received it—because that's when it had barely come out.</br>   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first</br>   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to</br>   work.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A permit to work.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for</br>   one or two years, save up money, then go to college. That was my plan, but</br>   a situation happened—I think I was twenty. No, I was nineteen about to be</br>   twenty. I got accused of something, which was a really big deal, and it all</br>   went downhill from there. I got accused and then I was working one day and</br>   the cops came looking for me and they were like, &quot;Are you Juan?&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I'm like, &quot;Yes,&quot; so they're like, &quot;You're being accused of this and</br>   that,&quot; and then I got sent to jail. I was being accused of a first-degree</br>   felony, so they were like, &quot;If you're found guilty of a first-degree</br>   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison.&quot; Right there, my</br>   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge</br>   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found</br>   out that I wasn't guilty, so this is something really strange because—</br> </br> </br>   Anne: They found out you weren't guilty.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that</br>   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This</br>   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're</br>   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a</br>   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?</br>   Yes, a plea.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A plea.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my</br>   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent</br>   after five months [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a</br>   misdemeanor?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in</br>   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained</br>   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going</br>   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.</br>   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did</br>   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A</br>   misdemeanor.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean</br>   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,</br>   &quot;Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the</br>   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from</br>   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,</br>   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but</br>   immigration got me right there.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my</br>   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five</br>   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able</br>   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had</br>   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't</br>   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the</br>   US.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is</br>   disqualifying for DACA?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to</br>   happen.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could</br>   expunge from your record?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.</br>   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you</br>   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you</br>   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it</br>   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a</br>   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, &quot;I don't</br>   want to be here anymore.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You said that you were accused of a felony. Was it a fabricated</br>   accusation?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, fabricated accusation—do you mean was it made up?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was made up. It was a made-up accusation.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The funny part is that once I was out of jail because … When I was</br>   with immigration, the judge found me … I wasn't a danger to society or</br>   anything like that. He let me off with a…How do you call it?</br> </br> </br>   Anne: A bond?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: With a bond, yes. Actually, it was a $10,000 bond. Then my dad came</br>   up with the money fast so that he could get me out of jail.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: It was something that, like I said, I'm just glad it's over with but</br>   it's an experience that I went through that sometimes I do hate myself for</br>   putting myself in that situation because I could say, &quot;Well, maybe that</br>   night I should've just stayed home. I shouldn't have gone out and I</br>   should've just…&quot; Because at that time, I had a good job. My brother was</br>   doing good, my family was doing good, my parents, they would go camping</br>   every weekend or they would go fishing. They would go out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I would provide help financially to my parents, so we were all doing</br>   good. My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our</br>   future—everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.</br>   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I’m like, because of the situation that</br>   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just</br>   glad that they … Because one thing that I remember is that when they first</br>   took me in jail, they're like, &quot;You have one call.&quot;</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, &quot;Dad, I'm in jail.&quot; He</br>   was like, &quot;Why?&quot; I'm like, &quot;They're accusing me of this.&quot; And he just said,</br>   &quot;Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.&quot;</br>   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what</br>   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind</br>   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't</br>   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like</br>   that. [Chuckles]</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How long have you been back?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I've been here for three years.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Is it hard?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: At the beginning it was hard because … Getting adapted to Mexico and</br>   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined—like I</br>   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just</br>   recently, two weeks ago, I quit my job so I can start to look into …</br>   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own</br>   company, and I don't know if you met Mauricio, he's one of the teachers</br>   here.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Yes.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his</br>   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an</br>   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, first of all, finish my career</br>   and then start off Airbnb. We're looking into that. We're looking for a</br>   potential house in Tepoztlán, which is an hour and a half from here, which</br>   is a really tourist part.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the</br>   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school</br>   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back … So my parents</br>   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it</br>   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both</br>   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression</br>   and started hanging out with the wrong people.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.</br>   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,</br>   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to</br>   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, &quot;We're proud of you and we've</br>   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for</br>   nothing.&quot; I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with</br>   architecture.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of</br>   plastic—not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build</br>   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,</br>   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really</br>   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses</br>   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are … How do I</br>   say it? Houses that are … I had the word.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because</br>   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every</br>   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they</br>   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.</br>   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to</br>   give back to my community, make it grow.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see</br>   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home</br>   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I</br>   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an</br>   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills</br>   that I'm developing right now.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That you're studying in school?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to … Right now, I'm</br>   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses</br>   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in Colombia and they have</br>   another method of, here in Mexico City, making houses out of plastic. I</br>   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes</br>   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that</br>   I want to give back to my community.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and</br>   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer</br>   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I</br>   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,</br>   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,</br>   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I</br>   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great</br>   dreams.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Do you think being in the US changed your life, changed you in any</br>   significant ways?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, because I lived in Provo, where all the Mormons are, and most of</br>   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.</br>   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way</br>   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from</br>   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a</br>   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different</br>   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way</br>   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to</br>   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be</br>   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,</br>   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.</br>   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US because I do have a</br>   different lookout in life.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you miss most about the US?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the US I can go out</br>   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: It's beautiful.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: So a couple of things to reflect on. When we talked to young men</br>   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the US</br>   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal</br>   behavior. You did not.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: No.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: What do you think the difference was?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know. I guess some people… I would say my dad, he provided me</br>   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since</br>   we were little, we were nine or ten, he would make us go to work with him,</br>   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even</br>   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you</br>   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for</br>   you.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang</br>   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. One of my</br>   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for two years or three</br>   years, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a</br>   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,</br>   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that</br>   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't</br>   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new</br>   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang</br>   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents</br>   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was</br>   abusive.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or</br>   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself</br>   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from</br>   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do</br>   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people</br>   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted</br>   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my</br>   mind.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in</br>   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the</br>   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in</br>   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for</br>   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing</br>   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out</br>   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go</br>   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,</br>   maybe look into those parents and help them.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't</br>   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in</br>   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been</br>   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years</br>   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my</br>   mom, who's a home … How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of</br>   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not</br>   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.</br>   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who</br>   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who</br>   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But</br>   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking</br>   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A</br>   program for them.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: You go back to Mexico and you got to college. Was it hard making that</br>   transition?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I</br>   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that</br>   I went to the state’s—I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by</br>   the Provo School District. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came</br>   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come</br>   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what</br>   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: They're like, &quot;It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't</br>   want to do it.&quot; I thought of my future and I was like, &quot;No, I've got to get</br>   this done,&quot; so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting</br>   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or</br>   how do you say it? Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Validated.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Get it validated, and it did take six months but I got the answer</br>   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the</br>   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in Spanish, and my</br>   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't</br>   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the six</br>   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed one class.</br>   That was in my first semester and it was history.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Because, again, going back to the Spanish, it wasn't so good, that I</br>   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my Spanish is a lot better and,</br>   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In</br>   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and</br>   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,</br>   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the Airbnb. I'm</br>   looking to finishing my career strong and start my quest as an</br>   entrepreneur.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. It sounds like you've got great goals and that you'll</br>   be able to achieve them. One last question before we end. Do you think</br>   there's anything the Mexican government should do to help people coming</br>   back from the United States to integrate into society? Are there things</br>   that you see that are important to that?</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yes. There's a lot of things that the Mexican government can do.</br>   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to</br>   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a</br>   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,</br>   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't</br>   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I know New Comienzos helps people who … Sometimes they do go to the</br>   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other</br>   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out</br>   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had</br>   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like</br>   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else</br>   to help me out.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new</br>   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with</br>   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government</br>   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program</br>   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't</br>   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can</br>   have this at home.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way</br>   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view</br>   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things</br>   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of</br>   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a</br>   lot of things that just— we all see positive things, but with all the</br>   corruption here in Mexico, it's hard.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or</br>   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different</br>   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change</br>   anything. It's more of a Mexico thing. I guess we're not going so far; we</br>   have Trump right now. I'm not sure how you guys feel about Trump. The way I</br>   see, we provide power to the wrong people all the time.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: As a community, we always do wrong. When I was in the US, we had</br>   Bernie. I love Bernie, I wish he would have been president, but they chose</br>   Hillary instead, and Hillary lost against Trump. Then I come to Mexico, and</br>   we had all hopes that this new government was going to do positive things.</br>   He is making a change, but it's going downhill right now. My long-term goal</br>   is to be able to change the way people view things, because Mexicans can be</br>   selfish, they can be ignorant.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: That's because that's how they were taught since they were little.</br>   What I want to do is change Mexico and take out all the potential that we</br>   have, because we have so much potential, we just don't do it, so does the</br>   US. The US has so much potential, one of the top ones with the potential,</br>   but because of right now with the leaders that we have, we're not able to</br>   provide it. Then again, I guess that's overall as a society. We want to</br>   change this, let's change this or change that, but we can't, because the</br>   person who is ruling is not going to … They have other things in priority.</br> </br> </br>   Anne: Maybe you'll be a president.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: I want to be president, but I want to make a change [Chuckles].</br> </br> </br>   Anne: That's great. Well, thank you very much.</br> </br> </br>   Juan: Yeah, no problem.</br> </div></figure></body></html><\p></p>
