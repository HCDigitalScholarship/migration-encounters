His ID is Manny08. The first thing I want to say is thank you so much for coming out here and talking to us. I understand that sometimes talking about this experience and telling these stories can bring about emotions that you don&#39;t necessarily want to feel and it can be something different, but I think it&#39;s good to note that your story is very important and is important for people to hear and for people to understand the realities of migration and the human side of it. That&#39;s what we&#39;re trying to do with this project. Thank you very much for agreeing to be a part of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question is just, why did your family leave Mexico, or why did you decide to leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first thing was because we so poor. My dad, he leave us, too, when I was five years. That&#39;s why live in Mexico with that situation, without a father, I think it was very hard. That&#39;s why when I was 14 years old, I decide to move upstate for help my family. 1997 actually is when I cross the border because economy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I remember.

It was for go get the buns.

Being an owner was what I liked. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk me through the deportation. You went to get the buns, you got pulled over, traffic violation. Did they detain you? What happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That day, it was 8:00 in the morning. I don&#39;t really remember what day it is. That was Friday, around 8:00. It&#39;s a busy day, the busy time. I just run two blocks. Actually, the police actually were the state police, the patrol police. They detain me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He ask me for my papers and everything. I told, &quot;You know what? My paper is on its way. This is my driver&#39;s license.&quot; My Mexican driver license. I show the paper that I&#39;m waiting for my DACA document papers, and I&#39;m the owner from that pizza shop behind. &quot;You go give me a chance that I got to come back to my place because I leave my own employees.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t care, say, &quot;You know what?

I have to come back to my shop.&quot; They don&#39;t care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of the ICE told me, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Come to us. You can use me to sign something and you just call to your family. He can come to pick you up.&quot; &quot;Are you sure?&quot; &quot;Yeah. Don&#39;t worry about it. Can you just come to us? Don&#39;t worry about it. We need to tell you something. We need to make sure you were in DACA,&quot; and all that shit. Oh, okay. I was like, that was not true.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just put in the jail and he wants to deport me. He will, actually. I pay a lawyer $4,000. The court is every three months. I waited the first three months and the lawyer, he just don&#39;t go to the first court. The next day, he show up and he told me, &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. Let&#39;s wait another three months for the paper. I want to working with the paper.&quot; He show up the papers and everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second, he&#39;s like, &quot;No. We want to wait another three months.&quot; Then three months later, and suddenly nine months, he don&#39;t show up. He don&#39;t show up, and I worry about my stuff and my family. I&#39;m wasting time. I say, &quot;You know what? I got desperate, and I called the judge and I sent him a letter. I want to turn to Mexico. I don&#39;t care.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In that time, I say, &quot;You know what? I don&#39;t care. I just have to cross the border again and I don&#39;t care.&quot; After that I saw the situation and everything in both sides, I want to stay a little bit here. I want to see if I ... and you know how they say the American dream. You can do that here in Mexico. It&#39;s very difficult, but we&#39;ll see. We&#39;ll see.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I understand that you had a family in the States?

He born in Texas.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States, you just worked. Were you ever exposed to any gang violence or any of that sort of thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Nothing like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing like that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything, you just work, straight work. Every day.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the name of your pizza shop?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pasaro&#39;s Pizza.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know if it&#39;s still open?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Everything is gone. Actually, my girlfriend, she from Chile, actually she sell the place. We broke up. I lost her, too. She don&#39;t send me all the money. She send me whatever money. That&#39;s it. Everything is gone. I&#39;m got to start over again. It is gone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years. Almost two years.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How has it been?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year was very bad. I was depressed. I say, &ldquo;Damn. All my sacrifice, all my everything, I sacrifice everything for nothing, and it&#39;s not good.&rdquo; You turn to your country without nothing, with nothing, with zero.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico, they don&#39;t give you any opportunities because you age, because you don&#39;t have any experience, because you got to come validate your studies and then ... It&#39;s very bad. Mexico is very&hellip; they don&#39;t give you many opportunities.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you decide to stay and not go back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because the first thing, I don&#39;t have money to come back. If you have the money, well, I come back. I&#39;m going to try to see if I can do something here, but I don&#39;t see anything. I don&#39;t see anything good. I don&#39;t have money. I don&#39;t have nothing. It&#39;s very bad. Very, very bad. Yep. This what I think. For making another play, for open a place, I need money. For do something, I need the money. People here, they don&#39;t want us. That&#39;s what I think. They don&#39;t want us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ll ask for a lot of place and they don&#39;t want me because, I don&#39;t know, the way I look or because I don&#39;t have an experience, because I don&#39;t live in Mexico for a long time. I&#39;ll ask for an opportunity, they may say, &quot;I&#39;ll call you.&quot; Whatever. They never call me back. That&#39;s very bad situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back a little bit because I want to ask you a question, but I forgot. You went to the United States on your own. What was it like to leave your family like that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why I just leave my family like that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like? What did you feel?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I feel so bad. I leave my brothers, my mom. At that age, 14 years, you imagine? I miss my mom, I miss my brothers. I miss very much. I miss my family. It&#39;s the one problem because right now when I turn to them, I don&#39;t even know them. We just talk, but not like brothers. They just like, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; Yeah, you&#39;re my brother, but not the same thing like when you grow with them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not what it used to be?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. When the first few months, they just looking at me like, who are you? You are my brother? They looking like, and everybody here. It&#39;s one of the problems when you&#39;re leaving family for a long time. Very bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said in your survey that discrimination was one of the challenges that you face. Can you elaborate a little bit more on that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, since we&#39;re on the topic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel more discrimination here in my country because, like I said, probably the way I look, the way I talk, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know why they do that. In United States, they don&#39;t care. They like Mexicans because they like to work, they like how we work. They don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t care how you look. They give you a chance, an opportunity to work, or work for them. Here in Mexico, no. You saw here, the division between the rich and poor. You saw that? Here is no good. This is no good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you received any help since you&#39;ve been back from the government or a non-government organization?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They give me this employment, unemployment?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Unemployment, yeah, for the immigrants on return. They give me that help. They help me a little bit. It&#39;s not that much, but at least something. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I feel like ... When you turn to here, I feel more American. Right now, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know. I don&#39;t even know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like you&#39;re in a foreign country sometimes?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Right now, I&#39;m confused. I&#39;m confused. I like my country, but I don&#39;t want to be here. I like to be in United States, but probably is impossible to come back right now, but I waste. I want to live over there. Sometimes I think, why I don&#39;t born over there? Why I don&#39;t born over there? Why I had to pass all these hard situations because I&#39;m Mexican? It&#39;s very bad. It&#39;s very bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about your mom? What was it like to be reunited with her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like to see your mom again after all those years?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel good, but like I say, after I saw her, everything nice, but they don&#39;t know me. They don&#39;t know me. They don&#39;t know how to think, because we are different already. We&#39;re like a friend. No, not even friends. It&#39;s a difficult relation with my mom, with my brother. It&#39;s difficult because they don&#39;t know how I think. I don&#39;t know how they think. They will be different. We grow up in different. It&#39;s part of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Isn&rsquo;t that a mess?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you feel a sense of culture shock when you came back to Mexico? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. They just drop me right there, right in the border. I just feel the difference, I feel &ldquo;what the...&rdquo; I say, &ldquo;what is happening?: You see all the different and you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, my God, I&#39;m in Mexico already.&quot; Then you saw all different and you start feel like, oh, my God, what I want to do, what I want to do, what I want to do? It&#39;s not the same, it&#39;s not the same. It&#39;s very hard for to assimilate, you&#39;ve been in Mexico again. It&#39;s very hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably you saw with all the other who come as well, I think they feel the same thing, shocked like, &quot;Oh, we are in Mexico already? Oh my God. And now what&rsquo;s going to happen? What we want to do?&rdquo; Okay, let&#39;s go. Yes, like that. Why couldn&rsquo;t I have been Puerto Rican? I miss it. In ____ there&rsquo;s a lot of Puerto Ricans, on every corner they have their food. It&#39;s the good stuff. Good stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At least your county isn&rsquo;t a colony, that&rsquo;s what is hard. Yes, but being able to have an American passport is a privilege. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I say, I don&#39;t know what I do bad. But I don&rsquo;t know. Only God knows. Only God knows why he do all this to me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you currently unemployed?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I am a taxi driver. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How is that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t like it. I never do that. I just started and it&#39;s very bad. You see all the traffic stuff and all the thing and it&#39;s like New York. The same like New York, or probably, I don&#39;t know, is this the same or worse in New York, but it&#39;s very bad. I don&#39;t like it, I don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t like it. I don&#39;t like. That&#39;s the only way I make money because it&rsquo;s hard. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Please, I don&#39;t know. I live by day over there. Yeah, I have a lot of things on my mind for be better, for be done better, but I was like, I living day by day. It was stress. My life was stress at that time because I had a pizza shop. I having everything. I have everything. I think I had everything, that everything was ready. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what would you like to do? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. I don&rsquo;t have that. I want to do a lot of things, but the thing, I don&#39;t have money for do anything. I want to open a business again, I want to open a pizza shop again. I don&#39;t have money for open my shop. That&#39;s what I know to do. That&#39;s what I know, the restaurants. This is what I do. Here in Mexico, if you want to apply to some restaurant, Italian restaurant or whatever restaurant, they want high school and how do you say&hellip;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The documents?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The documents with you or study for making chef. If he&#39;s not, no. Dishwashers, do that work, dish-wash. It is very bad. In the United States no, upstate, if you know how to work, they give you job. Go ahead. Work. But here no, it&#39;s so hard. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the whole idea of the American dream in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I heard the American dream, you can do it in Mexico, but that&#39;s too hard. That&#39;s too hard. I think it&#39;s too hard. You got to work like, I don&#39;t know, double or triple for do something good. Like I say, if you have money, so I can open a place, but I can&#39;t. I&#39;m stuck now. My mind is like, I want to do a lot of things, but I can&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think that the Mexican government can do to help returning migrants into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. I don&#39;t know. You know, what the government can do? The Mexican government is no good. Mexican government is so, oh, corrupt. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s all corrupt.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s all corrupt. If you don&#39;t have, how do you say a good friend and a company, here you call it a &ldquo;palanca&rdquo; a good friend. I don&#39;t know nobody. I don&#39;t know nobody. Here there is a VIP zone. If you don&#39;t have somebody you know, to help you get into the company then you are always going to work the worst jobs, and the minimum here is, I don&#39;t know, 300, 400 pesos a week, $40 a week? You imagine, $40 a week? It&#39;s no good. This is hard life. It&#39;s a difficult life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those are all the questions that I had, but I want to give you the space to see if you want to add anything, anything else that you feel like you want to say or you have to say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, nothing. If someone want to help me out there, go ahead, I&#39;m receive everything, but if it&#39;s not, it&#39;s okay. Thank you anyways.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for talking. Then that&#39;s it. You made it through.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Manny:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. </span></p><p class="c2 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c10 c3"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c6"><tbody><tr class="c7"><td class="c8" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c1"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
