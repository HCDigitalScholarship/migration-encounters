So just to start, Bobby will put some stuff too, you mentioned that you came to the US when you were a couple months old, you grew up pretty much as an American. Did you know or how old were you when you found out that you were undocumented? Or did you not know? Or how did that happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never knew until I grew up I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until like high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, yeah. High school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you did ESL classes. Can you tell me a bit about school? What your friends were like? What did you like to do when you were younger?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked to play baseball, I just liked PlayStation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. Like your normal kids stuff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like school? Or what was school like for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I liked it somewhat, sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my last year, I liked it the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your last year in high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I had my own car. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was better knowing that I wasn&#39;t going to go to school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Absolutely. Can you tell me a bit about what your friends were like? What you liked to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had few friends. They were all baseball kids [inaudible 00:01:41]. And later on, I met my [inaudible 00:01:46] friends.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you play baseball all the way through high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. My college has a pretty decent baseball team. It&#39;s fun watching that, but I have no idea about baseball. I play lacrosse now. I used to play soccer, but sports are really fun. So you have your friends from your sports team, and then your friends, are they from outside school? Or did your friends...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From school as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. From school as well. So you got your GED, you graduated high school. So your GED, how did you get that? Was that night class or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My GED?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was to get the job at </span><span class="c9">Pearl</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I needed my diploma, so I left regular school and went straight to GED. And I graduated at two months, three months, with my GED.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow. Nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a bit about what your job was like? Did you like it, or not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was simple. It wasn&#39;t really much of labor, just making calls and using the computer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Holding the line for the [inaudible 00:03:02].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. And you mentioned you have, was it a little sister?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was a US citizen? What&#39;s she like, what&#39;s your relationship with her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don&#39;t have that much of a close relationship with her. I really don&#39;t talk to her.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do you keep in touch with? Anyone back in the States right now, or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My mom and my older brother. That&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your mom like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, she&#39;s a typical Mexican mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What does that mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s always telling me to behave and all that, to get a job [laughs] and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like you listened to her when you were younger or not really? Why&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. She always told me to behave and I just did the opposite I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you did do some time in prison. Was that how you meant by misbehavior? How old were you when that happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first time I went to county was at the age of 18.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, because that&#39;s when you&#39;re just legally an adult?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like? Were you scared or were you...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I was more just worrying what my mom was going to say because she never thought </span><span class="c9">I&rsquo;d be like that way,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;because of my charges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mentioned that you were in county. Was this when you were affiliated with the gang, you mentioned that in the survey?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your mom know that you were, is that why she was surprised or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my mom never knew I was in a gang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. I mean, how were you able to keep that separate? I feel like that&#39;s kind of difficult, right? Or maybe I&#39;m wrong. You can tell me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not really because I was just behaving in the house. She would tell me, &quot;be like another person&quot; I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around my family, I&#39;ll try to avoid all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. One of the things that one of our professors is kind of researching and trying to figure out is this trend of young migrants, especially undocumented migrants, who maybe are under a different experience with the system, being targeted by the police and stuff, why they may end up joining or being affiliated with gangs. What factors kind of moved you towards being affiliated with gangs? If you could reflect on that, it&#39;s kind of a big question.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really can&#39;t explain it. You sometimes feel safer I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because people fear you, and some people take that as an advantage. So, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, we&#39;ve talked to other people as well who have said a lot of times &quot;once I was affiliated with a group like a gang, I was going to be treated that way.&quot; So it&#39;s better to be a part of it and have them have your backs so that you can be safe in that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel protected.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In some ways, as well, you feel threatened of your life because of the rival gangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, so it&#39;s kind of like...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s you know, like good and bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think one way that someone was describing also is, &quot;you kind of need to be a part of it to be safe, and then that also almost puts you in more danger also.&quot; Because you&#39;re being targeted, but then you&#39;re also being protected. And then that kind of is magnified in the prison system too. One person described it as the inmates actually run the prisons.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like that&#39;s the case as well?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. In my time in prison, that&#39;s how I felt it was.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Could you tell me a bit about like what led to your deportation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The gang getting in trouble with the law, getting charges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What did the lawyers advise you or lawyer advise you to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have actually been too trusting. They told me at first to leave the town. Said &quot;get new friends&quot;. Since I didn&#39;t behave, they just told me to do my time and get deported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of take the deal?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you, looking back, regret any decisions you made or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I can&#39;t say regret, but yeah I&#39;ve made my bad choices in life. I feel like everything happens for a reason based on whether it&#39;s going to make you stronger or weaker. That&#39;s all I see. I don&#39;t really depend on anyone right now, because of my period of time. I&#39;ve been through a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you feel like it&#39;s made you sort of more independent?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Kind of like getting into that realm a bit. Could you tell me a bit about like actually being deported back to Mexico? You pretty much grew up in the US, right? For a while to even know that you weren&#39;t allowed to talk to [inaudible 00:08:55] or anything like that, while you&#39;re not a US citizen? So was it like you were in a completely new country? What was the experience coming to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really? it just felt like home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? Are you going to tell me about that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About being in the streets. In the streets, like nothing. Over there, there are cops all over you, harassing you. Right here, sometimes but not really.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you came into Mexico, were you able to connect with people who&#39;d had a similar experience in the States or was it mostly people who grew up in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people came from Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you had Spanish from your childhood when you were able to integrate pretty well. You said you had a hard time landing, a job. Why do you think that was?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably because of my tattoo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of like the stereotypes that go along with it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They judge you, right away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They think that they&#39;re going to get robbed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think that&#39;s a really common experience that we&#39;ve heard too, which is that a lot of people who want to have a second chance or try again and get a job don&#39;t really have the opportunity because of the...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the other people that have messed it up for the rest, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. You mentioned that you felt more targeted or vulnerable as a </span><span class="c9">returning migrant, with your</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;English. Because sometimes, maybe the way you present yourself. Do you have maybe a first memory or experience of that kind of experience in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People can notice right away, because of my accent, how I dress, my style I have is different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c9">Like w</span><span class="c1">hat I&#39;m used to but, I&#39;m with you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s different to them, and to us it&#39;s worth nothing. They&#39;re different to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And you mentioned your kid in the States, is that a son and how old?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years old. And are you still in touch with the mother or no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really, more in touch with my son.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Just on the phone? FaceTime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FaceTime.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;FaceTime. What do you talk about? What do you like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If he wants to come over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live or to visit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want him to come and go and visit you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don&#39;t really got a stable spot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you want to wait until you have some things set up for him to come.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And since I have a baby on the way too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a name for her yet?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to let her Mom choose.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. So are you in contact with the mom here then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico with the baby?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Are you dating?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, when she gets to her home town.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Is that where she&#39;s having the baby?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. I see so you want to have your life set up a bit before your son comes to visit as well. If you were still in the US, what do you think you would be doing? Or what would you hope to be doing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably [inaudible 00:12:34], like you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And now that you&#39;re in Mexico, do you have any hopes of what you want to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I take it as a second chance, so I&#39;m trying to get a job and do good, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Before we wrap up, I just have some quick reflection question that my professor is like, make sure you a</span><span class="c9">sk them</span><span class="c1">&hellip; Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American? Like the United States American.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is that just because you were born here or do you just feel more comfortable?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel more comfortable.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Alright cool. Well, is there anything you&#39;d like to add before we wrap up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Jose:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect.
