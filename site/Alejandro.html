I&#39;m here with Alejandro. And we&#39;re doing the interview. So Alejandro, what was the reason why your family decided to go to the United States?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why my family decided to go to the United States was because, I mean, financial help. We just wanted a better life. Get out</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;get out of poverty. That&#39;s the only reason why.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when your [inaudible 00:00:36] migrated?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;around&hellip; I was</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;a baby. I was around two years old. Maybe going to two.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the first memory that you have in the United States?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First memories, just the leaves. They were colored leaves. The first thing I remember was going to the park. And then just seeing those colorful leaves. Snow. That was it</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Do you remember </span><span class="c2 c0">your schooling?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember my schooling. I remember going to kindergarten, first grade,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;elementary school</span><span class="c0 c3">. I remember going to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;middle school</span><span class="c2 c0">. I used to play sports. I was always soccer player. I remember school.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, what did you think you wanted to do in the future?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go to college, work, have a car, have my own place, you know? Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what changed all that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What changed all that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W</span><span class="c0">hat changed all that? </span><span class="c0 c3">Maybe the places that we were moving into</span><span class="c0">. N</span><span class="c2 c0">ew friends, I don&#39;t know, a lot of things change, family issues.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you were living </span><span class="c0">throughout</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">different parts of the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Chicago area, right?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s got a reputation for like really tough neighborhoods. Is that the kind of where you grew?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. All I grew up just going project to project. I grew up in different projects all the time, going to different neighborhoods. Sometimes I would go to a neighborhood where I wouldn&#39;t belong. There would be rival gang bangers, and they would just be difficult. Like actually being there, and every time I would run into trouble, I would always get my mom kicked out of one place. And it was just like I said, family issues. Just different friends, different lifestyle. You start going up, you start seeing different things. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As you were going through that, what did you think? What was it like you were around your friend group, was it that you kind of felt like you had to survive or </span><span class="c0">what was going through your mind?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s just that I grew up with certain people. So, with the same friends I grew up with, it was like, I couldn&#39;t leave them. And like I said, I could probably start a new friends every time I moved to a different neighborhood, but it was just like, I don&#39;t know, the loyalty plus it&#39;s just like the things that you been with them. You can&#39;t leave them. So you basically got that guilt in the back of your head like, I can&#39;t leave them. Like they&#39;d been there with me when no one else was, you know? Or when I needed them and stuff like that, they were actually there. And it was just like, yeah, you can&#39;t leave them hanging there. It wasn&#39;t being afraid, but it was something that you were supposed to do, you know.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I suppose, did you join gangs In the US?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I joined the gang.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Just, it was one</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just one gang.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And </span><span class="c0">w</span><span class="c0 c3">hat did you think</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;what did that mean for you when you were joining?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was just respect and money at the time. I mean, I just joined it for the money too. Like you&#39;re growing up </span><span class="c0">all</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;you want to do is have money and then you just see that they get it so quick and easy. You just want to go ahead and get, be like them. And it&#39;s just like I told you </span><span class="c0">like </span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;you grew up with them. So it was like, even if you didn&#39;t want </span><span class="c0">to, you&#39;re</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;from that neighborhood. So you&#39;re from the hood at the end of the day. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you thin</span><span class="c0">k, w</span><span class="c2 c0">ere you the only undocumented person joining gangs?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. There was probably a couple more people, but I mean, out of all my friends, it&#39;s probably like two or three that are out here and everybody still out there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it wasn&#39;t like just because you were undocumented, you&#39;re joining?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was just friends I grew up with growing up in the same neighborhood go and joining the neighborhood gang.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it&#39;s friends so you couldn&#39;t just say no?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up in Pomona which is like</span><span class="c0">&hellip; </span><span class="c2 c0">.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s called Pomona.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pomona. Texas? Pomona, California?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s also a tough neighborhood. So, I have a lot of friends who&#39;ve been shot </span><span class="c0">at</span><span class="c2 c0">, almost killed and I was lucky enough to keep my head down and get out. Did you have any friends like that? Or did you ever experience any violence like that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Violence in the US? Yeah. That was an everyday thing. Yeah. I experienced a lot of violence, a lot of chase. They chase me, I chased them. You seen a couple of shootouts here and there. Yeah. That was everyday thing, man. Like, you&#39;re from that block, you can&#39;t leave that block, man. Just stay in your block because we ain&#39;t got nothing else to do </span><span class="c0">over there</span><span class="c0 c3">. You&#39;re just going to end up getting shot or getting chased or getting </span><span class="c0">bricked</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;at, getting thrown a bottle at your head. That was everyday thing out there. Chicago was murder capital.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what&#39;s one of your favorite memories of the US?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Going to the beach every summer, like going and spending time with my family, going out. We actually have family things. We actually went to Wisconsin Dells, we actually went out to beaches, had cookouts. I miss my family, man. They&#39;re all at the toast. They&#39;re over there. My sisters, my brothers, like I said, my mom is out there. I mean, they&#39;re all out there and I&#39;m out here. </span><span class="c0">And yeah</span><span class="c2 c0">, just having those family experiences, just chilling with them, spending time with them.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What ended up happening that led to the start </span><span class="c0">of </span><span class="c2 c0">your deportation back to the US?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I caught a case. That&#39;s what led me to get my deportation out here. I caught a felony case. But I was actually a juvenile still. I was 17. I had parole in </span><span class="c0">__ County</span><span class="c0 c3">. I lived in the Aurora area and then I have parole and I went in </span><span class="c0">___County </span><span class="c0 c3">when I was living in the </span><span class="c0">West Chicago</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;area. And instead of them calling my parole officer, how they were supposed to when I caught my case, they just seen that it was an aggravated battery. I&#39;m sorry, with bodily harm. Like I told you earlier, the Narcos actually, they seen us growing up. So I guess they really had something towards me that they always see me running into trouble, I guess.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when I actually caught this case, they even told me like, &quot;We&#39;re so happy that you caught this case cause </span><span class="c0">now</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;we</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;going to be able to deport you.&quot; Literally that&#39;s like the exact words. And I was just like, I ain&#39;t think nothing of it, because to be honest with you, I never thought I was going to get deported. Never in my life, me as a child growing up thinking, </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;</span><span class="c0 c3">Oh, one day you&#39;re going to get deported.</span><span class="c0">&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;No, I was like, &quot;What&#39;s deported? What is that?&quot; But like I said, I grew up with a mentality that I thought I was never going to be out here in Mexico. I knew I was Mexican. I came from a Mexican family. But, yeah. I never thought I was going to end up over here and actually going through things that I actually went through out here. Never in my life that I think I was going to be out here, man.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you caught that case, did you think you were still involved because you thought you were never going to get deported</span><span class="c0">, like it would have been</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;different if you knew you might be deported?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">New Speaker:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Yeah,</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;If I knew I was going to get deported day, I will probably </span><span class="c0">calmed my</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;butt down, I would have probably sat down. But, yeah, if I knew I was going to get deported, but I thought I still had a couple of years. Like I said, I was still a juvenile. Like I was actually just like, &quot;What? They can&#39;t do nothing to me yet.&quot; Like I said, I never thought I was gonna &nbsp;be out here, man. I thought I was still going to have... Even if I caught a case, I still thought I was going to have a chance like, Oh, I&#39;m going to have a daughter spen</span><span class="c0">d</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;all my life here. They can&#39;t deport me, they can&#39;t send me out there. I don&#39;t know nothing from out there. I ain&#39;t got nothing to do anything. What am I supposed to do out here?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old were you when you</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp; this happened, when you started that case?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 17. When I caught my case. Yeah. I was 17.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know you and your partner at the time, you knew she was pregnant, around then?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I knew she was pregnant, but at that time we actually separated because of her family, like her mom never liked me. And I was</span><span class="c0">&hellip;</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;we were actually living together. At 15, already living together. </span><span class="c0">Like man,</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;she just hated the fact of how I lived. And her mom hated the fact of how I lived and I don&#39;t know, she ended up eventually taking </span><span class="c0">her</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;from me. It got to that point where we just ended up separating from all the things that were going on and stuff. Yeah</span><span class="c0">,</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;I knew she was pregnant, but when I caught my case</span><span class="c0">, I was </span><span class="c2 c0">out there in the streets, I wasn&#39;t thinking about her to be honest.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;W</span><span class="c0">hat did you&hellip; w</span><span class="c2 c0">as it the decision for both of you that you guys wanted to get pregnant?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, yeah. I mean, it just happened. Right. But I mean, we both agreed on it when she was pregnant with it. Yeah. And my girl, she was actually a US citizen. She&#39;s born over there. She&#39;s from over there. But, like yeah, we both agreed on it, yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want a baby?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, my mom would kill me if I were to do some crazy other thing. Yeah. She would</span><span class="c0">&ndash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What made you want to have a baby?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well just. Nothing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;made me want to have it</span><span class="c0 c3">, like I said, it just happened spontaneously, but I mean, we were just like happy about it. If it happened, it happened. I mean, things happen for a reason. Right. </span><span class="c0">N</span><span class="c2 c0">othing&#39;s an accident like they say. And I do believe that. I mean, everything just happens for a reason. Like they say, I could have probably been shot, killed out there maybe, but I don&#39;t know. Sometimes I do think like that, but at the end of the day, I feel like I don&#39;t belong here. I just want to be out there.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you said that you guys were living at 15 together?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you got separated from her when?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Like two </span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;years later because of other things. She wanted me to stop doing things that I couldn&#39;t do because I was like, &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; Because I just couldn&#39;t stop doing it. It was just not addictions or anything like that. It was just, she wanted me to get out of gang life. She wanted me to stop selling drugs, but it was like, &quot;If I stopped doing that then how am I supposed to provide for you and actually help out around?&quot; Like I had a job, but I mean, you gotta buy food over there. We wasn&#39;t getting no government help, no aid, like how people get link, stamp cards and stuff. It was just us. So basically I had to work double. I mean we had to work for food. And if you wanted nice things, she wanted clothes, you want</span><span class="c0">ed </span><span class="c2 c0">shoes. I mean, you got to work for that too.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">So you guys were a</span><span class="c2 c0">t 17, were you guys living together before you got the case?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time? No. She</span><span class="c0">, like </span><span class="c0 c3">at 17, there was for a couple months. Yeah. We were still living together. And then like I said, her mom one day she just like, &quot;I&#39;m taking my daughter.&quot; </span><span class="c0">And she</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;went along with it and she ended up leaving me because I guess-</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did she know she was pregnant then?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she was pregnant. She knew. That&#39;s the whole reason why they took her from me because she was pregnant, and they didn&#39;t want her to be living like how we </span><span class="c0">were</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;liv</span><span class="c0">ing</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;basically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then after she got pregnant, you caught the case, </span><span class="c0">and were</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;in jail before the baby was born.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I caught my case before the baby was born.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like, seeing your baby for the first time?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Man. It was really, really sad, man. Had to see </span><span class="c0">her</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;through a glass window. I can&#39;t even hug her. I can&#39;t even do anything, but just see her, just know that she&#39;s there, I can&#39;t provide for her. I&#39;m locked up. I can&#39;t do anything. Right now, I just see her through Skype, FaceTime, all these years she&#39;s been </span><span class="c0">growing</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;up with me and it&#39;s just like, &quot;When are you coming down here, daddy? And then I&#39;m just like, &quot;One day.&quot; But one day she&#39;s going to, I don&#39;t know, I just don&#39;t want her to hate me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old is she now?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know she&#39;s seven. She&#39;s going to seven. She&#39;s going to be seven, August 28th. Her name is </span><span class="c0">______</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;. I got a tattoo of her here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">_________</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">_______</span><span class="c0 c3">. It means </span><span class="c0">God of </span><span class="c0 c3">fertility, according to my baby mama </span><span class="c0">la diosa de la fertilidad</span><span class="c0 c3">. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><span class="c2 c0">And I don&#39;t know what language, that&#39;s what she named it. _________ But I mean, yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she ever come visit you?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re actually planning on it. Hopefully by December, she comes out here. I mean, we had talked about it before, but she cost money. She&#39;s on her own. My baby mama, she&#39;s on her own. </span><span class="c0">And it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;just like difficult for her, I guess. But hopefully by the end of this year or starting the beginning of the new year, I get to see my daughter for the first time. Yeah, hopefully. But&ndash;</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you scared about that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m actually nervous, scared. I don&#39;t know what to do. Luckily I have this job</span><span class="c0">.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;But I know if I still have this job, God willingly, I know I&#39;m going to be okay. But I&#39;m just scared. I don&#39;t know, she&#39;s actually old enough to realize things now. I just don&#39;t want her, like I mentioned to you earlier, just hating me and stuff like that. Asking why I wasn&#39;t right there? And then not giving her an answer like, &quot;Oh, I was stupid. I was a young ass kid.&quot; I don</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;t </span><span class="c2 c0">want to tell her all that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So since you&#39;ve been back, do you think you&#39;ve changed your lifestyle and like your mentality?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a lot. I mean Like how they say it out here, &quot;</span><span class="c0">estamos en M&eacute;xico, no estamos en Los Estados Unidos</span><span class="c0 c3">.&quot; </span><span class="c0 c3">[We</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;re in Mexico, we&rsquo;re not in the United States].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;You got to. </span><span class="c0 c3">My mentality over there was not give a damn about anything and over here, you actually got</span><span class="c0">ta</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;fear for your life, you got to fe</span><span class="c0">ar</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;for your phone, for your freaking earnings and shit. You can&#39;t even wear a good chain around here, good shoes around your neighborhood without somebody noticing them and wanting to take it from you. </span><span class="c0">Like yeah, it&rsquo;s messed up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what </span><span class="c0">happened</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;w</span><span class="c0">hen&hellip; h</span><span class="c2 c0">ow&#39;d you end up in ICE?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended up in ICE after I finished my case. They picked me up. After I finished my case, they were already outside </span><span class="c0">in </span><span class="c2 c0">the paddy wagon waiting for me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you finished your...</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My felony case.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were free from jail.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was free from jail, but they&#39;re outside waiting for you with the paddy wagon, with the immigration deportee paper already.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know they were going to deport you at that time?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I knew. I mean right away when you </span><span class="c0">enter</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the County, they classify you. If you&#39;re a deportee they put you with a yellow wristband. And if you&#39;re not a deportee, if you&#39;re just a regular inmate, they put you with a blue wristband, with your inmate ID number, your name and your date of birth, all your information, basically.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often did you have to wear that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyday. I mean, if you were to take it off or anything like that, you would actually get sent to the hole for that. It was like your name badge. You had to wear it every day, so the COs could identify you.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever get targeted because you had the yellow one and not the blue one?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because I mean right away they knew you&#39;re getting deported, bro, right? Yeah. I guess like, because I would actually see other inmates that were the same nationalities as I was, they would have the yellow wristbands too. </span><span class="c0">They</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;would be like older Mexicans just getting caught driving, or they were drinking too much, and they ended up catching a case, man. That is crazy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now, how was your experience when you were in the ICE Detention Facility?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like I was doing time still. I was still locked up. I was in the cell. They was still </span><span class="c0">locked</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;me down. I was supposed to be free, but yet I was doing time. </span><span class="c0">Like it</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;felt bogus, I still did a whole, like I said, I spent like a week and in Pontiac </span><span class="c0">F</span><span class="c2 c0">arms and then afterwards I went to McHenry County. I did like a whole month still when I was supposed to be let free, you know? I was still doing time, still eating State food. I mean, It was bogus. I guess they had me on a waiting list to get shipped out, out here. And I had to wait the whole month. It was bogus. I ain&#39;t like it.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then when you arrived in Mexico for the first time, </span><span class="c0">were you</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;then greeted by any one?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I almost got robbed like I told you earlier. I was never greeted by anybody. I actually handed a hundred dollar bill to a cop. He was actually telling me he was going to get it changed for me, but somebody else noticed it and he was like, bro, go get your money. They&#39;re not going to help you. They&#39;re going to stain you. And I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, hold on, hold on. What up? I got change, I got change. My guy got me on change, give me my money back.&quot; He was hesitating a little bit, but he eventually ended up giving it to me. I was scared. I got dropped off in the border </span><span class="c0">at</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;Matamoros.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t know anything. They didn&#39;t even drop me off here how they do it now. Now they&#39;re dropping people off in the </span><span class="c0">D.F.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and like, when I see people at T-tech working, and before I&#39;m like, &quot;Bro, I got dropped off in Matamoros.&quot; And they&#39;re like, &quot;What? I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;But how&#39;d you make it?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t know how I even made it, bro. I just made it out here. God, thank God man.&quot; Because </span><span class="c0">it was just</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;so so scary because all the taxis would all pull up to you, one like, &quot;Oh I got to get in, get in, get in, get in. And you just like, &quot;Man, calm down, calm down.&quot; And then you see like military people in the bus stations, you see cops everywhere. And you&#39;re just like, you hear everything you&#39;ve heard about Mexico, decapitations and gangs getting </span><span class="c0 c13">secuestrado</span><span class="c0">, (kidnapped)</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and all that stuff. And all that stuff was running through my mind. I&#39;m like, Oh God, please help.&quot; But </span><span class="c0">can</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I get picked up around here please.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just went to the nearest bus station, told the taxi guy to take me to the </span><span class="c0">nearest</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;as best as I could. He ended up taking me there. I just want </span><span class="c0">a </span><span class="c0 c13">boleto</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[ticket]</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;to Morelos. They&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, we don&#39;t do </span><span class="c0 c13">boleto</span><span class="c0 c13 c3">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0 c3">to Morelos, you would actually have to get dropped off in Mexico </span><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c0 c3">ity, and then Mexico </span><span class="c0">C</span><span class="c0 c3">ity take one to Morel</span><span class="c0">os</span><span class="c0 c3">. So I ended up taking the whole bus to Mexico city and then going to my native state Morelos. But it was hard, man. Like I wouldn&#39;t even get off the bus when they would do their little stops. Because I would actually be so scared of going out there. And then the first time I ended up going out, I still had American money and I bought a coffee and this lady</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;didn&rsquo;t even give me my</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;change back.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was just like, what the hell? Like I didn&#39;t even know how to even fight about it. Like, </span><span class="c0">give me</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;my change back. I was just like, man, I&#39;m not even getting off no more. When the </span><span class="c0 c3 c13">torta</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;guy comes up and just buy me a </span><span class="c0 c13 c3">torta</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;and just... They used to get on the buses before we used to leave, trying to sell food and stuff. I was actually pretty shook. Like I didn&#39;t know where I was at. Like I said, everything was just a new world</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to me</span><span class="c2 c0">. Everything was just new.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, I&#39;d just be looking outside the bus. Like where am I at? On my inside. You don&#39;t see that in the US. You see streets are </span><span class="c0 c13">planos</span><span class="c0 c3">,(flat/paved) &nbsp;beautiful streets right here, man. This is the only good thing about the city. And it&#39;s not even that beautiful, look what you got, you got bumps living outside the monument. you would never see stuff like that in the US</span><span class="c0">. P</span><span class="c0 c3">eople outside of a historical, like, come on, man. Cops right here are so crooked, man. You got to be a</span><span class="c0">fraid </span><span class="c2 c0">cops right here, man. You got to be afraid of these guys. Like they know tomorrow we get paid. They know tomorrow as the fifth, you&#39;re going to see a lot of cops running through here. Just searching people for no reason just because they know we get paid. And they know like if like, if they&#39;re like they know who to classify, they classify.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they see you all tatt</span><span class="c0">ed up.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;They see you like you&#39;re looking crazy and stuff. By the way they pull you over, because they immediately think that you got drugs on you. Life over here it&#39;s no joke, man. Like this is life right here. Right you actually got to know how to survive. Like to be honest in the US like you have </span><span class="c0">it sweet, yeah</span><span class="c2 c0">, but right here, it&#39;s tough, man. Right here, like I said, you got to be on the lookout for everything. Everybody over here is crazy. Everybody over here can&#39;t be going to different neighborhoods like that. Like, man, come on. Like I said, like right away they know you&#39;re not from here.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They hate you for that reason, just because you once upon a time you had a good lifestyle, I guess. And they never had that, and right away they think you got money, just because you&#39;re from over there. But little </span><span class="c0">do</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;they know I&#39;m as messed up as they are? I got to work, bro. Trust me if I had it like that, I wouldn&#39;t even be working. No, I can&#39;t be </span><span class="c0">d</span><span class="c2 c0">epending on my family, we&#39;ve grown. I&#39;m supposed to be providing for them. That&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you came back, you went </span><span class="c0">to Morelos state</span><span class="c0 c3">. </span><span class="c0">Who&rsquo;d</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;you stay with </span><span class="c0">there</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my uncles, </span><span class="c0">my</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;mom&#39;s brother.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Was it chill?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we actually had problems because he would actually try to boss me around like he was my father and I&#39;m like, &quot;Whoa.&quot; And he would tell my mom other things, he would exaggerate on things. Like I would ask</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c3">have me a drink or two. But he would actually be like, &quot;Oh, your son did this and that.&quot; And then I wouldn&#39;t even eat at their home. And my mom was sending him money for me to eat. And I&#39;d be like, &quot;Why are you sending the money? I don&#39;t even </span><span class="c0">eat</span><span class="c0 c3">, they don&#39;t even offer me a fuckin</span><span class="c0">&rsquo; </span><span class="c0 c3">plate.&quot; Like, &quot;Why are you doing that?&quot; And then like I said, they were just my own family was robbing my family. So I had to get out of there. I can</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;t be doing&hellip; </span><span class="c2 c0">I can&#39;t disrespect him. That&#39;s my uncle. It&#39;s my mom&#39;s brother.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you decided to come to </span><span class="c0">the city</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now that you&#39;re working here, you do Skype with your daughter, do you send money there?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, I&#39;ve tried, but my baby mama she doesn&#39;t allow that. I mean, she thinks like it&#39;s nice and cute of me. Right. But I mean, my money&#39;s not worth anything over there. She actually be offering me to send me money. Like, &quot;Nah, don&#39;t do that. Let me send you some money.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t do that. I&#39;m good, you know. I</span><span class="c0">&rsquo;,</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;not going to be taking money off of you, and I&#39;m the one supposed to be giving you money for my kid.&quot; Like I said, things are backwards here</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c0 c3">I guess</span><span class="c0">.</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;it&#39;s just messed up mine. I don&#39;t like it. I still feel after four years, I still don&#39;t belong here, y</span><span class="c0">ou know?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You feel more American than Mexican?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c2">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Not like that either. I actually love being Mexican, but I actually just feel like my whole life is out there, bro. I ain&#39;t grow up here. All these guys, they grew up right here in the same neighborhood. They grew up going to the same school together. I swear my life is my friends, my family, my life is out there. I don&#39;t got nothing to do out here. I don&#39;t got no friends here. I ain&#39;t got no family here, family like sisters, brothers, mom, I don&#39;t got family like that out here. So what am I doing? Ain&#39;t nothing out here for me.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll go back?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hopefully, man, like I said, I really want to go back. Financially. It&#39;s that neediness helps me back, money. </span><span class="c0">B</span><span class="c2 c0">ecause like I said, my sisters are married. They got two, three kids. My mom she&#39;s working for her to survive. She&#39;s old too. she&#39;s not as young as she used to be. She can&#39;t work as much as she used to. And like I said, it was just money, the only thing holding me back, but hopefully one day, one day God willingly. I have to, I mean, I had a daughter, I got my family out there. What am I going to do here? There ain&#39;t nothing out here for me bro. I tell you, nothing.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span class="c0">o, i</span><span class="c0 c3">s there anything you thin</span><span class="c0">k that </span><span class="c2 c0">can improve where your situation is.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. What was that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything you think that would improve your situation? Like any changes to the law and changes </span><span class="c0">to the way things are</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah man. I mean they should first the dog case slap on the wrist. They first a dog case gets shipped out there and they don&#39;t even know somebody&#39;s background. They don&#39;t know, all they see you as a immigrant, but bro, I mean</span><span class="c0">, </span><span class="c2 c0">you know how long I been here? Like I been here since I was two years old bro. I grew up over here, bro like, what are you going to send me out there for, like you know? Why? That&#39;s the real honest, why is it I&#39;m more from here than not there?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think being in the US has shaped who you are now and shaped your beliefs?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. What was that?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that being in the U S for so long has shaped who you are now and shaped everything you </span><span class="c0">believe</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know how to answer that, bro. Can you rephrase it in another way?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After being in the US for so long, do you think being in the US has made you the person you are today </span><span class="c0">and how is that different from---</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. Yeah. It has made me the person I am today, because I mean, if I didn&#39;t grow up how I grew up, I would have probably been a different person, but I know if I would&#39;ve probably grew up here, I would have probably been dead or shot. I mean, like I told you, I lived in the </span><span class="c0">centro</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;right there in Morelos. That&#39;s where I&#39;m from. I seen pretty crazy things out there. And like I said, I know if I would&#39;ve stayed up growing up here, I would have probably been dead, or I would probably been one of these guys out here, staying in the streets, I would probably got lost in drug addictions because I mean, over there, you grow up with a mentality like, you want to be the man around the block. And </span><span class="c0">over</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;here, all these guys want to do is get messed up.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would probably have been worse if I would&#39;ve grew up out here. And thank God I had a good lifestyle. I can&#39;t complain. Like I said, </span><span class="c0">I had</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;family things, I went out to the beach. I went to school. I had every day I was always used to be into sports. I was everyday thing like my life wasn&#39;t messed up. And so far since I&#39;ve been here in Mexico I mean, and I used to be fatter, I lost weight. I&#39;m not eating as I used, how I used to. I used to have money. Right here, I got to be working 11 hours a day for me to get decent money. And it&#39;s still not enough because you still can&#39;t get the things that you want. It&#39;s just for you to survive.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what it sounds like is, when you came back, you avoided like crime here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Because like I said, I was actually scared out here. I mean, I wasn&#39;t in my neighborhood. I was in somebody else&#39;s country. And then all the things that I would hear about Mexico, like really got to me. I can&#39;t be doing the things that I was doing out there. Like right here, you try selling the drugs, man, they&#39;ll come and kill you right away. And </span><span class="c0">you </span><span class="c2 c0">can&#39;t sell drugs anywhere around here. Right here, everybody got their territory, I guess. And it was just hard on here, man.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you were to return to the US, do you think you would go back to who you were before?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0 c3">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Never, because I actually know what&#39;s real now. I would never go back to what I used to be, man. Because my friends, so-called friends, they&#39;re actually living the life right now, actually out there enjoying their kids. Some of them got kids, married, they got nice cars. And I know I could have had that. And I was already 15. I already had more things in a lot of guys&#39; </span><span class="c0">my age</span><span class="c0 c3">&nbsp;should have had at the time. I mean, I know I was going to make it regardless. And no, I would not go back to that, because like I said, I actually know who&#39;s real now. I know that my family is real, they&#39;re the ones that stuck with me throughout this whole time, they&#39;re still the ones with me. When I need help financially, they&#39;re the ones that helped me. When I need help, just help period, they&#39;re there for me. Nobody else is there. But </span><span class="c0">damn</span><span class="c2 c0">, yeah bro.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c0 c3">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">And your daughter, too?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c0">Alejandro:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My daughter. But I know one day she&#39;s going to have to ask about me regardless. Like I said too, she&#39;s going to want to meet me. So I know one day I&#39;m going to meet her regardless too, but I just want to go out there and do things different. Actually, I don&#39;t know, just do things different, do everything that I wasn&#39;t supposed to do.</span></p><p class="c4" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Sergio</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That covers all the questions I have.
