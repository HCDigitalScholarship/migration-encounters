I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">was weird.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How come?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Maybe I was mad. I was mad in school, so I acted up, so I probably wouldn&#39;t be friends with them. So instead of that, I used to hang around with Caucasian people, Filipino people, African-American, Cambodians. I ended up getting Filipino, Asian friends, so I split from that culture.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you were mad at?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad</span><span>. T</span><span class="c1 c0">he rules.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Do you remember, did you get in a lot of trouble at school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I always wanted to get suspended. It was just out of anger. I just want to be home.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it work? Did you get suspended?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. I got what I wanted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you finish high school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I did. Luckily, luckily I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you deal with your anger?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably at eighth grade, I got tired of it. I said, &quot;You know what, I&#39;m done.&quot; Just changed. Ever since that, it has always been that way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Did somebody help you? Was there a teacher who helped you or do you remember?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do remember one of my teachers, _______, she gave me this book called, </span><span class="c0 c17">Always Running</span><span class="c1 c0">, by Luis Rodriguez.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that book.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a good book. And I started reading it and she said, like, &quot;Maybe this is not appropriate for your age, but I just feel like it might help you.&quot; And I was like, &quot;I&#39;ll just read it.&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to read it, but then I actually started reading it and I liked it. So I finished the book and it </span><span>helped</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me up a little bit, to get out of that anger.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you a good student after that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I always noticed that I could pick up stuff, but I always had that anger, that I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t want to do it. I don&#39;t want to read, I don&#39;t want to do my homework. I&#39;m out of here. I&#39;m going to go work.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you attracted to street gangs and that kind of stuff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not too much. Because at 16, my mom said, &quot;Do you want to work? Because you don&#39;t even go to school, you don&#39;t do anything.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;I might as well. Yeah, I&#39;ll go work.&quot; So I was like 15 or 16, and she was like, &quot;Here, here&#39;s your fake papers, and if they ask you, you&#39;re 18, you look 18.&quot; So I was like, &quot;All right, yeah.&quot; So I just picked the work, and I liked it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of work did you do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jack in the Box. I didn&#39;t work with my mom, but at another Jack in the Box. They actually were looking into me becoming a supervisor there, and I was just like, &quot;Nah, I&#39;m too young.&quot; They offered, I was like, &quot;Nah, I&#39;m just too young.&quot; They didn&#39;t know that, but I was just like, &quot;No, no, no.&quot; But actually just rather than going to school, I would rather go to work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you feel less angry at work?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I felt happy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think was the difference?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mind, my mind was busy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your mind wasn&#39;t busy at school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I wouldn&#39;t focus. I was just looking to things, getting into fights or just finding ways to go home.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Because when I was little, my sisters got taken away by the government.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The state.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They got taken away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. One of them was 13, she got pregnant, so the government took both of them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did they take them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To live with the County, shelter homes, foster care.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old was your other sister?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>S</span><span class="c1 c0">he was 12 because we all go by one.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was 12, like 10 or 11. Because we all go by one year. So that&#39;s where it was also my anger, that I didn&#39;t have my sisters anymore. My mom was all left crying. So everything was going bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was this because of your stepdad that they took them away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got pregnant when she was 13?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you get to see them? Did you know where they were? Were they in a different state? Were they in the Bay area?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they were in ______, but we can only see them once a week, and by somebody else watching, supervision. In the beginning it was just tough because my mom was really crushed. And I was the only one left behind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just came one day and took them away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was at school when all that happened, when they actually went down. So when I got home it was just like, &quot;What happened?&quot; Mom&#39;s crying, nobody home. Don&#39;t tell you much when you&#39;re that age.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. </span><span>[crying ] </span><span class="c0">Oh my God.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">So what happened to you? How&#39;d you end up back here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I picked up drug use when I turned 18. So the reason why also, just to escape. Not to mention what happened to my sisters and mom, but it happened to me too, right after they took them away.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened to you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Same thing-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took you away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn&#39;t take me away, but same thing happened to me. I was a victim of the same crime, rape.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were the victim of a rape?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, by my stepdad too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your stepdad rape your sister?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that why she was pregnant?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if it was rape or how that all worked out, but for me, I never-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that what you think?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I don&#39;t know what that story is all about, but for me, it was rape. I was little, I didn&#39;t know what was going on or what to say, what to do, so I just kept it all inside me.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So wait a minute, your stepdad raped your sister, and she became pregnant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took them away, and then he raped you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He was still free because he was on the run. My mom didn&#39;t know what was really going on, and so my mom was like, &quot;Well, I got to go to work, can you take care of him while I go to work? And then we&#39;ll figure out what&#39;s going on and what we&#39;re going to do.&quot; And I guess that&#39;s when it happened to me. And when she got home, he disappeared. From there, I never saw him, I just knew he was in jail. But my mom never knew all that. It&#39;s not nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then you got involved in drugs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not too much, I did get into, but I didn&#39;t [inaudible 00:15:18] drugs-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But they didn&#39;t take you and put you in a shelter?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because they never asked me questions, it happened after sisters. Everybody just thought it was them.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he Mexican, your stepdad?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was from Honduras. My sister was like, I don&#39;t know, they always had a fear that something was going to happen to me, and they always checked up on me when they took him, but it was already late.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So then after that, you started working pretty young and you got involved in some drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Drugs, yeah. I used to sleep a lot actually, depression. That&#39;s why they called me Bear, because I used to sleep 18 hours a day or more. I wouldn&#39;t go to school, I would just be sleeping. Like, &quot;What are you doing bro? &quot;Sleeping.&quot; &quot;You didn&#39;t go to school?&quot; &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to go to school, I just want to sleep.&quot; My mom too, she&#39;s like, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? You&#39;re smoking weed or something?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I&#39;m just sleepy. I just want to sleep.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;There&#39;s something wrong with you.&quot; I don&#39;t know. That&#39;s when I started using drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard drugs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I start off with marijuana. Pot head. Go out with friends and go hike or bike, roller blade, go river rafting, just go outdoors. And then it came to harder drugs, cocaine, shrooms, acid, Molly, ecstasy, crystal too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And were you working at the same time as you were doing all this?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I always worked. I just liked going to raves, parties, driving fast. Didn&#39;t like alcohol, just uppers and downers too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how&#39;d you end up back here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty much, I had a case where I was being charged for embezzlement, and I forgot to go to court. And so what happens, since I didn&#39;t go to court, I had a warrant out for my arrest. So they took me to court, ended up taking care of my case. They&#39;re like, &quot;</span><span>T</span><span class="c1 c0">here&#39;s no citation. You&#39;re good to go.&quot; When that happened, I got picked up by INS, they interviewed me and they found out I was illegal, so they ended up shooting me back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you detained?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how long?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well they gave me the option, &quot;You want to go fight your case? Or you want to just go ahead and exit out?&quot; And they&#39;re like, &quot;We see your record here. Seven counts of marijuana, driving under the influence of ecstasy. You&#39;re done, you might as well sign out.&quot; But to me, I had never spoken about that, so I was like, </span><span class="c0">&quot;You know what? I really want to go see the judge. There&#39;s something I got to just say that I need to get off my chest and I&#39;m not leaving until I say it.&quot; So they was like, &quot;All right, well, you&#39;re going to be there three months, and you&#39;re not going to be able to leave until them three months are over.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;That&#39;s fine. I already paid my crime, so I&#39;m free, so I&#39;m just going to go ahead and take care of that. I know I&#39;m going to go to Mexico eventually, I know how this works, but I just want to speak up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you get a chance?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The officer was like, he says, &quot;Just sign.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not going to sign. Just send me to where I need to go.&quot; The officer didn&#39;t want me to go to the judge.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He actually wanted you to ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he just wanted me to sign out. He&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, you&#39;re right here, you&#39;ll be in Mexico by tonight.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;I don&#39;t want to go to Mexico tonight. I need to have something to take care of.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think he was being a good guy?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think he didn&#39;t know my situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you appear before judge?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what&#39;d you say?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">Well, I pretty much told my story and how it all went down.

They&#39;re just mad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom too?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom passed away 12 years ago.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you must&#39;ve been pretty mad at your mom too?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Never?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. That&#39;s what I try to stay straight sometimes, because my mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what&#39;s the hardest thing about here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Work, people, police.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about work, people and police? Let&#39;s take one by one, start with the police. What&#39;s hard about the police?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m just used to, if you get into some kind of trouble, obviously you&#39;re going to go to jail, and here it&#39;s not that way. They just see how much money you have. So at the end it&#39;s like, &quot;Sure, I&#39;m going to pay you a thousand right now, just so I can get out of this and go home.&quot; But when I&#39;m walking away, I feel like, what good did that do for me? Nothing. All I know is that I need to have money, if I&#39;m doing bad stuff here. I didn&#39;t learn nothing. And over there, every time I got in trouble, I learned. I had to go to classes, like anger management classes or pay your debt, so that way you won&#39;t go back to jail, stuff like that. And here, police is like that. Here also, the police has robbed me too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Robbed my for my chain, my gold, my diamonds. They just see what you have, and if it&#39;s good, they&#39;ll take it. If not, they won&#39;t mess with you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about the people? What&#39;s hard about the people here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t understand the culture that we come from.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you describe that culture?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure how, it&#39;s more radical, I would say, with no fear. Over there, I didn&#39;t ever live with fear, here, I do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I come in the little transportation, and you see these two guys just coming to you, I just throw my stuff on the floor, panic. &quot;That ain&#39;t mine.&quot; You just panic when you see strange people coming up to the bus. Just panic.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And work?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well here at the call centers, it&#39;s great. But other places, it&#39;s really tough to maintain a job because people envy, like, &quot;Oh, you speak English? Oh, then you don&#39;t need this job.&quot; And they just make it harder for you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the teacher who gave you Rodriguez&#39;s book, Always Running? Wilson? What was her name?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;________.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;________.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;ll never forget that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have there been any people like that, any Mexicans you&#39;ve met who&#39;ve ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In TJ, when I was really doing bad, I mean, I was ready to commit suicide and fortunately, I didn&#39;t want to. And there was one good friend that helped me out, if it wouldn&#39;t have been for him, I probably would have been right back in the same hole. I always remember him. Name is _______, he pretty much helped me out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he was a Mexican?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he was Mexican, but I think he was also in the States for a couple of times.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel that you and the other people who lived in the States, can you talk to them? Do they understand where you&#39;re coming from?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But at the end, everybody lives so far here that it&#39;s not that same communication, like with my friends that I had over there. Like, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m going to ride my bike to your house. I&#39;ll be there in 10 minutes.&quot; That&#39;s not here, lives across the town, the other guy over here. We&#39;re so spread apart that that bond, we might have it here at work, but once you&#39;re not there, it&#39;s gone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So this is what you don&#39;t like about here. What do you like and as you look back, what do you like, or if you look today, what do you like and what don&#39;t you like about the US?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I always liked everything from the US.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Even if I got in trouble, I always had respect for the law, my friends. Even for me, all right, I know I did dumb stuff, like, all right, I want to actually take care of that. I turned myself in. I liked the States actually, I miss the States, but my attitude is what got me kicked out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m really, really sorry about all that shit.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, when I started, two years after I got out here, I was able to express that with my friends and people. It was really hard, still is hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you still fight depression?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pressure to speak up?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Feel depressed?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, always. Always. Always.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you get help here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought of it? Are there services available? I mean, I&#39;ve talked to so many people who are in same situations, who&#39;ve been deported or who&#39;ve come back and so many people feel, in some ways, similar things to what you&#39;re describing to me. Either because everything being taken away from them and being sent home or because of the terrible things that they grew up with. I just wonder whether there are any services available for returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really. Not here. They have rehab, but it&#39;s not like a pretty rehab here. I&#39;ve heard they pee on you, kick you, they don&#39;t feed you, they pretty much do whatever they want. That&#39;s not rehab.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you ever think of going back to the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. </span><span>Rather</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;stay here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">I wouldn&#39;t ever go illegally. I wouldn&#39;t go back illegally, that&#39;s the truth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fear, I don&#39;t want to die. I&#39;ll die out here, but I don&#39;t want to just die because I wanted to cross the desert and got bit by some snakes and couldn&#39;t walk anymore and immigration didn&#39;t pass, and I died there. That&#39;s my fear. Or getting left behind with a broken ankle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s of the crossing that you&#39;re afraid?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if you were able to make it to the US, would you live illegally in the US again?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I live legally?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. If you could make it, if somebody said, &quot;We guarantee you, you&#39;re not going to be bitten by a snake, nothing is going to happen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would I go? No. Money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s too much money.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. To get there is like 10 G&#39;s. I don&#39;t want to pay 10 G&#39;s.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What if somebody gave it to you for free, they will give you a free ride?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well, </span><span>[laughs] </span><span class="c1 c0">even that. There&#39;s always a catch.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m trying to play hypotheticals with you here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, there&#39;s always a catch. They do it here, like, &quot;Hey, carry these bags of whatever merchandise is in there, and you&#39;re free to go once you&#39;ve delivered.&quot; I would never probably do any of that stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? They make you these offers?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they definitely do, they do. They&#39;re out there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to let you go to work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got time still.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So then, I want to push you on the States then again, and your experiences. Do you think that the fact of being illegal, as you guys call it, we don&#39;t call it that</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>W</span><span class="c1 c0">e say, unauthorized or irregular or something else, but all you guys talk about yourselves as being illegals.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Word&#39;s probably undocumented.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, now it&#39;s all changed, it&#39;s unauthorized or irregular, is the cool words, is the proper words that we </span><span>w</span><span class="c1 c0">hite people use. I&#39;m going to use your term. So all this stuff that you went through, do you think that if you had been legal, it might&#39;ve been different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, to change, a lot of people don&#39;t have that willingness to change. When you don&#39;t have motivation, you don&#39;t. There&#39;s nobody to look up to. So you just know we&#39;re going down, down, down. That&#39;s why I never continued studying. I seen a lot of people that was in the same situation, &quot;I&#39;m going to _____.&quot; I would say to myself, &quot;Why would I go to _____, when I know it&#39;s not going to bring me-&quot;</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s ______?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College, _____ College.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why would I go to college for, it&#39;s not going to benefit me when I get kicked out? Maybe I was wrong because it helps you here in call centers, but the Americanized way doesn&#39;t help you at all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about the stuff with your stepdad and your mom? Do you think that if your mom had to work less? I mean, I don&#39;t know, I&#39;m trying to figure ...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If it wouldn&#39;t have been from my dad&#39;s fault, I think we would&#39;ve been all right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dad,</span><span>&nbsp;dad</span><span class="c1 c0">?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my dad, dad. He never would have left us, I think we were at least good citizens out there. We never would&#39;ve got into all that bad stuff we had to go through.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your dad alive?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any contact with him?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went out to look for him three years ago.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">It&#39;s been rough. It&#39;s even gotten worse, so I stopped talking to him because I just get mad at him. Start talking crazy, all that hate comes out. And he don&#39;t understand, he has another wife and four other kids in the States now. So now when I ask him, &quot;Hey, you know what, this happened to me and I got robbed. I got nothing.&quot; &quot;Let me check it out and see if I can help you.&quot; &quot;All right, man. Cool. You know what? I don&#39;t even want the help anymore.&quot; And I just start cussing. I get mad at him too much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you look like your dad or like your mom?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my mom, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And does he try and stay in touch with you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He tries to understand, but he don&#39;t get it. He&#39;s too busy with his other life. That&#39;s what I&#39;ve noticed in this last three years, that&#39;s what I just see, he&#39;s just all about his other kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about your sisters?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t talk to him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And to you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1 c0">They stopped talking to me three years ago. They&#39;re like, &quot;You know what? You&#39;re on your own. We&#39;ve helped you ever since you got out of here, and you don&#39;t want to change, it&#39;s on you now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to change?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know. I try though, can&#39;t say I don&#39;t. I try.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you imagine a different life for yourself?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it so hard?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just get used to it. You get used to it. Since 15 years already smoking weed and drugs, you kind of just get that. You hear somebody like, &quot;Come on, man, let&#39;s go smoke. You&#39;re going to come back and do your job even better.&quot; That&#39;s what we do, it just makes us happy sometimes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you still do it here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I tried quitting, but it just comes back again. I can hold off for a year, two years, and then, there&#39;s Juan again, smoking weed again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it just weed here or is it other stuff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything&#39;s here, but weed is the main base.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is weed legal here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s not legal here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a reason to go back to California.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, get my cannabis card. Honestly, I feel like I belong here because my mom, she always fought for her house that&#39;s still here and still under her name. So that&#39;s one reason I&#39;m actually happy to being here because I got my mom&#39;s house and that&#39;s what she always fought for as soon as we were over there. When my dad left us, he didn&#39;t care. And that&#39;s what&#39;s still standing, and it&#39;s also keeping me alive.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s where you&#39;re living?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. That&#39;s where I&#39;m living.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how far away from here is it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like about an hour and a half.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re going to do the hour and a half commute every day now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And the good thing at this job, they pay the Uber going back home.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh they do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So I&#39;ll be closing at 12:00 and they pay my ride home, which is really cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So there&#39;s pros and cons here, but you got to look at the bright side though.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it an American company?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a Mexican company?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s a Mexican company. It&#39;s not a sad story at the end. Not yet, at least.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about your sisters? You don&#39;t know what&#39;s become of them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when I left there, they already had their kids and husbands, they&#39;re all set, they had good jobs and their cars and kids in school. So I&#39;m pretty sure they&#39;re doing great.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in a sense, they were saved by being taken away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you ever wish that you would have been taken away?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, but no, because everything that I stuck with my mom is what always makes you be happy and stand up for the right thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think if your mom had to work less, it would have been different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe, because she had two jobs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two jobs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She worked day and night.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you never saw her?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We saw her at late, late night and then we had to go to school in the morning, so it was mom for a couple hours and she&#39;d go to work. We were always alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So who made you dinner?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom always left food ready just for us to eat. So older sister would heat it up and make sure we eat. But once they were gone, it&#39;s just me. That&#39;s when my life changed a lot. It&#39;s funny though, I still see myself alone here, just like when I was a little kid. That&#39;s how I see myself here because I&#39;ve been here six years and have not been able to find a good decent girlfriend and I have a life, a good career. These jobs are good, but for some reason you just get fed up and you&#39;re like, &quot;I haven&#39;t been able to succeed here the way I wanted.&quot; Hopefully that will change. Hopefully. You get tired though. It&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any questions for me, Juan?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Want to know why I&#39;m doing this stupid thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want to know wh</span><span>y</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m doing this stupid thing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you want to tell me, that&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, I think it&#39;s important that people understand what happens to the conditions under which &quot;illegals&quot; live and the kinds of experiences you have and the challenges that you face about being sent back to a country that you&#39;ve never known. And I think that it&#39;s important to understand that, and it&#39;s important for your stories and experiences to be known because if we have any hope of people who know nothing, who make judgments and have opinions, change them, then maybe we need to give them some information and some real stories. That&#39;s why I&#39;m doing it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m glad. That&#39;s why I came. They told me about the money, but I was like, &quot;I just want to be heard too. It&#39;s going to help me out, but I just want to talk it out.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;d be really great if you had the opportunity to be able to talk, it seems like you really want to talk, just like with even the judge. Having a place to go and talk, I think might change your life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Juan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely.</span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c2 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c3 c0"></span></p><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c9 c16"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c14"><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c6 c0">compassion</span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c6 c0">The first time I heard this part of the interview, I sobbed</span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a><span class="c6 c0">does not fit into parts we were assigned to denote, but...</span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a><span class="c6 c0">empathy?</span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a><span class="c0 c6">lack of empathy and solidarity</span></p></div><div class="c8"><p class="c4"><a href="#cmnt_ref6" id="cmnt6">[f]</a><span class="c6 c0">lack of solidarity, empathy</span></p></div></body></html>
