But all of those grades, I studied them here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Perfect, that&#39;s what I wanted to know. And you worked in Mexico before you went to Newport Beach, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;These questions are weird for you, but-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many years did you work in Mexico before you went to Newport Beach? Or whenever it is that you went for the longer period of time to the States. You said you went to Albany too, didn&#39;t you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was at the same time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was before.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went to Albany for two years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, In Albany I was there like for three months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So the longest time you were in the States, was it Newport Beach?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Newport Beach.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how long?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So, for how many years did you work in Mexico before-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico before I went there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For exactly... 15 years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;15 years. Okay. What jobs did you do here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here? In Mexico? Most of them in call centers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call centers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Call centers, like customer services representative. And I was like the other half of this time I was working here, I was working for bank institutions. Like for example, for wealth management companies and only wealth management companies... Like brokerage houses.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And banks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the financial area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you consider that you migrated to the United States when you went to... Newport Beach</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I attempted to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because that was my intention. When I went for... When I went to work in Newport Beach, it was from a company that was based here in Mexico, but also have offices in Irvine. So they introduced me to these new project in telecommunications and consulting in telecommunications and I.T. companies, and that was intention. But the thing is, that I found it kind of difficult to live there and I really felt like comfortable living there. So that&#39;s why I came back here to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay so, lets talk about that a little bit. Let me go through these silly questions, which don&#39;t really-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went with a visa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a migrant visa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It was a tourist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tourist visa you were on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. We can answer some of these. Did you know English when you went?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A </span><span>little&hellip;. </span><span class="c0">Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you went?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before yes, because in order to go there, I had to be fluent because it was a sales activity company. So, yeah I had to get relations with all the companies and look for a candidate to hire us, to provide our services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did your English improves when you were in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I think so, a lot. Definitely</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By... How?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the constant practice, because my job was to... As soon as I arrive at work, I had to contact all the companies as possible. You know? Like to dig in the right company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yes, it&#39;s very difficult. People sometimes they catch your accent immediately, and sometimes they are, a little bit close and you have to find a way to find the right accent to pass over them, and finally get an interview or a date for an appointment to demonstrate all of our services. It&#39;s very difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So having a Mexican </span><span>accent was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;difficult?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s what I think because... Yeah, sometimes it&#39;s my English is sort of a bit slower. And people... I just noticed that, when people in the USA want t</span><span>hey </span><span class="c3">information immediately, you want them... They want you to go straight to the point? And I know, find the glitch where you can start to selling. But yeah</span><span>, I mean</span><span class="c0">... Maybe that&#39;s why I think it was my difficulties. Those were my difficulties.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to talk a little bit about that. How old were you when you migrated? When you went to Newport Beach?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 34</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a second. So you lived in Newport Beach. Anywhere else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, just there. We stay there, our... We were renting an apartment very near from the office. So, sometimes we used to go outside and visit some other places in California or San Diego, but it was very limited.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t go to school there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You worked for nine months?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And that was sort of a sales job. Sales representatives?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sales representative.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the name of the company?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, </span><span>t</span><span class="c0">he name of the company was Link Consulting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Link. L-I-N-K, Link Consulting. My position was as a... I forgot the name of... Account manager, I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay. I&#39;m going to put account manager in sales.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that we know what it is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember how much you earned an hour? Or does it matter?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me see. I think it were like $300... $600 dollars a month and $20,000 pesos... I mean, $20,000 pesos. $600 dollars and $20,000 pesos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You earned $600 a month, </span><span>and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you were on commission?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Plus a commission, $600 a month. And the thing is that, I wasn&#39;t paying rent or meals or anything. Everything was included. So my base salary was at the $600 dollars and $20,000 pesos.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did you live with, when you were in the states?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With my bosses</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It was a small company. It was like the owner, the director, my boss, which was my... The director&#39;s husband. So we were a very small group so yeah. And another person, we were four living together. It was like a small project, and the thing is that they planned it to stay there for one year and the following years, they were going to expand in... Another office in Texas. But that&#39;s where I decided to stop working with them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you frightened of the U.S. authorities?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel... I always felt like, always being watched from some of them and not always but like two or three times I was... I hear two or three racist comments, that just made me feel like to avoid, to socialize with some other parties. And I guess, well, one part of my work was to assist, to networking appointments with some other persons doing... You know like meeting each other and know what they&#39;re selling, what you were selling and exchange, I don&#39;t know, activities, things like that. But, yeah, &nbsp;I never </span><span>felt comfortable</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;with joining them. I never feel like this welcome or that warmness, when you are speaking with someone or when you are trying to make business with someone else, because from someone from another country. I don&#39;t know</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it was difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you felt that they were... They discriminated against you? How did you feel? I</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">mean, that&#39;s an easy word, but can you put into words what you felt?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Like they wouldn&#39;t give me a chance to... For another... To escalate the interview. Like to get into the business. It&rsquo;s like I feel like the first image they get from you, maybe I wasn&#39;t that professional enough, but I don&#39;t know. I will describe it like... There was a lack of confidence. You know? I will say that, a lack of confidence</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that lack of confidence came from what, would you say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, maybe... I don&#39;t know if it was because of my accent. They knew that I wasn&#39;t from there. I know it because it was from... Of them and my social level. For example, I have to be very honest, I mean, I&#39;m very humble, but all these companies where I was working for, they were very wealthy. So all most likely all of the meetings that we were used to go, I don&#39;t know, maybe I was impressed or never interact with that wealthy people. I don&#39;t know. I was working with...Or in the other hand, I was sometimes, when I achieved an appointment or something, it was people from other countries. Like for example, there was this company, HCL that they were made of... Well they were only Indians. Is that right pronounce? Right? &nbsp;Indians from India. I think people from o</span><span>ther</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;countries were more open to hear your projects what you were trying to tell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I almost closed the deal with them, but they weren&#39;t American. I mean, </span><span>t</span><span class="c0">hey were Indians and that&#39;s what has been... That was because they were all of them scientifics. There were very, very people from big companies. For example, Panasonic Avionics, I don&#39;t know... I remember we were working with AT&amp;T in the [inaudible 00:12:30]. They were people very, very prepared in their fields. And sometimes when you are trying to get close to them and explain that you have a consulting company, that you can provide payroll, headhunting services, things like that. It&#39;s.... There are so much competence already. I thought that, it was something new, for me, and it was going to be easy. But now once you get there, you&#39;ll find out that there are thousands of companies that will provide exactly the same service of consulting, headhunting, payroll, that it&#39;s very difficult. The services are already there so... And most of them, they already had like friendships between companies. So they send consultants from one to another, they already know the people and it&#39;s difficult. When you&#39;re trying to get something new or something different from Mexico to them and well, I found it very difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were kind of providing human resources?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Human resources, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, was it the rat race, as we say it, that was difficult? Or was it the fact that everybody was already connected?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think everybody was already connected. Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, because they&#39;re racist... It was just like one or three times during all my staying there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go ahead.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s just like you say, everybody were linked already.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was saying the rat race. Do you know what the rat race is?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Oh, the rat race? Well, I hear something like that, but I don&#39;t know if its the same.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like everybody is competing with each other and running around. It&#39;s kind of an English... An American expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, Okay, okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s kind of </span><span class="c13 c3">un curso de rat&oacute;nes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;S</span><span>&iacute;</span><span class="c3">, s</span><span>&iacute;</span><span class="c3">, s</span><span>&iacute;</span><span class="c0">, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you sort of... Everybody is rushing around trying to compete with each other. Is that what it felt like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely. That&#39;s what I felt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So is that what you hated? Like why did... Let me go. Did you send money to relatives in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. How often?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like </span><span>e</span><span class="c0">very payday, I mean every 15 days.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And about how much each time, would you send?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every 15th of the month. Or the 15th or the 30th, I was sending 4,000 pesos... Well in dollars, like $200 dollars.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). So you lived there for nine months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). But what I kind of hate</span><span>d</span><span class="c3">, there is that, for example, in the beach, everything is very... The way we are used to go here in the beach, is more joyful. You can be with your friends, you can... We used to bring beers and sometimes you make, I don&#39;t know how you say&hellip; </span><span class="c3 c13">el asado.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barbecue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A barbecue, exactly. And I found a very controlled, there was no chance... If, you were drinking in the beaches, and there was for example, a penalty from the authorities. And that was my scare, was that to do something wrong or something that looks to be wrong and being deported. I want to keep my visa in case... In good terms. In case, I want to go away for vacations or maybe why not to go and find another job opportunity in the future. But I always have this paranoid, that I was going to do something wrong or something strange. That&#39;s why I didn&#39;t like it. To being there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Did you follow U.S. news when you were there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes... That was another, by the time it was there, there was a lot of news about the military were closing Walmart for no reason. And yes. And that, there was a lot of military movement back in those times that... Let me see if I remember, I believe there was a problem with... I don&#39;t remember very well. It was like a rumor and there was a moment that I thought, what if one day I cannot go back to Mexico for this problem is going to ignite a war right now here in the frontier. I don&#39;t know. But yeah, it was kind of scared.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the military you say, was sort of moving to the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yeah </span><span>w</span><span class="c0">ell, I don&#39;t know if maybe these were fake news because well I used to hear news from the TV and also news from YouTube.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But some of them, some of those news, &nbsp;sometimes I don&#39;t think they are a very confident source of information. But, the rumor was that there was, they were going to close the border and they were going to... They were closing Walmarts too, for some strange reason. I mean, you can think many things, for example, they were going to put a bunker, they were going to close people. I don&#39;t know. And two years later, I just find out that those places were used to keep the people, children, everybody who is trying to get into the U.S. illegally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re saying they would... It was rumors that they were going to close Walmart? Walmart the store?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there were two Walmarts that were closed when I was there, for no apparent reason. And the rumors were that they were going to use those facilities to keep persons like when the Nazi&#39;s... Do you remember? So I was like, okay, well that really didn&#39;t make me feel very peaceful. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What year was this, when you were there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What year were you in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was in 2015. 2015, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Did you follow Mexican news?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. No, when I was there, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m 38.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you made the decision to leave the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was offered to go to Texas, but by then, I just really didn&#39;t think that I was going to make it there. Not by myself. I feel kind of alone. In LA it&rsquo;s very multi-racial, I think that most like living with Americans. I was living with Chineses and Indians and from other places, but no, it was kind of difficult. For example, with the neighbors in the neighborhood I was telling you, it was a very wealthy neighborhood, so everybody was always in their houses, nobody outside. And I&#39;m very used to meet the neighbor, I go and you hanging around and, &quot;Hey show me your place, what do you recommend here.&quot; Things like that. But no, it wasn&#39;t... No very a-romantic I will say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it&#39;s hard to adjust to American culture.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. From my point of view, it was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it would have been different if you&#39;d gone as a young child, like so many people?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I think so. Probably... Well I have cousins. For example, my cousin still lives there. He went to live to U.S. since he was very young. He was like nine years and he still lives there. But he got all the tools necessary to complete his career as a pilot, as an airline pilot. And for several years, he was there. But as I met him, it was really easy to him. I think it would be... It will be also different for me, I guess. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, because you learn to live with people from all around the world, not specifically from the U.S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything you liked about it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). You don&#39;t have to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the thing is that I found many things... I still found them here so. Well, what I liked more was the parks. Like, for example, I know </span><span>Disneyland, </span><span class="c3">I know these, we went to Universal Studios. I really liked the traffic culture. I think it&#39;s very... It&#39;s well-designed. You don&#39;t have traffic. You can get... You have to go places very long distances, but it&#39;s... There&#39;s no traffic. You have high freeways. I think it&#39;s the organization is really well-planned, it</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c0">s what I really liked from them. But I think that behind this well organization, everyone is like very controlled. I don&#39;t know so, that&#39;s what I like.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. So how long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years. Almost three years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You live in Mexico city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re almost done. Who do you live with now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now I live with my mother.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s been very illness, that&#39;s lately, but it&#39;s something permanent so, I have to take care of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s wrong with her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She has... You know what epoc is? When you smoke too much and the lungs-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Emphysema.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she never smoked. It&#39;s something she has and she&#39;s young. It&#39;s from the lungs. So this is from the lungs... Well, she cannot go out from home. So she needs someone to be with her. And yes, I&#39;m right now, living with her, taking care... She is a stable, but yeah I&#39;m living with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she your partner before you went?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I just took... I used to leave by myself, but her health just went a little bit more difficult this last year... This last two years. So I think that I&#39;m going to be with her now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know of programs that support people who are migrants, that have come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you studied anything since you&#39;ve been back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve worked? Where do you work? What kinds of jobs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now, I work for a collections company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Collections agency. And they are dedicated to timeshares.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They are dedicated to work with timeshares.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeshares?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Timeshares and energy efficiency loans, and educational loans.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we&#39;re the service provider for many other companies, but since we collect on accounts that are past due, they consider us a collection agency.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That can&#39;t be much fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s not fun but to be very honest, I just realized that people from timeshares well, they have the money, they don&#39;t have inconvenienced pay. Maybe sometimes they are just... They need someone to remind them, or for some specific reason, they weren&#39;t able to make the payment on time. You just contact them and they are able to make the payments. Sometimes they don&#39;t but we&#39;re very flexible. So, I don&#39;t think it&#39;s difficult working in the collection agency in Mexico, I think that will be very difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So these are... This is like a U.S. company?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is a U.S. company, yes. They have their headquarters in Arizona.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still think that can&#39;t be much fun. How much are you being paid?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now? Like 15,000 a month.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been the victim of a violent crime?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, just a robbery one time. One or two times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it difficult to come back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit, yes because you have to start all over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I&#39;m going to read you some things and you tell me whether these were difficulties. Finding a job?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Other economic challenges?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), like for example, buy your own house, or your own car is kind of difficult. With a salary it&#39;s kind of difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Continuing your education?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m planning to start a new career in administration. But start my own business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Family separation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was hard?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Actually, back when I was coming here, my parents were starting to divorce. They have two years that they just got divorced. So, I don&#39;t know if this also was affecting more my mother&#39;s health, but I&#39;m pretty sure it was a factor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Creating a network of friends back here. Was that hard, when you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Language, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting to Mexican culture? Did you have difficulties coming back to Mexico and looking at things after you&#39;ve been in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Any discrimination because you&#39;d been in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. Sometimes when I go out with my friends from work, most of them, they are deported or they were in the U.S. but they don&#39;t like speak Spanish here in Mexico. I know they are very used to their language. So they... When I go outside, one or two times in the booth yeah I hear &quot;What they think they are, we&#39;re in Mexico. Why they don&#39;t speak Spanish.&quot; </span><span>[chuckles] </span><span class="c0">Things like that. One or two times.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have difficulties with the bureaucracy here, when you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Any sadness or depression?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Do you still have family living in the U.S.? Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re almost done.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My aunt still lives there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Are there any... Is she a U.S. citizen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has she come to visit you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nope. She never came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is she considering coming to live in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you currently follow U.S. news? Do you follow what&#39;s going on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the TV I have CNN and... No, I&#39;m sorry, I have Fox News.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox News?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fox News, not CNN.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are these people listening to Fox News?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Huh?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are all these people listening to Fox News?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s the only thing we have. CNN you have to pay for it, but I follow news from CNN and YouTube.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re getting all the horrible news. It&#39;s true, I mean, it&#39;s not all true, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but that&#39;s where I heard. That&#39;s why sometimes I look for something different or another... TV-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll return to the U.S. someday?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would like to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To visit, or to live?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the thing is, I would like to live there, but for my age, maybe I don&#39;t have that courage to go in there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And right now, even a little bit less since then with the new, with the current government, I think it&#39;s not going to be that easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;ll put unsure. And you&#39;d like to go to live for economic reasons?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For economic reasons, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Do you currently volunteer in anything? Do you need... Do any volunteer work in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not now, but... I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s the same, but I used to do the volunteering activities with religious groups.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that counts. What kind of things would you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, well, the last one I have... It was four years ago, but we used to go to Iztapalapa to very poor neighborhoods, to provide them religious education like Christian Catholic education. And provisions like for example, food, or tools, to do work with them. For example, with the small things, how to we teach them&hellip; Well, there were some people... Women in particular that were teaching them how to create clothes for example... Like handcrafts. Handcrafting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That&#39;s great. That&#39;s it. Is there anything you&#39;d like to say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Rafael:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, I mean have... I&#39;m kind of... I&#39;m intrigued about this atmosphere, it looks very different, very I don&#39;t know, it looks like a work, but it&#39;s not that work, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c6 c3"></span></p><div><p class="c2 c4"><span class="c3 c6"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c16"><tbody><tr class="c5"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2 c7"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7 c2"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
