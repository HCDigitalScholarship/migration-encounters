So this is Anne and I am interviewing Josh. I want to start just by thanking you for coming and talking to us. I know that your story may be painful to retell and I&#39;m sorry if it brings back bad memories. But it&#39;s a story that hopefully will be important to be heard. So thank you. And so let&#39;s start. I was not involved with your survey, so I don&#39;t know much about you. Maybe you can tell me about when you first came to the United States, why you went, how old you were, what your first impressions were. That sort of thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom went to United States first, but she went as an immigrant. Um, so basically, when she was pregnant she came to Mexico and had me. Then when I was like six months or maybe one year, I don&#39;t really remember, she took me back and that&#39;s where basically everything started. As far as I can remember, I didn&#39;t know anything. I didn&#39;t know Spanish or English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were a baby.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was on kindergarten and I just grew up now learning English, so...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think she went to the US for economic reasons or to escape violence? What do you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother was over there. See, he went because he had a fight with my dad, so he have to move with his friends. But apparently, his friends, Um, got deported, so he was left alone. So my mom, well, she wanted to go back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old is your brother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;32. He&#39;s 32 now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much older is he than you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably twice. I&#39;m 19 right now. We&#39;re both on the same day and the same month. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he&#39;s 13 years older than you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. 30 something. He doesn&#39;t like me to say his age because he thinks I&#39;m going to tell him old or something. So I&rsquo;m like, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you went over as a baby to join your brother and with your mother. And your father? Where was your father?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t meet my father until I was like 14.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where&#39;d you go? Which-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which city?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California, Long beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you, in the house before you went to school, were you mainly speaking Spanish?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t know Spanish. Um, like I said, they taught me English and the Spanish that I knew was because of my mom because she wanted me not to forget. So yeah. But I knew more English than Spanish at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So she speaks English as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A little. She preferred to speak Spanish because she was hanging with Mexican people over there. So yeah. She doesn&#39;t speak too much English, but she can understand it very well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what did she do while you were growing up? What was her job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Working. She was a maid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a maid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maid. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she working a lot?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, she probably rested one day. One day, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you went to school, you had already learned English by the time you got to kindergarten, first grade?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They were teaching me by levels. Yeah. Every time we had school, they separated me into a different classroom, so they can teach us better English to more advanced words and stuff like that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when do you think you became fluent?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, probably when I was in fifth grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fifth grade, that&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Sort of. Yeah. Because I could basically maintain a conversation with everything you asked. Right now, I probably cannot because the accent where I&rsquo;m from. The accent. I don&#39;t know. My accent doesn&#39;t-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You speak fluent to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So how did you like school in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was really great, really. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far did you go?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you finish high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Half. Half then I had to come back. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. 10th grade? Through 10th grade?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you like about school in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, they, I remember they had a basketball court, &nbsp;a football court, they had everything. They had toilet paper in the bathroom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The toilet paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Once you&rsquo;re, I mean, when you&#39;re there, those things you probably don&#39;t take notice, but once you&#39;re here and you&#39;re like, &quot;Where&#39;s the toilet paper?&quot; Or, &quot;Where&#39;s the water fountain?&quot; Yeah. That&#39;s when you&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, I miss it.&quot; Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s funny. Yeah. That&#39;s funny. Did you make lots of friends?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I met lots of people. Asians, also American, Mexicans too. Yeah. So I liked that a lot too, that there&#39;s different type of, you know, people around the world. So yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was home life like for you and your brother and your mom? Did you guys go out and do things? Did you go to the park?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, since my mom was taking care of kids when she was a maid, I used to go with her sometimes. Yeah. I went with her when I didn&#39;t have school, like vacations. But my brother, he was working every day. He was working on Denny&rsquo;s, I think. He slept in daytime and then nighttime he went to work. Yeah. So basically, that&#39;s what I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did he help support the family, your brother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, no. No. He was more like, my mom, actually, my mom supported him. So we were just there in case he needed something because... Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you enjoyed sports?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I like to play sports. I don&#39;t really watch them, but I like play them more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like football. American football and probably baseball. And basketball too. I like basketball. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you were in, college, I&rsquo;m sorry, high school, you said you got through 10th grade. Did you get in trouble or did you... How come that stopped? 10th grade. Why did you stop?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother got deported. Yeah. Because my brother, he was involved in something that he shouldn&#39;t have. I&#39;m not really sure because I was eight years or something. Eight years old. So I only heard my mom fighting with my brother on the phone. So basically, I think one day he was, like, driving drunk. So I think he crashed it and he got he deported, so my mom, let&rsquo;s go back. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got to deported when you were in high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I just got in a car and my mom was like, &quot;We have to go back because brother got deported, he can&#39;t be over there alone, so we got to go.&quot; Yeah. That&#39;s basically where it ended. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So tell me, were you the kid in high school, did you get in trouble?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got in trouble, yeah, a few times, but because I got into fights, you know, because, when I was like, you know, when there was a little bit of racism.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They&#39;re like, &quot;Go Mexican, go back to Mexico.&quot; Stuff like that. So I got a little mad and then when they pushed me, I pushed back and we got in trouble for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But nothing big.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing big. Yeah. Nothing big.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never in trouble with the law?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think my brother did though because he was telling me not to ever get involved with that. So I took it as his advice, my mom&#39;s advice. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were a good kid? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have friends that actually did fall for that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s great. Yeah. So did you have any girlfriends while you were in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Basically, since we rented. Yeah. So I met people right there. We had friends. So my mom sort of taught me like, &quot;Yeah. Why are you not girlfriends with her?&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;What is that?&quot; Yeah. So, yeah, that&#39;s how it started.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to leave?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Especially, because I didn&#39;t know very much the language. So, the schools, just&hellip; Over there, they have a wall then a piece of paper and then you write it down. You have 10 minutes to write everything down. Over here it&#39;s like, &quot;Okay. I&#39;m going to start reading. You just write.&quot; So everything was really different. Really different. Yeah. Like the piece of paper, the water fountain, the courts, we don&#39;t have that here, normally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have athletic facilities.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So it was a big change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No toilet paper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No toilet paper. My mom told me it was, &quot;Bring your paper.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Don&#39;t we have some over there?&quot; When I went to school, I was like, &quot;Oh. And now I see why she said it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it must&#39;ve been tough. You went to the US and had to learn English while you were going to school, and then you come back to Mexico and had to learn Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the funny thing is that I got more bullied here than over there. And the bullying was totally different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it different?</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because when I was over there, it was just like, &quot;Go back to Mexico,&quot; and stuff like that. That was, like the worst thing they could say. But there is also some other Mexicans that are like, &quot;Why would he say that?&quot; Or stuff like that. So that&#39;s the only thing, we push each other. That&#39;s all. When I came here, Um, I got beat up. First time they told me, &ldquo;</span><span class="c3">un tiro</span><span class="c1">.&rdquo; I don&#39;t know what that was. Honestly, I thought it was some game or something or food. And when they said, &quot;Okay. I&#39;ll meet you outside.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And four dudes ganged up on me and I got beat up. That was for one year, just&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Every day. So they wanted to transfer me. But they had some issues because not every school, uh, every other school was going to take me all the way to the beginning. Yeah. So that&#39;s different bullying, so I had to go. My dad, that&#39;s when my dad showed up because my brother got mad and was like, &quot;Why aren&#39;t you teaching him how to fight,&quot; and stuff like that. &quot;You&#39;re supposed to be a dad. You&#39;re supposed to teach them stuff like that.&quot; Because my dad is a boxer, stuff like that. So he basically taught me and to defend myself. So that&#39;s when I started to fight back and the bullying ended. They even called me my friends. Yeah. And also the... Um, how do you say that? When it&#39;s not really safe? Probably right here, it&#39;s pretty safe where I live. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where you lived is not safe?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Actually I was told over there because-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to say. What&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When my dad always, when my dad taught me, when he&#39;s showing me how to fight, not to be scared, not to be scared of death and stuff like that. So he said, &quot;If you ever get bullied again and I find out I&#39;m going to beat you. If you ever let somebody do this to you, I&#39;m going to beat you,&quot; and stuff like that. So that&#39;s how I got taught. One day I was coming back from school and a car just stopped in front of my bus and four people got out, Um, the last one had a gun, but the other dudes had hooks, had hooks. What I did was, the guy with the gun got next to me, so I acted and I just got the gun, but I pointed it at the one that had a hook because the one that got the gun, he ran away. He was like, &quot;I&#39;m out.&quot; And the one that had got a hook, he didn&#39;t hesitate and he just got me with the hook. So I had to move.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years ago. Yeah. This one got infected. This one got infected, so I had to open it again so I can take out the... I&#39;m not sure how you say. The yellow thing. That pus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The pus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You did that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I had to do that. Because if I showed my dad, he would&#39;ve probably gotten mad. Yeah. So yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Normally, people, when they see it they think I&#39;m emo or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t go to the hospital? You just did it yourself?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I did it myself because I was afraid of my dad and I didn&#39;t want my mom to get scared because I still had to go to school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your mom didn&#39;t know about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody knew. Only me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just wore long sleeves?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wore long sleeves. Right now, I&#39;m only just wearing them because it&#39;s really hot. I can&#39;t wear long sleeves now. I&#39;m going to die.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your mom and dad, they&#39;re not together?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, they&#39;re not together.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what does she think about what he teaches you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, she wants me to learn the good things because she knows I got beat up a lot and stuff. So she was like, &quot;Okay. I never wanted you to learn how to fight. Never wanted you to be aggressive. But I mean, I never thought even our, even our, Mexican people would do that to you, so you got to learn.&quot; Yeah. So that&#39;s how I learned how to fight sort of. But she&#39;s like, &quot;Okay. Just try to learn the good things, if he has any.&quot; That&#39;s what she said.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean from your dad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you have a child, when you have a little boy, are you going to teach him how to fight?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, I don&#39;t want to. I don&#39;t want to. But if I probably teach him, I&#39;m going to, Um, you known, tell him, &quot;Don&#39;t forget, and it doesn&#39;t matter how strong you are, there&#39;s always going to be someone stronger, so you got to watch out. And also, if somebody challenges you to a fight it&#39;s because they never felt a real punch, okay? So don&#39;t challenge nobody.&quot; If I teach him just to defend yourself. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s tough. So how&#39;s school been after you stopped getting bullied? It must be very different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was uh, at first, I was bullied a lot, but then my father like I said, he taught me how to fight and stuff like that. So my body a little bit got bulkier, you can say. Yeah. So I got into a lot of fights for that too because my nickname was Rocky because the gym was right next to the school, like five blocks away at most. And so my friends were like, &quot;Oh, he goes to the gym, he goes to the gym, oh careful.&quot; And everybody who was like, &quot;Aw, he&#39;s probably just faking it. I&#39;m going to fight him.&quot; And my dad was like, &quot;You say no, I&#39;m going to beat you up. So you got to say yes.&quot; And I got into at least 30 fights. 30 fights.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my goodness.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got expelled from that school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got expelled for fighting?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I got expelled for fighting. Because I always try to take the fight far away from school because I don&#39;t want to get involved. So eventually, they found out and like, &quot;Why are you fighting?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah. But they always told me they wanted to fight and stuff like that.&quot; They like, &quot;We don&#39;t care. If you fight you&#39;re out.&quot; So I went to three different schools because of that. Yeah. I told my dad, he was like, &quot;Okay. You&#39;re going to stop training now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far did you get in school? Did you graduate from high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. </span><span class="c3">Preparatoria</span><span class="c1">. Everything except university, basically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, so even though you kept getting expelled, you kept-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I kept trying to find a different school. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you like education?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, I like it, education, but, Um, I&#39;m not really good at it though. You know what I mean? I can, I was the type of kid that actually failed the exam sort of stuff. And when I got to the last exams, I passed those. And also basically, &quot;Here do these works.&quot; And I never did it. Or I did it sometimes, the ones I really knew. And, &quot;Okay. This is your last chance, here&#39;s your exam. If you don&#39;t get a eight or a nine, you&#39;re going to start all over again.&quot; That&#39;s when I passed it. That&#39;s my way of getting through school. But university it was like, &quot;Okay. If you fail the exam, you&#39;re going to have to pay 4,000 pesos for each one, and you have eight materials.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Aw.&quot; Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re not going to university?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. I don&#39;t think so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old are you? You&#39;re 19.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;19. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when did you graduate from high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was, let&#39;s see, 17. Around 17. Sort of yeah. Because that&#39;s when I started my first official job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what is your job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve been working in a call center ever since?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. My brother has been in call center for, like, 30 years. So he&#39;s kept on recommending me. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same one or does he move from one call center-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He moves. He moves.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how about you? How many have you been to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two. This is my second one right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you move?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um because it dep&mdash;when you, Um, let&#39;s see, when you&#39;re in a call center, they pay you 3000, yeah, for 15 days or something. And then another job comes and like, &quot;Hey, I like your calls. Would you mind working for me?&quot; And so that&#39;s where you start moving.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then they pay you more?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They pay you more. Right now I move from like 3000 with bonus, but right now it&#39;s 4,000 with 2,500 if I go early. So doing what I&#39;m supposed to do, you know, go early. So it did climb up very high.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But apparently right now, I&#39;m probably not going to be able to work because of my military service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you&#39;re going to start.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. I&#39;m going to start military service.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When&#39;s that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I already started. This is the six month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They even shaved me. I don&#39;t like it. Yeah. I don&#39;t like being bald because cops do look at me weird. They even arrest me sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have six months in the military and then that&#39;s it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I need another six months and then I&#39;m done.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you have to go train elsewhere? Or are you...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">Torre&oacute;n</span><span class="c1">. Yeah, it&rsquo;s like, from where I live, it&#39;s like two, three hours distance. Yeah. In car. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does everyone have to have military service in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s just out of luck. Just like black ball and white ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lottery.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lottery. Exactly. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh and you...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;White ball.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that bad luck?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I thought it was good luck. I was like, &quot;Yeah. White ball.&quot; And then like, &quot;Oh no, no, no, you shouldn&#39;t, you know. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get paid for it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, you have to do it for free. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get benefits afterwards? Does the government give you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, everything that&#39;s related to government, as in if I want to be a cop or work for the airport they ask for your military. If you had black ball then okay, you already have it. If you have white ball then need to check that you&#39;ve completed your military service. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it doesn&#39;t really help you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It helps you because, I mean, they show you how to use guns, I mean, if there&#39;s a war or something or issues then they call us in for backup. And also, they tell us to workout. So it actually helps us because there&#39;s some kids that are really chubby. So run and run, run and pushups.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you don&#39;t get, like, any benefits afterwards? The government doesn&#39;t say, &quot;Thank you for being in the military. We&#39;re going to give you 500 pesos a month for the rest of your life or health insurance.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, no. I think they only give you health insurance if you&#39;re a military. If you&rsquo;re, like, really joining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. So you&#39;re 19. Do you have a girlfriend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No because I work and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re working hard. And living with your mother?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your brother? Or is he-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He had a baby, so he moved in because he can&#39;t take care of the baby like the entire time because he works. And so my mom and I sometimes help him out now. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And is his partner, is she involved or no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She&#39;s involved, but she works, like, from 8:00 to 8:00 probably. And my brother is from 2:00 to 11:00. He comes back at 12:00. So they take turns. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow. Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old is the baby?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old&#39;s the baby? She is, uh, eight months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight months?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Eight months. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it fun to see-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s fun. I mean, I like them, but when they cry. Yeah. Because that baby, if you lay her down, she starts crying. You have to pick her up until she sleeps. So yeah. That&#39;s basically it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you lived in the US what were your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams. When I was small it was like basically to become an astronaut. Astronaut. And then as I grew up, I basically just wanted to be, like, a police officer and stuff like that. Yeah. Because, you know, the good guys get the bad guys.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you know that you were undocumented as you were growing up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My mom told me that I was undocumented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you left when you were about 15, you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, 12.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, 12.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;12, yeah 12.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you hadn&#39;t had a lot of the issues of driver&#39;s licenses or papers&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your dreams now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Um, basically, just to keep going. To see where I can, if I can grow as much as I can. I basically don&#39;t have a dream like as an astronaut or something like that, but yeah, it&#39;s really just as far as I go. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. So do you think living in the United States made you different than your friends here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because basically, the way that each people behave. So I personally think that Mexicans are a little bit more aggressive in some sort of way. So that&#39;s basically, like, over there it&#39;s a little bit more calm according to me. Where I live it felt like I was calm. So yeah. That&#39;s basically what helped me out, so I can be more calm here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you dream about having family and having a house and things like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would dream about having a family, but 90% of my exes already have kids, so I need to make better choices. Yeah. Because, Um, I don&#39;t want a kid right now. I feel like I&#39;m not going to be too responsible. So I want to have a kid when I&#39;m older. Um, but yeah. I&#39;m sort of probably wanting to have a family and a future. And a future. Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So we&#39;re telling these stories about people who grew up in the US and came back. Is there anything you want to share that you haven&#39;t shared thus far? We&#39;re about to end. So just if there&#39;s anything you want to say about whatever your experiences in either country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, basically, yeah, once you change countries that you&#39;ll appreciate everything that you had. Basically, because everything&#39;s so different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Well, thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Josh:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And-</span></p><div><p class="c5"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
