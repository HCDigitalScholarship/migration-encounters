I don&rsquo;t know. What else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you end up crossing the border or did you get a visa?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I actually used somebody else&#39;s papers, somebody else&#39;s documents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Mhm [affirmative]. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: So I basically...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: That&#39;s how you got over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. I didn&#39;t cross the border or anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Do you remember your first moments in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. I remember that this lady, the one that took me over there, she just told me to go to sleep so I wouldn&#39;t have to talk or anything. And I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; It wasn&#39;t hard for me to go to sleep, so I just fell asleep. And when I woke up, I was over there, everything was so different. So I was surprised... I don&#39;t know. I felt good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What was different?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I mean, you can see everything... It was just&hellip; the city was just more clean, or I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s just a lot of different stuff. The stores and buildings and everything was just different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. A lot of people mentioned the air or the smell, even, was different. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And where did you end up living when you moved to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I grew up in Georgia. Before that, when I crossed over there, I stayed in Houston for like two months. And then we also went to Florida for another like two months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And then Houston was where you put in your roots a bit. And what was it like growing up in Houston? Did you know you were undocumented?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I did know. I mean, pretty much I grew up in Georgia...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Oh, sorry, Georgia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: </span><span class="c6">At the beginning it was hard, going to school and not speaking English, everybody making fun of you, and it was hard. But then after a while you get used to it, and get the hang of it, started making friends and stuff.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you take ESL classes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What were those like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: They were boring.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: </span><span class="c6">But they were cool because we were all Hispanic people, so it felt good, than just being with a bunch of Americans. They didn&#39;t speak English that well, so it was better to be with our ESL team.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. More comfortable probably. Did you like school? Did you like any particular teachers, or not really for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Not really. Yeah, I didn&#39;t really like school, honestly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What did you like outside of school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I liked playing soccer, I liked playing soccer, but there&#39;s a lot of stuff going out there that gets your attention, all this partying and stuff. So yeah, I pretty much got into all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: How old were you when you got into all that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I was 14 when I started hanging out with those friends and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Were these friends just partying or were they also doing illegal activities?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, they were actually doing illegal activities, also. I got involved. I mean, I lived right there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Were these gangs or just casual groups?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Yeah, some of them. Well actually, a few of my cousins they were already involved in gangs, so it was pretty easy for me to get used to that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, slip into that lifestyle, I bet. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And that was when you were around 14 years old?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So did you stop playing soccer then, around there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Mm-hmm (affirmative). I stopped playing soccer, then I left school When I was 15 I dropped out of school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What grade was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: That was in eighth grade, middle school, the last grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did your parents have anything to say about that or were they not...?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: My mom she did not really say anything about that because I actually told her that I wanted to get a job because I was not doing good in school. So she was like, &quot;Okay, well, if you&#39;re going to do better by having a job, then just get a job. I&#39;ll help you get a job.&quot; Then she basically talked to one of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I started working when I was 15. It was at a carpet mill.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What did you do there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Big machines? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Were they dangerous?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, because they&#39;re cutting machines and...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did they know you were 15? Or did you have to say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">:</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;They didn&#39;t know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID. So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I mean they knew, but that&#39;s just how it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you make any friends at work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, I did have a lot of friends at work. Most of them just Hispanic people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Around your age, too?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: A few, like one or two that were my age. But I think I was the youngest one.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And this time you were also... Were you in the gang or just affiliated around it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, I was in the gang.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: In the gang as well? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my professor&#39;s interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the trends are. What was it in your case?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: </span><span class="c6">In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say? Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that&#39;s it.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, it&#39;s a pride thing. It&#39;s a pride thing. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it. That&#39;s on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You&#39;re also already by blood, as well. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. So you were working and also doing this when you weren&#39;t working. So you were doing both simultaneously?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: When I started working, I didn&#39;t get to hang around with them that much, that&rsquo;s when I didn&#39;t used to work, that&rsquo;s when I was in school. But there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend there would be someone there to pick me up and &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s go do this and that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What was this and that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Basically, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And that was from 15 years old to...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: To like 17, 18.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: To 17. And then what happened when you were 17 or 18?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Well, I kind of came down a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Why was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I got with a girl. She came to live with me. I dedicated more time to her. She didn&#39;t really let me go out that much because she knew what I was doing. Basically, it was for her that I came down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you have a child with her or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No. Well she got pregnant one time, something went wrong, and she lost it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Like a miscarriage?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. She had a miscarriage.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you want the baby?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, no I did want the baby. Yeah. It was messed up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: I&#39;m sorry. I know, that&#39;s difficult. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So then how old were you when you left the US, or how did you leave the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I was 22. I was 22. 21 or 22.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What led to you leaving the US? What happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Well, I got deported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Oh, you were deported? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What were the events leading up to deportation? What caused it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I was driving without a license.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, gang-related.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it, driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you treated? What happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal people, make you sign your deportation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn&#39;t provide me with any rights or anything. It was just like, &quot;You&#39;re going to sign this so you can get deported.&quot; Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county, also. I was 17 by then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Why were you arrested that time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took me to jail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were taken to jail at 17?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Okay. So then they had you in the system beforehand?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And then when you were arrested for driving without a license, they looked that up. You weren&#39;t given the chance to fight your case or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yes, I was, but I didn&#39;t want to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn&#39;t want to spend that much time in detention or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they&#39;d be fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after that, they&#39;d still get deported. So might as well just deport me right away. I don&#39;t want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you can just go and deport me anyways.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Right. Were you still like with your girlfriend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And your daughter?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: With what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Oh, sorry, you didn&#39;t have a child. I&#39;m sorry. [inaudible 00:12:22] sensitive. So you were still with your girlfriend at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And then, soon you&#39;re deported. Was that difficult to leave her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, it was. She used to tell me that she wanted to come down here with me, but I was like... I was struggling over here, and it was not easy. So, I told her, &quot;You know what? I don&#39;t think it&#39;s a good idea. Because things are different, and you&#39;re not going to like it, and I don&#39;t want to tell you, &#39;Yes, come on over here and we&#39;re going to be fine.&#39; And then what if you don&#39;t like it and then you get mad and you&#39;re going to be like, &#39;It&#39;s your fault I came over here.&#39;&quot; I didn&#39;t want none of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: It&#39;s a big risk. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Was she also undocumented?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, so if she came, she would have to probably stay as well. Could you tell me about, you said it was difficult reintegrating. Can you tell me a bit about your deportation? How you were deported and then what it was like being in Mexico, because again, it&#39;s almost like a new country. You spent so much time in the US. Just how is reintegrating into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Well, it is kind of difficult, because it was hard for me to get a job at first, because I didn&#39;t have any documents or any papers or anything. And my parents wouldn&#39;t help me, either because I was... I used to dress weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Weird?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. They always tell me I got a mean face. I don&#39;t know why, but everybody always tells me that. And since I used to dress baggy, they would look at me like&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Oh, thinking that you were becoming dangerous or something, or untrustworthy? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: Yeah, yeah.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Because we&#39;ve talked to a lot of people who have had similar experiences, were affiliated or part of gangs in the US and then were like, &quot;Okay, I want a second chance. I want to get the job here, do different things.&quot; And then maybe because of their tattoos and the way they present themselves, are then stereotyped as that way here, as well. So that was a bit of your experience?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So when you were reintegrating back, was it difficult? What were some of the biggest challenges finding a job, being separated from your girlfriend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Well, being separated from my mom, because actually I was over there with my mom and my mom&#39;s still over there. She&#39;s still living over there in Georgia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And you&#39;re close with your mom?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. We talk a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Do you talk a lot now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: By the phone, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Does she check in with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What do you talk about? Just anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, just how she&#39;s doing, how I&#39;m doing, how things are over here, how things are over there. Kids over there, my little brothers and sisters. How they&rsquo;re doing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So pretty much your whole family is back in the US. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And how long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Six years now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Six years. Do you feel like it&#39;s gotten easier since you first came here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: What&#39;s gotten better?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Well, I got a better job now and that&#39;s basically... I live on my own now, I can pay my own things. Then when I got here, I had to be moving around with my aunts and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: With your family members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: With my family members, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So you had a bit of a support system, or... A little bit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Did you get any help from any other organizations or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Do you feel like you were treated differently here because you lived in the US for some time? Or do you feel different than other people here? Or no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No. I don&#39;t feel different. I&#39;m from here you know. I mean what gets me kind of upset is like you know, like I&#39;ve seen people around here, some guys that I work with, they grew up in the US, and when they come here, they be like, &quot;Hey, where you from?&quot; They try to bring like the stuff from over there, over here. For example, I had some guys the other day come up to me and they&#39;re like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; Because they come with the... How can I say it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: When you&#39;re in a gang in the US, you come up to see another gang member, you&#39;re like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; And then you start all that stuff, you know. That upsets me kind of because we&#39;re in Mexico, and we&#39;re Mexican. </span><span class="c1">I seen some people here, they&#39;ll be like, &quot;Ah, Well, I&#39;m from Chicago, or I&#39;m from LA or...&quot; Like that. I&#39;m going to be like, &ldquo;well then why are you here if you were from Chicago or if you were from LA? Or whatever you say you&#39;re from, you wouldn&#39;t be here, you know&rdquo; I don&#39;t like saying that, because like I said, I do see people here that be like that. &quot;Well, I come from Chicago or I come from...&quot; </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c6">: Okay, you come from over there, you grew up over there. But I mean, you&#39;re not even from over there. You&#39;re from here. I mean, that&#39;s something that just I don&#39;t...</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: So do you feel like you&#39;re more in touch with your Mexican roots or identity here than some other people you know coming in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, yeah. I mean, if somebody comes up to me and be like, &quot;Where you from?&quot; I&#39;m not going to be like, &quot;Well I&#39;m from Georgia.&quot; No, I&#39;m from here. I was born here. I lived over there, but that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Some people will say like, &quot;Oh, well, you&#39;re either like too American to be Mexican or too Mexican to be American.&quot; What&#39;s your response to that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I don&#39;t think I have a response to that. I&#39;m just Mexican, that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: That&#39;s who I am. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Pretty much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: If you were in the US still, what do you think you&#39;d be doing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Working. Do you know what job you&#39;d want?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Well, you don&#39;t really have an option over there. You still illegal, so you got pretty much got to adapt to whatever there is. I don&#39;t mind. As long as I&#39;m working, as long as I have a job, it don&#39;t really matter.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Nice. And what are your plans for, now that you&#39;re in Mexico? What do you hope to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: I just want to keep working. I don&#39;t know. Just in the future, maybe get a house, have my Mom come over here. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah. Be with your mother. Nice. Well, is there anything else you&#39;d want people to know or experiences you should share?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No, I think that&#39;s about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own decision, you know, you&#39;re good. But when you get deported and you just get arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that. And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There&#39;s a lot of things that can happen to you and stuff. I&#39;m glad I made it. I&#39;m glad I&#39;m here now. I&#39;m glad I got a job. I&#39;m not into that much trouble anymore. I have my kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: And now you have a child here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: How old is your kid here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: He&#39;s two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Two. Are there any values or things that you feel like you want your kid to have, or what do you hope?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Yes, I do want my kid to- I want him to in the future, grow up, study as much as he can, get a career, be someone not like me. I want him to --That&#39;s why I only want one, so I can give him everything. I don&#39;t want any more kids. I mean, I&#39;m not going to be able to give him everything. Might as well just keep one and give him all that I can.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah, absolutely. Do you think you&#39;d ever want your kid to go to the US and visit your family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: Of course, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Do any education in the US, do everything here, or...?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: No. I mean, I think he can do it here. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s no need for you to go to US. You can be someone here. You can study here, you can make a career. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Pablo</span><span class="c1">: You don&#39;t necessarily need to go somewhere else. In the future, you never know if there would be an opportunity. I&#39;m not going to stop him from... I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a chance that in the future he decides that he wants to go over somewhere else or he wants... It just depends on him. I&#39;m just going to support him through whatever he wants to do. As long as it&#39;s something good, I&#39;m always going to just be there and support him.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c3">Isabel</span><span class="c1">: That&#39;s great. Yeah. That&#39;s what I wanted to hear from you, just your own personal experience, how you&#39;ve changed because of it. That&#39;s a good note to end on. </span></p><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref1" id="cmnt1">[a]</a><span class="c8 c9">Similar to others, experienced &quot;illegality&quot; by adapting to the language as a young child.</span></p></div><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref2" id="cmnt2">[b]</a><span class="c8 c9">Finding solidarity.</span></p></div><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref3" id="cmnt3">[c]</a><span class="c8 c9">Unlike Mizzy/Miguel, he constantly faced his illegality.</span></p></div><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref4" id="cmnt4">[d]</a><span class="c8 c9">Looking for solidarity</span></p></div><div class="c4"><p class="c7"><a href="#cmnt_ref5" id="cmnt5">[e]</a><span class="c8 c9">Pablo is stereotyped for his appearance not just because of his race in the US but also for his demeanor, style, etc in both the US and Mexico.
