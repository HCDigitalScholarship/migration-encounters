Hi, Florizel.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hi.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s so nice to have you here. I&#39;m Anne. I&#39;m here from Philadelphia. We are so thankful that you&#39;re here to tell us about your experiences as a returning migrant. I understand that it could be painful. I don&#39;t know your story, since I didn&#39;t listen to your survey. I&#39;m sorry if it is. I just think it&#39;s important for people to hear the stories of people who have been to the United States and left. So, anyway, as I said, I don&#39;t know anything about your story. How old were you when you went to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually eight months old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to ask you what it was like when you first got there, but I bet you don&#39;t remember.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t remember that. My mom actually, I guess by her job, she got a visa, so we actually went to the United States legally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did she do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her job? I actually don&#39;t know. I think she worked at a factory or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went with her and who else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just my mom. My dad, he was already over there. We actually went to California. We were in Long Beach, California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I&#39;m actually the oldest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see. I see. You&#39;re eight months old, and so you really probably grew up as an American. Is that true?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did your father do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad, he was actually working at a restaurant. There&#39;s this famous place in California called __________. He was actually working at ____________. That&#39;s what he was doing. My mom was just a stay-at-home mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get more siblings as you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually have one brother and two sisters.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like growing up? Were you in Long Beach the whole time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First of all, since I&#39;m the oldest, I kind of learned how to speak Spanish and English at the same time, so I was my mom&#39;s translator the whole time, since I was, that I remember, was six years old and she would tell me to translate when we would go to the bank, when she wanted to order something. I was actually her main help. My brothers and my sister were actually, they were born over there. They grew up speaking English instead of Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She only spoke Spanish?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, she speaks Spanish, but we&#39;d always talk to her in English, but she would always answer back in Spanish. My dad actually knows both languages, because we always speak to him in English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually attended, it&#39;s called _______ &nbsp;in Utah. We moved to Utah. Then I went to _________ and then ______ High School.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why did you move to Utah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad was actually, since California&#39;s a place where a lot of the people from Mexico go, so he was actually just getting into trouble and all that stuff. My mom needed a man to help out in the house, not a child. So, we decided since we&#39;re members of the Mormon church, we have some friends that lived in Utah, and they invited us to go over. We decided to stay there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your dad went with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he become a man?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He became a man. He became a father type. He was actually way different, because that I remember, when we used to live in California, he used to drink a lot. I don&#39;t know if he did any drug use, but he would always come home beaten up, all bloody, his knuckles all bloody, stabbed. When we moved to Utah, all that thing, all of it stopped. It was good to see that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Growing up in the United States, did you feel different than other kids or did you feel just like any American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually feel kinda different, because I grew up in violence in my house. All the friends that I had, American friends that I had, they never talked about any violence in their home or being mistreated or anything like that. I felt out of place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you talk about violence, what do you mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They would hit me if I didn&#39;t do my homework. If I didn&#39;t know my times table, they would hit me, just to learn. They thought that by hitting me, I will learn faster. That was hard. I was the only one that received that punishment, since I was the oldest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your younger siblings didn&#39;t get that punishment?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My brother did a little bit. The one in the middle, Wendy, she really didn&#39;t receive it, and the youngest really not at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seemed like a real difference.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was different, because growing up in the Mormon Church, you talk to your friends, and they all reunite and they have different kind of lifestyles than what I grew up with. Sometimes I would tell my parents, why couldn&#39;t I be like my friend Rachel. They&#39;d say, &quot;Cause you&rsquo;re not&hellip; First of all because we&#39;re Mexican, and their parents didn&#39;t show them how to ... &quot; They were just raised in different ways. It was kind of hard. It was really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were your parents Mormon before they came to the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They were actually Mormon.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there much of a Mormon church in ... Were you born in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Matamoros, over by the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a Mormon church that you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were actually Mormon. I have an aunt. She actually, I think she was Mormon her whole life. That&#39;s when they decided to join the Mormon Church. Then when we went to California, my parents, they know a lot of Mormons, they became friends with them. Until now, they&#39;re still friends with us. They&#39;re actually more family than my actual family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You went to elementary school you said in California and then middle and high in Utah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We actually moved a lot. I went to two different elementaries in California. Then when we stayed in Utah, then that&#39;s the only elementary that I went to was _______. Then from there I went to junior high, then high school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you moving a lot because of issues associated with being a migrant?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of. That&#39;s one of the problems. My parents were always afraid. I remember one time I was doing a report in school about immigrants. It gave me so much </span><span class="c3">information about how</span><span class="c3 c9">&nbsp;I can become a U.S. citizen. I told my dad, I told him the plan. I was like, &quot;Look, I was reading these books. I&#39;m actually doing a paper on it. I&#39;m thinking of becoming a citizen.&quot; He told me not to touch that subject, because if I did anything, they would come and deport all of us, just me and my mom and my dad. He told me just to leave it alone. Then when I was in front of a judge, he told </span><span class="c3">me</span><span class="c1">, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you become a citizen when you were 18?&quot; I told him I couldn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s really loud.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not because I didn&#39;t want to. It&#39;s because my parents didn&#39;t allow me to. They were easygoing with me in that situation when I was in court, because I was actually held for a month in the county jail by ICE.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I haven&#39;t got to that point yet, but we definitely will. We will. You graduate from high school, and you wanted to become a citizen, but your parents were worried that since they were illegal that you would bring attention to the rest of the family, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After high school did you go to work or did you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually worked. I worked at Wendy&#39;s for like three years. Then from there I had a problem with one of these two managers. Obviously, they were always on drugs. I think it was after Christmas. We were really busy. I think they were coming down on their drugs. I was just on my own, doing my own thing. Then they got upset and decided to fire me. My supervisor, my manager back then, I called her up. She was actually in vacation. I called her up and I told her what happened. She came back after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before this whole thing started, my parents always told me that I was born in California. They told me that I was born in Harbor City, California. I had a green card. I had a Social Security card, but I never knew it was fake. I was really confident with myself, going, getting into trouble and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I went to work, and my manager told me to come back. Then she said that I needed to take a form to the Social Security Department. Then I told my mom, I was like, &quot;Oh, can you come with me, so I can go and get this filled out?&quot; She said, &quot;No. Just leave it alone.&quot; She was like, &quot;Just get another job.&quot; I was like, &quot;I can&#39;t come back to work, because my parents won&#39;t allow me.&quot; So I insisted, I asked my mom, I was like, &quot;What happened? What&#39;s going on?&quot; Then she told me. She&#39;s like, &quot;You know what? It&#39;s because your Social Security, we&#39;re sharing it with someone else.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;We can&#39;t get that person in trouble.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right.&quot; I just left it alone. Then I got another job. They didn&#39;t question me or anything like that. Everything went through like normal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your mother tell you at that point that you had been born in Mexico and not in the U.S?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually found out when I was already detained by ICE, because ICE was like, &quot;Hey, you know what? You were born in Mexico.&quot; I was like, &quot;No. I wasn&#39;t born in Mexico.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I need you to call your mom.&quot; I called my mom. They already knew I was detained, because I had a warrant for my arrest.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got in trouble?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was hanging out with this girl and she stole some credit cards. She was 12 at the time. I was 18. I decided to take the fault for it. I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t want you to get in trouble by your parents,&quot; since her parents were celebrating their anniversary in Las Vegas. I was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll just take the fall. It&#39;s really no big deal.&quot; Then my parents knew that I was arrested. I called my mom and I was like, &quot;Okay, mom.&quot; She was like, &quot;Immigration&#39;s got you.&quot; I was like, &quot;How do you know?&quot; She was like, &quot;You were born in Mexico. You&#39;re not born in California.&quot; I was like, &quot;What the heck? Why would you lie to me this whole time?&quot; I asked her about the green card. She was like, &quot;It&#39;s all fake.&quot; I was like, &quot;It has the holographic stamp on the back of the green cards. How the heck do you guys do that?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;You know what? You need to cooperate with them.&quot; Immigration was really hard with me though. They wanted-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that when you got detained or deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually volunteered to come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were 18?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I turned 19 by then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you&#39;d been working for Wendy&#39;s, but that was through high school you were working?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually moved a lot. My first job was, it&#39;s called _____. It was a survey company. We would call people, asking if they wanted to take a survey. Then I worked for Wendy&#39;s for three years. Then from there I went to ______. It&#39;s this Mexican restaurant. Then from there I went to this other, it was called ________, also a survey company. Then from there I just worked with my dad. He works construction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were working through high school with this fake green card?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were young when you got detained. You were young. You were 18. You must&#39;ve been in shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really shocking for me. I was actually really confident that my dad was going to bail me out. Then when three weeks passed by, two weeks, and I was like, &quot;What the heck? Why am I still here?&quot; I would call my mom. I was like, &quot;Mom.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;re going to come get you anytime. Don&#39;t worry. Just hang there.&quot; I would hear deputies come in and get all the inmates that were going home. Then I would ask them, I was like, &quot;What about me?&quot; Immigration didn&#39;t want me to leave the jail yet, because what they wanted was me and my mom&#39;s visa. They wanted all proof how it got into the United States. They would call me at 4:00 in the morning. They would call me at noon. One time they actually, they took me over to, it was the immigration center. They left me in the cell for almost the whole day without water, without food. It was really cold. Then I would ask them, I was like, &quot;Hey, but I didn&#39;t do anything.&quot; Then they would just tell me to shut up </span><span class="c3">freaking</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;Mexican. They were really rude.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically you were with a 12-year-old girl who was selling credit cards. You took the fall. They immediately said you&#39;re illegal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing here that happened is that we were at Target, and the card wouldn&#39;t go through. Since I was a cashier back then in Wendy&#39;s, I was a cashier, I told her that if you put a bag over the card and slide it, it will go through. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes it&#39;s the metallic thing that isn&rsquo;t working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did it. Then that&#39;s when the camera, when they told me, when I went to court, they said that the camera caught me swiping the card. I told them, &quot;You know what? Yeah, I did it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a stolen card?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a stolen card. I really thought it was her mom&#39;s card, but it was a stolen card. She didn&#39;t really never told me that she had a stolen card. I just swiped it. It was no big deal. She signed for it and everything like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then did they just catch you immediately?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They actually went to my job. I remember I think I was working cashier. Then they told me, they&#39;re like, &quot;I need you to come down to the police station,&quot; and like, &quot;You have to follow the cop.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; They took me to the room. They were like, &quot;Okay.&quot; They told me about the charges. They wanted to charge me as a pedophile also, because we were looking at clothes and then I slapped her butt. They thought that I was doing something else, so they wanted to charge me as a pedophile, until they talked to her mom. Me and her mom got really well along, so they dropped the charges. They told them that it was just play. They wanted to charge me with a lot of things. They even charged me with distributing alcohol to a minor when I was 18. I couldn&#39;t even get alcohol. It was just so many things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Trumped up. Where did they take you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After when?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When they detained you, or where were you detained?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With immigration?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took me first to the _________. That&#39;s when I guess Obama&#39;s law was that all the county jails were going to be ICE holding jails. I remember that they separated all the Mexicans from the whites. I was with the white people. I wasn&#39;t with the Mexicans. That was just weird.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You weren&#39;t with Mexicans?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t with Mexicans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the whites criminals?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they were.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mexicans were illegals?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative), the illegals. I guess they didn&#39;t have anymore room. There were just more older women, probably in their 40s, 50s, grandmas.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long were you there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in for a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It would just be just like a girls camp, but with older women and druggies and pedophiles.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you say a girls camp, what do you mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a room filled with 10 bunk beds. Then you share a bathroom, just toilets. Then you share one shower. What else? They would wake us up at 5:00 in the morning to do a head count. Then from there we would have to wait until 7:00 to get our breakfast. Then from breakfast we would do the cleaning. After the cleaning, we would have a deputy come in with her gloves and check places that you wouldn&#39;t even think to clean. Then they would just make a mess and make us clean it all over again. We&#39;d be outside at the courtyard. We would be walking. Sometimes we would be reading, watching TV. Obviously we couldn&#39;t watch the news. What else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You couldn&#39;t watch the news?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because I guess there was this ... The reason why we couldn&#39;t watch the news is because you&#39;ll know who&#39;s going to be coming in sometimes or who got detained or what&#39;s going on in the world, I guess. We got to a point where we did watch one of the news, and we saw this lady that I guess she ... What did she do? I think she was babysitting a kid, a baby, and she shook it, because it wouldn&#39;t shut up, and I guess it died. She went in, into that jail where we were at, and she actually got beat up by all the inmates. Obviously, I didn&#39;t do anything to her. Sometimes when pedophiles would go in there too, they would just treat them like ... They would beat them up and stuff like that. It&#39;s traumatizing to see why people are there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was this lady I remember. She was fine. She would talk to you. She&#39;d walk around with you. Then suddenly she would be like, &quot;Oh, everything&#39;s burning down. There&#39;s blood all over the walls.&quot; They&#39;re just like, &quot;What the heck? What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; I guess she saw at the moment when her son lit his room on fire, and the moment that she walked in, her son shot himself. That&#39;s what she saw, blood all over. She would relive that. They would tease her. They would hit her. They would take her to the, it&#39;s called the hole. It&#39;s a miniature cell. They would just keep her there. They were cruel to the people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That seems pretty cruel. Did you have someone representing you? Did you have a lawyer?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My dad actually hired a lawyer. What he told me was that the process that my dad wanted to do is to keep me in jail, but keeping me in jail, I was going to become a U.S. citizen when I got out. I was going to do time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that it was April 2010. The judge, he told me, he&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, we&#39;re going to have the next court date, but it&#39;s going to be until June.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, but it&#39;s April. I don&#39;t want to be there for another month, two months.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Then I told the judge, I was like, &quot;If I may,&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;It&#39;s been really great being here in the United States. I&#39;ve done so many things. I&#39;ve visited so many places.&quot; I was like, &quot;I think it&#39;s time for me to move on. I don&#39;t want to be locked up. We&#39;re talking about my freedom.&quot; I told him that, &quot;I would like to go to Mexico, because I don&#39;t find any future here in the United States.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the lawyer was like, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s not what your dad had planned for you.&quot; I told him, &quot;I&#39;m really done following my dad&#39;s rules. I really don&#39;t want to follow his rules anymore. I&#39;ve been in situations in my family that aren&#39;t pleasant, so I decide that I wanted to move on by myself.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The judge, he said that there was a lot of good things about me that I&#39;ve done in the United States, and he respected the decision that I&#39;d made, and if that&#39;s what I really wanted, he&#39;ll go ahead and grant it. He still told me, he&#39;s like, &quot;Are you sure?&quot; I said, &quot;Yes. I really don&#39;t want to be here no more.&quot; He said, &quot;Okay. You leave tomorrow.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put you on a plane?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually went on a plane. They actually kept me separated from all the inmates. They had me, not in first-class, but they were all in the back and I was just there. It was a long process to get deported, because first of all, they would wake you up at 4:00 in the morning. You would have to get dressed, but you&#39;re handcuffed from ankles and your wrists. Then they took us to Salt Lake City. We were in the cell since 6:00 in the morning to 10:00. Then we went to Salt Lake City, where we were in another cell with 60 other people. We were just all cramped up. Then from there I remember that we left around 2:00. We arrived in Arizona. Then we went to Las Vegas. Then from Las Vegas, we went to Texas. Then from Texas, we took a bus to the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were flying these other-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Picking up more inmates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you took a bus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we took a bus, all of us took a bus. They already had my backpack. My parents had sent me a backpack with, it was like my personal stuff. Then they took off the handcuffs and they told us where to walk. I remember when I was walking, I was crossing the border, I had to go to the bathroom. I went to the bathroom. Then this girl came after me, and she&#39;s like, &quot;You know what? Give me all your stuff. I know you have money.&quot; She was already in the same plane that I was. She said that she needed all of it. I just looked at her like, &quot;What the heck? You were riding with me. We were in the same jail, in the same cell. Why are you taking my stuff away?&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I know your dad gave you money.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I need everything right now.&quot; The first thing I did is I pushed her into a stall, I closed it, and then I just ran off. I just ran.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a Virgin Mobile at that time. I topped it up really quick with my ... I had a top-up card. I topped it up. Then I called my dad. I was like, &quot;Dad, you know what? There&#39;s this girl after me.&quot; Then I was kind of keeping it calm. My dad was keeping it calm. My mom was all screaming and stuff. Then he told me, he&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, so your aunt&#39;s going to meet, she&#39;s going to be meeting you there. I need you to call her.&quot; I called her and I told her, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m already here.&quot; She said, &quot;Okay, if you walk, if you look at this ... &quot; She told me the instructions. She&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re going to see a fountain.&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m already at the fountain.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll be there in 10 minutes.&quot; When she arrived, actually there was two girls, two ladies. They came up to me and she&#39;s like, &quot;What do you need?&quot; They were like, &quot;We&#39;re going to go with her to the hotel.&quot; My aunt&#39;s like, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m just here to help out my niece. I can&#39;t help you guys out.&quot; She took me. She took me to a, I don&#39;t know if it was a two-star hotel, motel, but it was just horrible, but it was better than being in a cell. Then what else?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your parents, they were still illegal?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my parents were still illegal. My mom actually became a citizen two years ago. My dad&#39;s still illegal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that was one of the reasons why they couldn&#39;t help you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He hired a lawyer, but he couldn&#39;t do a whole lot more, I would imagine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember my dad said, I guess they were asking for $10,000 in bail. He had the money. The only thing here is that they needed to sign off, like needing a cosigner. They asked my uncle for help, and he denied it. All my dad&#39;s family denied help. I didn&#39;t receive any help from them at all. They basically disowned me from the family. The most help that I&#39;ve gotten is from my mom&#39;s side of the family, which they are actually here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it because they were illegal too or do you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, all of my dad&#39;s family are legal, because of one of my uncles. The only thing here is that they don&#39;t want to help my dad. I don&#39;t know why. I guess my dad&#39;s in the process of fixing his papers, but it takes time. It&#39;s been, what, nine years that I haven&#39;t seen my dad. I haven&#39;t seen my brother, but I&#39;ve seen my two other sisters and my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve been here for nine years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You walk over the border. You&#39;re trying to escape these people who are trying to steal all your stuff. You meet your aunt. Is she going to bring you home or she just put you up at the hotel and then left?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She lives in Texas. I think it&#39;s really 30 minutes away from the border. Her job was to put me somewhere safe, until the next day she took me to the bus station for me to come to Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like when you walked over the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really embarrassing. There are so many people there, just waiting to cross the border, to get to the other side. They know what&#39;s going on. I&#39;m walking across the border. You look over to your left or to your right. Then there&#39;s just people staring at you like if you&#39;re just some kind of criminal, like you&#39;re a piece of crap, just like you&#39;re not worth it. It&#39;s embarrassing, because they humiliate you. In my head I was just like, &quot;Walk faster. Walk faster. Don&#39;t make any eye contact with anybody.&quot; The U.S. guards are actually walking you out with guns, rifles. What are you going to do? If I want to cross back, are you going to shoot me, or what are you going to do? It&#39;s just really humiliating for someone to walk over the border, across the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you scared?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was scared, because I don&#39;t know the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You must&#39;ve been having second thoughts, like, &quot;Why did I decide to do this?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was actually having second thoughts. I was like, &quot;I should&#39;ve just stayed. I should&#39;ve just listened to my dad&#39;s lawyer. My dad always says everything for a reason, but here I am.&quot; Then I was like, &quot;Okay, okay, just stop playing mind games. Just go with it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When your aunt helped you get to Mexico City, was there anyone in Mexico City that greeted you or helped you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Actually my aunt went to pick me up, my mom&#39;s oldest sister. She went to pick me up at the bus station. She received me. She hugged me. She told me everything&#39;s going to be okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you live with her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you live with her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually lived with her for a week. My parents actually helped out her son, both of her sons, when they went to the United States. My cousin Alex, he said why can&#39;t I go live with them? I told him, I was like, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s fine. I&#39;ll go live with you.&quot; He felt like he needed to help me out, because he got help from us. That didn&#39;t go so well. I guess at that time that I arrived, his mother-in-law arrived, and she&#39;s from Chile. They&#39;re just different type kind of people. I guess she was looking at what I was doing the whole time. I guess there&#39;s some stuff that she didn&#39;t approve. She was the one that got me kicked out of his house. When they kicked me out of his house, my dad sent me to Cancun, supposedly for a better opportunity, which they&#39;re actually a little bit more racist than here in Mexico City, because basically Cancun is just a place that there&#39;s a lot of tourism. I&#39;ve always been a heavy girl. They wouldn&#39;t allow me to work at their hotels because I was heavy or because they needed a really skinny girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to say you&#39;re so beautiful, they should be-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually would always compare myself to the other girls. The only thing that the other girls would have is just their image, not their face, because they were ugly, but they didn&#39;t know any English. Their English was all really, really choppy. I actually worked there as a teacher at a daycare. I was actually giving English lessons. At the first daycare that I worked at, the two teachers were ... Actually, one of the teachers was actually really, really rude to me. She would call me names. She would tell me that I was stupid, that I didn&#39;t know how to work. Her sister, which she was actually the owner of the daycare, she would always give me tips of how to do my job right. She would always congratulate me for everything that I&#39;ve done. The other one was just-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe she was jealous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess so. They would always have me work 10-hour shifts. Sometimes supposedly the daycare would close at 8:00, and I would leave around 12:00, 1:00 in the morning, and then walk to my house. It was just really hard working with them. I decided to go to a different daycare where I was actually wanted. That was actually really fun. It was really fun. I had so much fun working at that place. I learned a lot of things. I actually learned how to domain Spanish, because I really didn&#39;t know Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to ask you, how was your Spanish when you got back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3 c9">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My Spanish was really choppy, really, really bad. I remember when I first went to the store, I was like, &quot;Can I get a Gatorade?&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;What?&quot; My aunt&#39;s like, &quot;What do you need?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;A Gatorade.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;</span><span class="c3 c7">Gatorade</span><span class="c1">.&quot; I was like, &quot;What? How do you say it?&quot; That was actually one of my first goals is to domain both languages. I can speak really perfect Spanish and really perfect English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did that take you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That took me three years for the Spanish. It was really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;d had some. You&#39;d been your mother&#39;s translator for a while back when you were little, so there must&#39;ve been some.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing here is that it&#39;s not just learning Spanish or what I learned with my parents. Sometimes my mom will text me in Spanish. I&#39;m just like, &quot;Dude, your spelling is so bad. Everything&#39;s just so bad, your verbs and your everything.&quot; I have a sister that went to Ecuador for a mission. She&#39;ll text me in Spanish, and I&#39;ll be like, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s not how you spell it.&quot; Sometimes I&#39;ll correct them, or when they say something, they don&#39;t pronounce it right in Spanish, and that&#39;s when I come in and, &quot;This is how you say it,&quot; or I&#39;ll use big words, and my mom&#39;s like, &quot;What did you just say?&quot; I was like, &quot;I said this.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;When did you learn that word?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Mom, it&#39;s just you pick it up or you have to study, because it ... &quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being in Mexico, I was actually living in _____, Guanajuato. That place is actually, it&#39;s not that open-minded as here in Mexico City, because I actually worked at TeleTech in Leon, so when people would hear us speak English, they would always either throw stuff at us or I&#39;ve had situations where we&#39;ve actually been choked or we&#39;ve been thrown off the bus, or one time we went to a soccer game, and we were just cheering, cheering in English, and then suddenly these people working at a fabric came out, a factory. They came out and they started saying stuff to us, like bad words, &quot;Go back to your country.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, I am in my country. You&#39;re saying this and you&#39;re working at a low place? Come on. At least I&#39;m making more money than you are.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve actually been to clubs where one time I remember that we were like, first of all we were getting pushed around. I thought it was just play, they were just playing or they were just dancing and they didn&#39;t see what was going on. I remember that someone just went up to me and just poured their drink on me. I was like, &quot;Okay, what the heck?&quot; Then they pushed my friend. She fell. Then they still stepped on her again. We&#39;re like, &quot;Okay, let&#39;s just go. We don&#39;t want any trouble.&quot; We decided to leave the club. At the moment that we actually were leaving, they started breaking all the windows from our cars that we had. My friends, they got out and they were like, &quot;Okay, what&#39;s going on?&quot; They came after the girls also. It just created this big chaos, this fight in between everybody. They were just saying to go back to our countries, that we don&#39;t belong here. I was just like, &quot;Why? Why are you treating us this way?&quot; My friend was actually screaming that to them, like, &quot;Why are you treating us this way? We&#39;re not different from any of you guys. You guys might probably be rich or whatever,&quot; because they were those preppy kids, But we&#39;re not any different.&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;We don&#39;t need your time here in Mexico.&quot; It&#39;s just like, &quot;Okay, whatever.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico City, you don&#39;t really receive that type of people. I just try not to speak English when I&#39;m outside of work or outside of home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just try to keep it natural, to avoid that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After you were at the daycare centers, what did you do for work? You said you really enjoyed the second one, where they welcomed you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually working with kids. They were actually one year to two years old, and I was doing the potty training. I would sing to them in English. I would like, &quot;Where&#39;s your nose?&quot; Teach them where&#39;s your nose, where&#39;s your eyes, head, shoulders, knees, and toes, and all that stuff. That&#39;s what I would do. After that, since I got really good along with their moms, they would ask me to babysit. That&#39;s what I would do. I would just babysit or we would have lots of homework. We would have to prepare for next day&#39;s activity. That&#39;s basically what I would do in my free time, or I would wash clothes or make food and that&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How&#39;d you get back here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After Cancun, it was the worst experience of my life, I met this girl. She was actually really good friends. She was working there at the daycare. She was actually from Leon.. She told me, &quot;Hey, I&#39;m actually going back, and I have a cousin that works at TeleTech. Do you want to come, to better your life, since you hate it here?&quot; I told her, &quot;Yeah, I want to go.&quot; I decided to move in with her and her family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then from there, I just started&hellip; it was just too much stuff. I guess this whole thing, being away from your family affects you, so I started drug abuse. I wanted to get away from that stuff. There was this one point that I got to, I was actually overdosing on crystal meth. I said to myself, &quot;You know what? This isn&#39;t your life. This is not you. What&#39;s going on? You need to go back on the same path that you were on.&quot; I decided to&hellip; I &nbsp;was actually talking it over with myself, going back to Mexico City, where there&#39;s family there, I have people that love me there, that would support me. I decided to take a trip here. I think it was July. That was four years ago. I came to visit one of my cousins. I saw how all my family, when they saw me, they wanted me here. I decided, I was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m going to stay, because I don&#39;t have anything else to do in Leon.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when I came and stayed here in Mexico City and decided to better myself, because the person that I was becoming, it wasn&#39;t me. I was influenced by other people, and I was following their types of activities. I decided to come here and just work hard. Now I have a house. I have a house in Cuernavaca with a pool. I&#39;m in the process of getting another house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you doing to make money to buy houses?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The thing here is that I&#39;m actually married. I&#39;m actually married to a girl. She&#39;s actually a federal cop, a federal agent or whatever. Both of us, that&#39;s how we combine our money to help us out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still work at a call center or no?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, no, I don&#39;t. First of all, I&#39;m living with my mother-in-law and her other daughter and her two kids. They&#39;re actually growing up. They&#39;re teenagers. They&#39;re going through a phase that is just not cool. I decided, I told Fernanda, that&#39;s my wife&#39;s name, I told her that I decided to, since we have a house in Cuernavaca we should just move there. Why leave the house alone? I told her I can do work at home jobs. There&#39;s actually two jobs. I think one of them&#39;s working for a company called Porch and the other one&#39;s Healing Quality. They&#39;re both different things. They do want bilinguals. That&#39;s my plan, to move down there. I actually recently just quit my job a week ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was doing what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was actually doing reservations for members that wanted to go to Cancun, Mazatlan, and all that stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a Club Med or something?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever heard of Westgate Cruise and Travel?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to give up the drugs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really hard, because I was actually hooked on it for two years. I&#39;d met Fernanda, and she was actually going through a phase that she was an alcoholic and I was a drug user. I remember I said to myself, &quot;If I ever find someone that really wants to be with me and cares for who I am, I&#39;ll go ahead and leave all that stuff.&quot; It was really hard, because I left it right away. I went through withdrawals. It was really hard. I actually gained weight, because I was really skinny, but then I gained it all. I feel good about myself right now. I&#39;m healthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re healthy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m healthy and I&#39;m happy. I don&#39;t have those cravings anymore. I don&#39;t want to do anything like that, person that I was before. You go through so many things that-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s right.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You try to find the way out, but then it&#39;s not the way out, so you&#39;re just getting deeper into that hole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Wow. It sounds like though that you have a good future ahead of you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s why I&#39;m keeping it positive. I really am. I really want to do good things in my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your goals, do you think?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now my goal is, by the end of this month, I&#39;ll be moving to Cuernavaca. I already have-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far away is that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s an hour and 20 minutes away. It&#39;s really beautiful. What else? One of my goals, first of all, I&#39;m actually looking into getting another house. The house in Cuernavaca, that&#39;s Fernanda&#39;s, that&#39;s hers. Mine, I&#39;ll probably be getting it in Hidalgo, which is another hour away. That house, I want to give it to my mom. I&#39;m just going to, whenever I have a house. I&rsquo;ve already, I asked the guy -- I&#39;m actually working with this real estate agent. I told him the situation. I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, you know what? I&#39;m not working right now, but I still want to make use of the points that I have,&quot; because I guess whenever you work here in Mexico, you accumulate points, and those points, you can use it towards your house. I told him, &quot;Hey, you know what? I&#39;m not working. Can I still use those points?&quot; He said, &quot;Yes. I actually have a house available in Hidalgo.&quot; Then that&#39;s when I&#39;m still in the process of communicating with him, so I can go ahead and see the house. Hopefully I can get a house. Once I have that, I&#39;m going to give that to my mom, &quot;Here&#39;s your house.&quot; It&#39;s going to be her vacation house. She&#39;s going to have somewhere.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s a citizen now, so she can come back and forth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She can come back and forth. She actually came for my birthday. My birthday was back on the ___. I remember I got off work, and my wife went to pick me up. It was dark, so I couldn&#39;t really see. Then my wife&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, someone&#39;s in the back for you.&quot; I just looked over, and my mom was like, &quot;Hey, surprise.&quot; I was like, &quot;Dude, you just really came for my birthday?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She made this huge party. It was just really great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing. That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was something. I told my little sister, I was like, &quot;Wow. Now I know who she loves the most.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; My mom does a lot of things to, to make us happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s nice. Do you think that you experience discrimination because you&#39;re married to a woman?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what? I&#39;ve actually never experienced that type of discrimination. I&#39;ve experienced that type of discrimination, but on my dad&#39;s side of the family. My mom&#39;s side of the family, they&#39;re always accepting. They love her. In society, it&#39;s really normal. They don&#39;t really say much about it. Besides, we&#39;re more private about it. If you see us down the street or whatever, we&#39;re just going to be like normal. Sometimes they ask us if we&#39;re sisters. We&#39;re just like, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re sisters.&quot; &quot;Are you guys cousins? Because you guys look alike.&quot; &quot;Oh yeah, we are.&quot; We just play along. We try to keep away from ... That&#39;s not anybody else&#39;s business.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. When you think back about your time in the U.S, you grew up in the U.S. It was really your home. Are there things that you think about the United States that make you different or growing up there that made you different than your wife, who didn&#39;t grow up there, or other people that are your friends who grew up in Mexico? Is there something about the U.S. that made you different?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. There&#39;s actually a lot of things that ... For example, my house right now, I&#39;m really used to just shopping at Costco, getting everything at Costco. That&#39;s something that I&#39;ve actually brought into the house. My mother-in-law likes it, because first of all, we save money, a month. The types of food that I&#39;m used to eating, I&#39;m not really used to eating the whole Mexican food. It&#39;s really not my type of food that I like. Sometimes they get mad because I&#39;ll leave the living room TV on in English and they get mad about that, or the type of music that I listen to, nobody really wants to listen to it because it&#39;s English. Just the way I think, the way I manage stuff, they do it differently.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, when you&#39;re in a group of people, and you walk in, and you know how sometimes we&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up? Hi.&quot; Sorry. Sometimes I just walk in. I say hi to everybody. Oh my gosh, hang on. I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You okay?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My throat gets really dry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dry, yeah. Especially here, it&#39;s dry. It was raining.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They see bad, not well educated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you&#39;re not-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I don&#39;t say hi to every single person. I just do this, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up?&quot; That&#39;s not proper here in Mexico. What else? Sometimes their parenting is just really funny. I&#39;ll be like, &quot;Hey, my parents didn&#39;t do that,&quot; or, &quot;My friends&#39; parents would do this.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;re not in America.&quot; Sometimes I&#39;ll tell my girl, I&#39;m like, &quot;Hey, we should go to IHOP.&quot; She&#39;ll be like, &quot;It&#39;s an American place.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, I like IHOP.&quot; What else? She&#39;s getting used to the whole sometimes American stuff that my mom brings us. She&#39;ll be like, &quot;Oh, this is different, but it&#39;s whatever.&quot; I&#39;m just like, &quot;How do you say that? It&#39;s really good.&quot; I actually told my mother-in-law, I&#39;m like, &quot;I want to take you for Mother&#39;s Day to Chili&#39;s.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;d rather eat somewhere else. I don&#39;t like American places.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mother-in-law?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m just like, &quot;Dude, come on.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Anything that you think back on in the United States that you really are glad you don&#39;t have to experience that anymore?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No offense, but the whole Trump thing. I wouldn&#39;t want to be in that situation right now. I wouldn&#39;t want to be like the DREAMers. I&#39;d just rather be here, dealing with our president.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were a DREAMer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right? Aren&#39;t you a DREAMer? People who-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I guess, but not right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but if you were you there, you would be a DREAMer, because you were brought to the United States by your parent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just so many things. It&#39;s just a lot you go through emotionally too, because back in the day, we did have texting, we didn&#39;t have WhatsApp. We did have Facebook, but we didn&#39;t have FaceTime or anything like that. It was really hard to communicate with my mom. She would use those phone cards to call me. Whenever let&#39;s say if I was at work and I picked up, her calling card would be gone, so she had to stay on the phone for the exact hour to make it worth it. Now we always communicate by Facebook. We&#39;re always doing Live. We&#39;re always talking to each other through Messenger. It&#39;s just way different. I&#39;m actually happier now than I was back then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. Do you think you&#39;ll go back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to. Yes, I have that hope that I will go back, but I&#39;ll want to go back to just visit, probably go to California, Universal Studios, visit my family. That&#39;s about it. I&#39;ll just come back, because I really wouldn&#39;t find myself there. I think my home is here actually.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has your wife ever been to the U.S?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She wants to go, but she got denied. Her visa got rejected. She&#39;s actually mad about that. She&#39;s like, &quot;I don&#39;t think your people want me there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even a tourist visa she couldn&#39;t get?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she couldn&#39;t get it. I guess, I don&#39;t know, the Embassy&#39;s just really hard on everybody. Not everybody gets a visa. I&#39;m actually scared. Since they gave me 10 years not to go back, I have to complete the 10 years, and then from there I can apply for my visa, but I&#39;m scared that if I apply and they reject me, my world&#39;s going to go, it&#39;s just going to come down.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ll have several family members who are citizens by then. Your siblings are citizens, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many do you have?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your mom is now. Maybe your father will be then, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, hopefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Wow. Good luck. That&#39;s tough. It does sound like you&#39;ve made a life for yourself here and you&#39;re happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You could actually live in the United States. If you go to my house in _____, basically it&#39;s just like an American home. It&#39;s really nice. I&#39;ve worked so hard for it. I try to get ideas from the internet and all this stuff. It&#39;s just I have different way of thinking, and which is good. My future is here. I have so many goals that I still want to accomplish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like that going to school in the U.S. made you more, I don&#39;t know, successful here? If you&#39;d gone to school here, you wouldn&#39;t have had the skills or whatever to do what you&#39;ve done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Actually I&#39;ve actually thought about that, because in the U.S., education is way different from Mexico&#39;s education. For example, if you didn&#39;t go to class, they would automatically call your mom. Here, kids don&#39;t go to school and they don&#39;t really care. Actually, I am seeing this because my nephews, it was two days ago, my niece was caught huffing paint, or the paint thinner, whatever that&#39;s called. There was no cop present. Over there there would be a cop present. I don&#39;t know. They would probably give you juvie over there or get you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... some help. Here it&#39;s just like, &quot;Just talk to her.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m not their mother.&quot; I had to go and pick her up. Tardiness. Actually, I went through, what is it called, a truancy, when they would be tardy or absent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absent, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t have it here. If they pushed that a little bit, kids would be more focused in school. They don&#39;t motivate kids. The teachers don&#39;t give a crap about anything and what the kids do. Over there, your teacher&#39;s on you to finish your, because they want you to graduate. My nephew, he decided to skip class, so now he&#39;s not going to school. He dropped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old is he?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s 15. Over there, you have to. Actually in the U.S. it&#39;s actually more pushy for you to graduate. Over here it&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, just do whatever. Just do whatever you want and see if you graduate.&quot; The locations, in Utah it&#39;s like, if you live in a certain location in the city, your school is going to be the nearest school to your-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly, where you live.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Here, you have to take the test. If you pass the test, we&#39;ll see which school you qualify to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It could be really far away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s thousands of kids that take that test. Most of them, I would say 80%, go to the schools. The other ones, either your parents pay for your school or you just get a job and start living life. It&#39;s hard. It sucks to be them, honestly. I always tell my niece and nephew, I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m so thankful that I didn&#39;t do school here.&quot; They always question me why. I&#39;m like, &quot;Because I&#39;d be like you guys. I would have no future.&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Do you really think that we don&#39;t have any future?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude, if you keep up with what you&#39;re doing, I&#39;m going to see you in three years the same way, just living at your grandma&#39;s house, playing on your phone. You don&#39;t even have the motivation to ... &quot; Because when I was younger and I couldn&#39;t get a job, I would mow lawns to get money. These kids, I&#39;ll be like, &quot;Hey, can you sweep my room?&quot; They&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, no. That&#39;s too much work.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Dude. Do something. Make money.&quot; Don&#39;t make money your first priority, but-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You need it. You&#39;re not going to rely on your mom the whole time. It&#39;s just their way of thinking. We have different ways of thinking. I&#39;m grateful that my education from over there, and just the types of activities. Games that I know, sometimes I play with them, and they think it&#39;s so much fun. It&#39;s like, &quot;Then what do you do here?&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;We play with marbles or we&#39;ll go on the internet.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Really? You guys don&#39;t know how to live life,&quot; because I remember when I was growing up, we would ride bikes, skateboards, scooters. We would run barefoot. Here they don&#39;t really have a patio or a backyard to go running.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re going to write a report, pulling all these, hopefully 200, oral histories about experiences of returning migrants together, and hopefully some people will read it. Is there anything that you haven&#39;t said yet that you&#39;d like U.S. citizens, Mexican citizens to know about your experiences, that you haven&#39;t said already?</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Florizel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that whoever is migrating here to Mexico, if they&#39;re giving you help, take it. We all need help from everybody. Just take the help. It doesn&#39;t hurt. They&#39;re not asking for anything in return. They&#39;re not asking you for money. They just want you to live a better life. That&#39;s basically it. I like to help people. Whenever I have a chance, I help them out.</span></p><p class="c0 c4"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c4 c5"><span class="c2"></span></p><a id="t.58fae85fc1d07e1493d51db806e6dac2eec81174"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c11"><tbody><tr class="c15"><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c4 c14"><span class="c2"></span></p></div></body></html>
