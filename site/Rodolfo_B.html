So, for the interview let&#39;s start back at the beginning. You said you came to the US when you </span><span>were in first</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;grade or so?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like seven, six years. Like I said, my grandpa was going through hard times when my mom left because they weren&#39;t that cool. So they left first. So, I stayed with him. I was still going to go to school but one day I heard him on the phone talking how was I going to do school, to do something. He had either to go to a job or do his stuff. He can&#39;t just leave me with my grandpa&#39;s mom. He was older. So, he did like, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;ll go get him.&quot; And he told me, &quot;You know what? They&#39;re going to come get you. You&#39;re going to live with your mom. You&#39;re going to go to the States and everything. Going to go to Disneyland and everything.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;</span><span>Oh wow</span><span class="c2 c0">. She&#39;s cool.&quot; I was like, &quot;Yeah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had told me in the survey a bit about how the papers that you got that helped you get across the border. Could you tell me a little bit more about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. My uncle came, right, and he&#39;s like, &quot;Hey, you know what? Your brother&#39;s over there already. So everything is going to be okay. He&#39;s already over there. You should go with him. I&#39;m going to take you with your mom and everything.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Well, that&#39;s okay.&quot; So, when we were leaving over there he told me, &quot;Look, this is going to be some papers that you have to</span><span>...</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">tienes que estudiarlos hijo</span><span>.</span><span class="c2 c0">You have to study them. It&#39;s just the name. The name, the age, where you were born and what you do over there. What you live for over there.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And told me, &quot;Just tell them you go to school. You live with your mom. Your mom works.&quot; And what else? &quot;That name.&quot; I don&#39;t remember that name. I think it was like-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still remember now what the name was?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was ______.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don&#39;t remember the last name. But it was </span><span>______</span><span class="c0">. And he&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re </span><span>gonna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;go over there, you&#39;re </span><span>gonna</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;say that and you&#39;re g</span><span>onna</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;have the same age. Seven years, six years.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have to remember a different birthday?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but I don&#39;t remember it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#39;t remember now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really. It was a long time ago. Now it&#39;s like it was just for one time. Just crossing and that&#39;s it. But it was </span><span>______</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was the name and they were living in Los Angeles. That&#39;s it. And I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So, we left, right? And when it was time, he&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, guys, get ready everything. We landed off the plane. Everything was okay. And I could just remember going through the border. Over there, really big. A lot of people over there. It was really crowded and everything. But you could see we&#39;re still Mexico and now where it </span><span>becomes</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;the difference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they&#39;re like &quot;</span><span class="c6">La guia ya se acab&oacute;, It&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">Over here. We&#39;re going to cross and just remember, if they ask you, answer. If not, don&#39;t say nothing. Okay?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; So, he hold me. I had a little bag. Well, like a little </span><span class="c6">mochila</span><span class="c0">. Like a little bag and everything. And they looked at me and they&#39;re like, &quot;Hi.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Hi.&quot; I said that a couple of more times. She&#39;s like, &quot;Hi.&quot; </span><span>Then </span><span class="c0">like, &quot;What&#39;s your name?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;</span><span>_____</span><span class="c0">.&quot; And they&#39;re like, &quot;Okay. Who&#39;s he?&quot; Now she went like that. I didn&#39;t even know how to say uncle. I just went like that. And then my uncle hurried and tell them something. Now they were lik</span><span>e n</span><span class="c2 c0">o English.&quot; Like, &quot;No, he&#39;s really shy, you know? He&#39;s my little nephew.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they looked at him, they looked at me. And they&#39;re like, &quot;Put your bag over here</span><span>, they searched it and...</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember if you were scared or excited?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was nervous. I was nervous in a way because I don&#39;t know why they was asking me that. I was young. I didn&#39;t know if that was illegal. I didn&#39;t know that that was going to get you in trouble if you get caught. I was like not knowing but I was a kid. I was like kind of shy. More shy, not really scared. But shy. But it just went okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then when you get older and you start knowing</span><span>&hellip;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I know my uncle was scared. I know he was, I wasn&#39;t. But he looked nervous. So, if he gets caught doing that he&#39;s going to prison probably. Not me because I&#39;m not doing nothing but just crossing. And yes, we crossed. He hold my hand really hard. We crossed and that&#39;s it. We got in a car that was waiting for us. And I think it was his friend.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We drove and it was getting kind of dark. So he&#39;s like </span><span class="c6 c0">ahorita</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c0">I&#39;m going to say it in English,</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">but he told me in Spanish. &quot;Right now when we get to the police. Go in the back and just act like you&#39;re sleeping, okay?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot; We drove for like, what, 20 minutes, 30, I think. And he&#39;s like, &quot;Do what I told you.&quot; And like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So I covered like normal and I played. </span><span>I guess they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;were flashing lights. And they stopped him and were like, &quot;Where you going? Where you coming from?&quot; I think that was from San Diego where you gonna cross at. &quot;Where you coming from? Is everything okay? Can you guys help me get in your trunk really fast?&quot; They got off, I was just... When I got home.</span><span>&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, do you remember what was it like... You lived in LA first, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember what it was like when you first arrived in LA?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I got home and saw my mom and she hugged me. Family&#39;s back together and everything. Let&#39;s say I didn&#39;t go to school for a month, two months. And I didn&#39;t even used to go out. I used to be home. We used to go out to eat and all that. But then she told me, &quot;You know what? You&#39;re going to have to go to school, son. They&#39;re going to help you right there.&quot; But I&#39;m like, &quot;They talk different right here, mom.&quot; She&#39;s like, &quot;That&#39;s cool. You&#39;ll learn. You</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">ll learn.&quot; And I&#39;m like, &quot;ah, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she signed me up for school. My first days were like, &quot;Damn, I don&#39;t even know what to do.&quot; I used to see a lot of kids and they&#39;re different. Right here you go to school but just with Mexicans. And over there I used to see... I mean, not that I&#39;m racist, but you used to see white people, Chinese people, Asian people, everything. So, I was like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">It&#39;s going to be cool. You&#39;ll get around.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were excited about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was excited about that. But I used to hear &lsquo;em talk different, see them sit on a different area and everything. When I started advancing and started learning about what&#39;s going on, I&#39;m like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t want to sit here anymore. I&#39;m going to have to go over there with the other people too. They did it, I could do it too.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;People used to get out the group and I&#39;m like, &quot;Damn, it&#39;s going to have to be my time one time.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And </span><span>yeah</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;so, I study a lot. I practiced it a lot with my cousins and everything. </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Hey, fool, how do you say this</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;if you want to talk to a girl or something like that</span><span>. You know?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Even my teacher, she used to tell me</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c0">that </span><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Spanish</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot;You want to go to the bathroom? Tell me in English.&quot; And that&#39;s how you got to start going, &quot;Hey, what color are your pants?&quot; She used to ask you and like, &quot;They&#39;re black, right?&quot; And like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that&#39;s how I started learning. But I wanted to learn because I </span><span>like</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;I </span><span class="c0">want to go out</span><span>.&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>S</span><span class="c0">chool</span><span>,</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s how I started. LA, well you started getting... That was like, little kid. Now that you learn a little bit more, you see that LA&#39;s like... She&#39;s like this </span><span>b</span><span class="c2 c0">ig city and everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what part of LA you lived in?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>From&hellip; </span><span class="c0">What&#39;s it called? Used to be, like Compton but not the</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Compton.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>...not </span><span class="c2 c0">black side. The Mexican side.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I heard that they&#39;re like different sides. But it was really close to where all the homies used to be. That&#39;s when I told you you started getting older. </span><span>&nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">Let&#39;s say when I go to middle school that was different but now you see that there was gangs and everything. You could either be whatever you want but there was always going to be gangs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did people from gangs ever approach you to try to get you to join?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I had a couple cousins that were older than me. So, they&#39;re like, &quot;Come kick it with us. Gang bang with us and shit. Isn&#39;t nobody going to trip with you in school.&quot; But you know what? I always was like, &quot;No, man. You should try to talk to everybody.&quot; I don&#39;t want to have beef with all gangs, black people or white people. I&#39;d rather talk to everybody. But they were like, &quot;It&#39;s cool then if that&#39;s what you want. But just remember, if you need anything we&#39;ll back you up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I used to talk to everybody. I didn&#39;t really have trouble on that. Like not getting jumped and all that or doing this dumb shit in school. I was always cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy LeGree:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did any of your friends have trouble with gangs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, some fools, they joined them. I used to still talk to them and everything but there was a lot of trouble with those fools. I used to see them sometimes beating. They were young and everything. I tasted it. I&#39;m not going to lie and everything. But fucking with drugs and all that, but I didn&#39;t really like it. I drink beer and everything but like sniffing coke, smoking weed and all that. I tasted it but I didn&#39;t like it. So, I was just, &quot;Nah, fuck that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Go out with friends. </span><span>Go to the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;movies. That was really fun. </span><span>G</span><span class="c2 c0">o to the movies, go to the mall, kick it around houses and all of that. Like I said, I used to drink but not really. And I used to drink but I didn&#39;t really taste any drugs. And at the moment right here, I didn&#39;t really like them. I used to smoke but not no more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I saw that in LA. But when we moved to </span><span>Riverside</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;that was another change because it&#39;s just like, different area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy LeGree:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was </span><span>Riverside</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;like compared to LA?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was still but not that much gangs. There was gangs and everything but not that much. Most of my cousins lived down there too, and it was way better. I liked it more. It was more like a little city. It wasn&#39;t that big but it was cool. I liked it more. There used to be a lake where I used to live and it&#39;s called Lake Elsinore. So we used to go there. Dana Point. I like to go outside. Like, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go over here. Let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go, let&#39;s go.&quot; And I really liked it. The food, everything over there in the States like way different. Once you&#39;re here you miss the food from over there. And once you&#39;re there, you miss the food from over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy LeGree:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a certain food you miss the most from the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot I used to like the Mexican food from over there. Sounds weird but I used to like it, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around here it&#39;s kind of expensive. I used to go over there, what, every day. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go to Burger King. Let&#39;s go to Jack-in-the-Box. Let&#39;s go to Taco Bell.&quot; I used to like Taco Bell grande burrito a lot. And there&#39;s none of them here. Only Burger King and Jack-in-the-Box is really the same here. And I used to go over there every day. Around here you got to keep waiting until you get paid at least to go once, you know. And you&#39;re like, &quot;Damn.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, yeah, the food. The clothes. Around here, to buy some good sneakers you need to work like... You could buy them in one payment but everything&#39;s going to go out. You can&#39;t pay rent and all that. So, just to buy some you need to work like two months. And over there, you could just buy them in one week. My uncle used to give me $100, like I said, for working with him each day. And my tennis shoes I used to buy over there were like let&#39;s say $50</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;$20 for a pair </span><span>of Dickies</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;and a white shirt.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could get all that for one day&#39;s work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For one day as work and you could still save, like what, $10 for a meal. I used to be like, &quot;Damn.&quot; But since I used to live with my mom and everything, I used to get everything. But to dress up yourself... I could do whatever I want with my $100.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was some funny part. Let me just tell you really quick. When I started work, well, they wouldn&#39;t sell me beer at the stores or anything like that. So there was an abandoned hotel like five blocks from my house. And a lot of homeless people used to live in it. And we used to go, let&#39;s say, six guys. &quot;Hey, fool. Pitch in a $20 everybody.&quot; Buy us a $100. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go hit up that junkie guy. Hey, what&#39;s up guy? You want to win yourself a couple beers.&quot; He went, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Go buy us something.&quot; &quot;What you guys need?&quot; So, he used to buy Black and Mild&#39;s, the drinks and everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very clever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;If you don&#39;t come back we</span><span>&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;look for you, we&#39;ll jump you.&quot; He was like, &quot;Oh no, I&#39;ll come back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was in </span><span>Riverside</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;or here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, </span><span>Riverside</span><span class="c2 c0">. When I started I was like, what, like 14, 15. And that&#39;s how we used to do it, and that&#39;s how we started having fun. That was cool. And that&#39;s it. That&#39;s how we kept it. Going to school. I miss school a lot over there. When I was in middle school, high school everything is nice. You be like, &quot;Damn.&quot; You go to the schools right here and you&#39;ll be like, &quot;Damn they look kind of,&quot;... Compared to that ones, you&#39;ll be like, &quot;Damn, they&#39;re kind of whack.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Over there I remember we used to have a swimming pool, gym, everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to go to&mdash;I was in middle school, </span><span>in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>Temscal Canyon </span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;High School. What you&#39;re going to pay here at a really expensive school, you used to have it for free over there. You even used to eat good at school. They give you pizza, burritos. So it was really nice. And the study, the teachers, everything. Even the transportation like the bus and everything. They used to drop you off not in your house, your house. But there was a bus stop and then you could walk home. And everything was really nice. I liked it over there. It was really cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there a favorite memory about the US or a favorite experience or something that you miss the most?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the trips with my family. Trips over there. Because we used to be together. Like going to the beach and all of that. That was really cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What beaches did you go to when you were in LA?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot. I went to Santa Cruz, Dana Point, Long Beach. What else? I don&#39;t really remember the names. But the most I like were those.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LA has nice beaches.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;LA. You got Dana Point. What was the other one? It was a really big one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Monica, Venice...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Santa Monica. And there was one-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...Redondo</span><span>.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Jose. No, San Jose, San Don Pedro or something like that. That was really cool because I don&#39;t really know if it was there but if it was that one, I was just young. But they used to take me on a trip</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I think it&#39;s </span><span>Alcatraz?</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to take you on a trip. And that was a really nice park. We used to go </span><span>to </span><span class="c2 c0">eat fish. Because they have everything right there. Like, &quot;Hey, you want something?&quot; Let&#39;s say a lobster or a fish or something. It was on the tanks.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You choose it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They used to take them out and do everything you want and everything. And sit you next to the, like... Let&#39;s say you&#39;re eating right here but the sea is right there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really cool. Trips with the family. &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go to the beach.&quot; There was one beach when ... How do you say? </span><span class="c6">Marian</span><span class="c0">? Or like </span><span class="c6 c0">la Maria</span><span class="c2 c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Marina.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. When it goes down you could really walk into... Let&#39;s say</span><span>, y</span><span class="c2 c0">ou know where there&#39;s going to be deep but you could go when that goes down.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah. Like at low tide.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Low tide. And it was really cool because you used to find stuff and you used to find stuff that the ocean takes. Like one day I found a golden chain and all that. It was really cool. But most of the trip with all the family together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what about... </span><span>W</span><span class="c2 c0">hat was the worst thing about being in the US? So was there one bad experience that stands out or something that was the worst part?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go to middle school and all that. I think that&#39;s when everybody like... You could grow up with some friends in elementary. And once you hit up over there and if you start hanging people, like I say, &quot;Man, </span><span>well now</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m older. Now I&#39;m going to gang bang. Or now we just don&#39;t talk to Mexicans no more. Or let&#39;s not talk to blacks.&quot; I think that&#39;s the worst because there were some friends that I lost just for being Mexican. And it&#39;s like, &quot;Hey, no fool. Don&#39;t talk to those guys. Fuck those guys.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn&#39;t want to talk to you because you were Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but I grew up with them since I was in elementary. And once we hit up middle school, they started making their little groups apart. And everything fall down. Like, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up fool? Why you don&#39;t want to talk to me anymore?&quot; &quot;Just let&#39;s keep it like that. I don&#39;t want no problems.&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t want no problems either. We used to kick it in elementary. What&#39;s going on now?&quot; And it&#39;s just I think that&#39;s what happened. Like the most </span><span>racist</span><span class="c0">. The </span><span>racist</span><span class="c2 c0">, that&#39;s what happens. That&#39;s what fucks everything up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, like middle school is when you started being aware of or it started being more racist?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, of how really shit&#39;s going to be down there. But I was like, &quot;I&#39;ll talk to anybody that wants to talk.&quot; Like I said, I used to have a lot of friends. Asians, Mexicans, white people, black people. I used to talk to everybody and it was really cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you didn&#39;t care about what race people were that you were friends with?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I didn&#39;t care.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wanted to be friends with everyone?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And that was cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, would you </span><span>be able</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;to tell a little bit more about how your family ended up bringing you back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, let&#39;s say... I don&#39;t know if my mom had some problems over there, y</span><span>ou know</span><span class="c0">. She didn&#39;t really tell me with my brother. And she told, &quot;You know what? We&#39;re going to go see your grandpa because he&#39;s really sick and all of that.&quot; But I used to talk to my grandpa, &quot;Hey, </span><span>grandpa</span><span class="c0">, you need some [</span><span>inaudible</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;00:19:28] because I heard you&#39;re sick and everything.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;No, I&#39;m cool.&quot; And everything. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were 18?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah. My mom wants to go.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;No, tell her not to bring you here. Finish your school and do what you got to do and tell her not to bring you here.&quot; &quot;I already told her but she doesn&#39;t want to.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m going to talk to her.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; And I used to tell her, &quot;Hey, my grandpa doesn&#39;t want me. You go. You&#39;re going to come back, right? So, you go.&quot; And her boyfriend used to tell me, &quot;Yeah, just leave him here.&quot; Then I found out that really the problem was with her boyfriend. They didn&#39;t want to be together anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that&#39;s why she left?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, we came back and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you feel about... </span><span>O</span><span class="c2 c0">nce you realized that you were going to stay in Mexico? That you weren&#39;t going back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when I said, &quot;Fuck.&quot; That&#39;s </span><span>why</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;I told you. She just grab a couple clothes like you think you&#39;re going on vacation. But my shoes, clothes, personal items, my girlfriend, everything. I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I&#39;m going to be back.&quot; So, when I was down here and I realized I was like, &quot;Fuck.&quot; I used to talk with my girl when I was down here. She&#39;d call me, &quot;How&#39;s Mexico?&quot; And I&#39;m, &quot;It&#39;s cool and everything.&quot; &quot;Bring me something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>T</span><span class="c0">hat&#39;s what happened. One thing I remember here, she gave me a golden necklace. It was a triple gold. Do you know there&#39;s rose gold, white gold, and like that. It was from her 15 years and I had it. And when I got here, </span><span>I didn&rsquo;t last too long, </span><span class="c0">I got caught by the cops down here. Because like I said I was drinking too. You know, I used to drink and I was drinking. So, they caught me</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c2 c0">by probably the way I dressed, I didn&#39;t look like if I was from here. They stopped me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You looked like you were from Mexico</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c0">or you looked like you were from the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cops were probably looking at you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that is?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now a lot of things change. You know why? Because people be singing rap and all of it. And they dress as over there. But if you&#39;ve been around here, you could tell that most people dress like normal. Like normal things. But if you dress kind of baggy, like gang banging, you could tell like, &quot;Oh, you know what? He bangs.&quot; Over there, you got a lot of people do it. Down here you don&#39;t really see a lot of gangsters down here. Or the way black people dress </span><span>was</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;different. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like code clothing. Like codes. They have codes. Like when they say Crips, they dress blue and red and like that. And right here they don&#39;t really use that. But if let&#39;s say... Right here. How can I say? If you go to my hood right now where I live, you could tell people don&#39;t dress like they do here. Like suits or... They do but mostly everybody are like... That&#39;s why they put that shit down there, like a </span><span class="c6">chaca</span><span class="c2 c0">. They dress like these type of clothes and all of that. So, that&#39;s how you could tell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back, the cops stopped me. They took some cash I had because I was drinking. </span><span>B</span><span class="c0">ut I didn&#39;t know what to tell them. &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up? </span><span class="c6">&iquest;Por qu&eacute; me detuvo el oficial?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Why did you stop me? I&#39;m not...&quot; &quot;You&#39;re drinking.&quot; &quot;Yeah, but I&#39;m not drinking right here. I&#39;m drinking at my house. </span><span>I smell but</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&#39;t </span><span>drink</span><span class="c0">.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re drinking, you</span><span>&rsquo;re drinking</span><span class="c2 c0">. Let me see what you got there.&quot; They just took it like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>The necklace.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I got mad and I told them, &quot;Hey, fool, give me my shit back.&quot; And I pushed them. </span><span class="c6 c0">Le dije</span><span>&hellip;.</span><span class="c0">I told them in Spanish though, &quot;Hey, give me my shit back,&quot; and I pushed him. And he had some fool just punched me in the back. And he took out my earring and I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh, fuck.&quot; Like, &quot;Yeah, yeah </span><span class="c0">[foreign 00:23:18]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c0">.&quot; like, &quot;Hey, </span><span>g</span><span class="c0">et the fuck out of here, fool.&quot; But I was like, &quot;Hell no. My </span><span>chain, my chain</span><span class="c0">.&quot; And I started tripping for my </span><span>chain</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;so they took me with them. They got me in the police car. They jumped me in the back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They jumped you in the back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, they had me in the back hitting me and everything. And they&#39;re like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You&#39;re not going to get it back. If you don&#39;t...</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>L</span><span class="c2 c0">ike in Spanish. Well, it sounds different in Spanish than it does in English. &quot;If you keep fucking around we&#39;re going to put some fucking drugs on you and you&#39;re going to go where you don&#39;t like it.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;Fuck man.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wait, so they said if you keep fucking around, they&#39;ll put drugs on you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they can arrest you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Like I was on the back and he&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re not going to get it back. If you keep acting stupid right now we&#39;re going to put some drugs on you and you&#39;re going to get it worse. So might as well.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s like they&#39;ll put drugs on you so that they-</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they can send me to jail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re like, &quot;We&#39;re going to put some drugs on your ass.&quot; That&#39;s why I say in Spanish it sounds different. </span><span>It&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like, </span><span class="c6">Si, si sigues chingando pues ahorita &nbsp;pues te vamos a meter unos topes wey y te vas a chingar wey</span><span class="c0">. Like, &quot;If you keep fucking around we&#39;re going to put some Mary Jane on you and you&#39;re going to go to jail.&quot; So, I was like, &quot;Fuck.&quot; &quot;And we&#39;re going to drop you off. </span><span class="c6">Te vamos a tumbar y ya vete a la verga</span><span>.</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;We&#39;re going to drop you off and get the fuck out of here.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck.

I got off and fuck it, I just head home walking. I&#39;m like, &quot;Fuck. Shit, it&#39;s going to be different here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How soon did that happen after you left the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a month.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, it&#39;s pretty new.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was like, &quot;Fuck, shit it&#39;s going to be different here.&quot; Because the cops over there, I know there are... Like, come on. I know there&#39;s some crooked. But they weren&#39;t that crooked. Cops over there, they even look strong. They</span><span>&rsquo;re ready. </span><span class="c2 c0">They look like real fucking cops. Not like the people here. Fuck no. Cops down here be like really fucked up. Right now at the moment it&#39;s still too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m wondering. So you mentioned the cops. That they could kind of tell that you were from the US looking at you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like other people treated you that way too? Like either just people on the street or people from gangs approaching you? Anything like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the people that are in my neighborhood. They&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, look, there&#39;s my cousin. He came from over there from the States.&quot; And they look because, like I said, if you dress a little bit better, not like that but you have a little bit better clothes and everything. And they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, well.&quot; And if you don&#39;t dress like how they dress down here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I used to live over there I used to love Dickies, Levis, Tommy and all that. So I brought it with me. And right now you don&#39;t see that much people with a Tommy because it&#39;s expensive down here. And they be like, &quot;Hey, look at that fool. He probably has cash.&quot; Or they&#39;re going to say this, &quot;He probably has some money or he&#39;s not from around here.&quot; Just like over there. </span><span>Let&rsquo;s</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;say you go and dressed up with Chanel on fucking Compton, they&#39;re going to say like, &quot;Hey, this fool isn&#39;t from here. Let&#39;s see what&#39;s up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, same thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the same things going to be, right, like that. And that&#39;s how shit happens. And that was one of my worst experiences, losing that chain. The next I told her, I talked to her and like, &quot;Hey, you still got my chain?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I still got it.&quot; I talk about you know I drink. And one time, that was really fucked up &lsquo;cause one time she just didn&#39;t answer the phone. And I didn&#39;t even get to talk to her. I told my cousin, &quot;Hey, fool, go look for her. Tell her what&#39;s up. You know? And is she going to wait for me? How come she </span><span>don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;answer her phone, and she don&#39;t want to talk to me anymore? What&#39;s up?&quot; And they used to go look for her but supposedly she was never home. And nest, yeah they moved. I don&#39;t know what happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, she just kind of disappeared from your life?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, if you have to </span><span>choose</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;one thing that was the hardest about coming back to Mexico, what would it be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The change. Everything. The change stuff, my family, losing everything over there, start again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Starting over? One thing that I&#39;ve heard a lot of people say is that they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re totally from either place. Like they don&#39;t belong in either country. Do you ever feel like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning probably you feel it like that. Like, &quot;Damn, man, I miss it over there,&quot; and all that. But I&#39;ve been growing up, I&#39;ve been, &quot;</span><span>Nah</span><span class="c0">, fuck that. Wherever I go I got to be someone. I got to be something. It doesn&#39;t matter if I&#39;m down here or I&#39;m in the U.S. If I&#39;m in the </span><span class="c6">el estado</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;from around here, </span><span>in the</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;city, on the little town, you got to be something. So, I took that off my mind and I was like, &quot;Man, fuck it. It&#39;s okay. Wherever I roll, wherever I stay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what are your hopes for your future in Mexico or wherever you end up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, right now I used to rent</span><span>. You do</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;things on the streets too. You do things that makes you earn money. So I earn some money. Where I used to be renting I told that fool, &quot;Hey what&#39;s up, dawg</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>Show me</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;apartments</span><span>.</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, how much you going to give me?&quot; &quot;Well, I don&#39;t got it complete. I could give you half or I could give you some part and pay like the rent.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, well, I don&#39;t really like that neighborhood.&quot; And he said, &quot;Fuck it. I&#39;ll sell it to you.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; &quot;Got a good job?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#39;s good because it pays my dues.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I want to do something like... I don&#39;t know, I want to put a little business going on. Like food probably. Because food is always going to move like that. Food or technology. You know, like phones and all of that? It&#39;s always going to move. And that&#39;s what I want to do. Either food or technology, or buy and sell.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy and sell what? Something from the US or</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you could</span><span>&mdash;y</span><span class="c0">ou know what&#39;s a really good business down here? Like I said, right here you got to work your ass off to buy some fucking nice pair of shoes. I could call my cousin, &quot;Hey, fool, you know what? I&#39;m going to send you some money. Buy me some fucking bad ass Jordans over there. How much are they?&quot; Let&#39;s say $120. Right </span><span>here it&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like what? Like 2,000 pesos. And that&#39;s how they are right here, or maybe more. Like 3,000. But you could win it. I know if you buy over there on discounts then send it over here and you make the half. And the trust people you could tell them, &quot;You know what? I&#39;ll sell you this, fool.&quot; &quot;How much</span><span>?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span class="c6">tanto</span><span>.</span><span class="c2 c0">&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it, dawg. You could get two months to pay it.&quot; But in those two months I know I&#39;m making my money. And like that...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I buy phones. I&#39;m going to be honest. Over there where I live there&#39;s a lot of people jacking shit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like stealing phones?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stealing phones, stealing gold. Gold is a really good shit down here. Stealing whatever. And they&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, if you want to buy this shit, I&#39;ll give it to you for cheaper.&quot; Like, &quot;All right. Does it work?&quot; &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;All right. Let me check it out, dawg.&quot; And then you check it out, you test it and everything. &quot;How much you want?&quot; Let&#39;s say this one costs... I don&#39;t know how much it&#39;s going to cost but let&#39;s say 2,000. They say, &quot;No, homie. I&#39;m going to fucking give you 1,000 right now. You want it?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;You got it?&quot; &quot;Yeah, I got it.&quot; And I know I&#39;m going to make those 2,000 out of it. So, I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah. Fuck yeah, I got it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And like, in </span><span>bursts,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you know? </span><span>P</span><span class="c2 c0">ay it and sell it. Pay and sell, you&#39;re making money like that. You&#39;re making it more. And let&#39;s say right now you just want out of this 1,000. But let&#39;s say on a month you did a lot of little business like that. So, now you don&#39;t just got 1,000, you got 10,000.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you could buy something bigger. Like, &quot;Hey, you know what, fool? I&#39;m selling a motorcycle.&quot; &quot;How much you want for it?&quot; &quot;Oh, I want 12,000 for it?&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;ll give you 10,000.&quot; And you know you&#39;re going to sell it for 13,000. Now I have 13,000. That&#39;s how I&#39;m going to do it. But I got to put a business up because that&#39;s always making money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about food? What type of food would you sell if you start a business?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why fish?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like shrimps, oysters. Because that&#39;s what I like. I like to eat that. And I know if you make it good, they&#39;ll pay you good. I know there&#39;s a lot of fancy place for shrimp down here. And down here, it&#39;s expensive. For the sun, for the type of girls are down there and everything. And the type of people that go there. But trust me, you could go eat in the ghetto spot. If it&#39;s good they&#39;ll go and they&#39;ll pay. They won&#39;t say no. It&#39;s like you. You go around </span><span>eating</span><span class="c2 c0">. Like, &quot;I&#39;m not going to come back here. This sucks.&quot; That&#39;s what it tastes like. But if you make it good...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to work in a restaurant too, so that&#39;s where I was at and I learned a lot of things from the ladies. They used to tell me, &quot;</span><span class="c6 c0">No </span><span class="c6">mijo esto se hace asi</span><span>&mdash;</span><span class="c2 c0">You make this like this. This is how you make the sauce. Go get some oysters. So, I know what type of cheese.&quot; Clean it, put some cheese, there is some spinach. You mix that with something, the spinach. And you put some type of cheese on it. And there&#39;s a little fire up here. And then she just put it right there and everything melts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that sounds good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it looks good and it tastes as good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got to sell that at your restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I am. And that plate over there was like, what, 400 bucks. Like $40. And that was kind of expensive but if you could sell... That was because it was a nice place. But if you make it on a little one and </span><span>say a beginning one</span><span class="c0">. What? Sell it for 200, and they&#39;ll pay. But that&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do. I&#39;m </span><span>going to start selling</span><span class="c2 c0">&nbsp;fish, and gold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fish and gold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buying and selling gold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Good combination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gold never goes down. You kind of keep going up. Some of my friends over there, they buy dollars. So, when it goes really low they go and fucking buy them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Buy them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But when it goes up, that&#39;s never going to... You know dollars are never going to go down. Maybe sometimes but not right now. I think of a lot of business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it seems like you have a lot of ideas about what you need to do, businesses to start.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I just need to concentrate on one thing right now. I got this job and everything but the homies right now. They&#39;re putting up a barbershop right now. They&#39;re doing it. They&#39;re not just talking about it. Just do it. You don&#39;t just think about it, it&#39;s always going to be on your mind. It&#39;s not going to be right there making you money. That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do. I&#39;m just earning a little bit. Earning, earning. And when I get 200 and something more, I&#39;m going to start something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, as we start wrapping up, is there anything that you feel like that you haven&#39;t gotten a chance to share yet or any part of your story that you haven&#39;t gotten to talk about? Any last things you want to say?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, we could go ahead and go on and on. Like talking things from over there and comparing to down here. But like I said, most important things were like that. But like I said, I miss it. I talk to my brother over there. Like I said, I could tell him, &quot;Hey, fool.&quot; Let&#39;s say on Black Friday. &quot;I&#39;m going to send you some money, dawg. I&#39;m going to send you like $1,000, but send me some bomb ass Jordans. Or the best shit&#39;s that&#39;s over there or the best clothes.&quot; And I know I&#39;m going to sell it probably double right here because you don&#39;t buy... And I&#39;m going to start doing something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But if I could go back to the States, not right now. Even if they tell me, &quot;No, come back right now,&quot; I won&#39;t. If Trump decides not to offer jobs and not to fuck around with not just Mexicans, illegal people from everywhere. I&#39;ll go. Because I like the life over there. Like I said, right here there is a </span><span>Carl&rsquo;s Jr. </span><span class="c2 c0">around here. And I can&#39;t go right now because it&#39;s fucking expensive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s say you go out and you tell your girlfriend, &quot;Hey, let&#39;s go. Let&#39;s go to </span><span>Carl&rsquo;s Jr</span><span class="c0">. It&#39;s really nice and let&#39;s go to the movies. Come on, let&#39;s go.&quot; You&#39;re going to waste 500 bucks right now just by sitting on </span><span>Carl&rsquo;s Jr</span><span class="c2 c0">. Two combos and some chili cheese fries. And you&#39;ll be like, &quot;Fuck, that&#39;s 500.&quot; Two days of job. And you&#39;re like, &quot;Fuck.&quot; No, might as well let&#39;s just go get the tacos and fucking waste 200 right there. But yeah, if she deserves it so fuck it. Let&#39;s go.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you are hoping to go back to the US if things were to change?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got a little girl right here so that&#39;s not really</span><span>&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have a daughter?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I got a little girl right here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, how old is she?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six years old? Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If I could go back since the beginning, that&#39;s what I was thinking. I would have gone back. But no, right now with my little girl. Like I said, my cousins told me, &quot;Come over here, dawg. Fuck it.&quot; Because she&#39;s going to probably think that I left her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does she live with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She used to. They used to live with me but now I have like eight months that I hear from them. They live with their grandpas and everything. I live by myself. And my days off I go get her. Take her over there. Be with her, next take her back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How often do you get to see her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now since her mom and I got in a fight for some dumb shit, I haven&#39;t seen her since like a month already. And I&#39;ve been telling, &quot;Hey, let me see her. Don&#39;t be like that.&quot; &quot;Oh, I got some [foreign 00:38:18].&quot; Then I drop it off with her dad and her mom. So I&#39;m catching up. But I haven&#39;t seen her for a month. And I was like, &quot;Fuck.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But normally, I used to see her every day I was off. I used to go pick her up, take her home, pick her up, take her home. Right now I haven&#39;t seen her since a month. It was what? Two times a week I used to see her, but not right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy LeGree:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you&#39;re thinking you wouldn&#39;t want to leave her behind going to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I know it&#39;s going to be a better life because I could earn, send her more money and everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy LeGree:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then you wouldn&#39;t be able to see her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>Rodolfo</span><span class="c2 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, that&#39;s what happened. Not everything is money. Time. Time has value too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.
