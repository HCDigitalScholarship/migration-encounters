I</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;have</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;one more question. It&#39;s not really a question. You&#39;ve told your story. Is there anything you like people to know about you or the whole process of migration and return that you haven&#39;t said yet, that you would like people either in the United States or in Mexico to know? Is there something you&#39;d like to end with?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, only want to say to people to continue to their dream, continue to try to get the papers, try to do the right things for don&#39;t pass through the process I passed. That&#39;s only I want to say to the people, I don&#39;t know, to see my story. It&#39;s a lot of people, </span><span class="c3">they</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;are bad people. That guy destroyed my life only because I&#39;m Mexican, I don&#39;t know. He don&#39;t like my face or whatever, I don&#39;t know. He destroyed my life. I don&#39;t do nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe let me go back to him. I forgot about him. Was he just a random person who called ICE or do you think he was working for ICE and entrapping Mexicans and immigrants who are here without documents?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Maybe he&#39;s racist because, after that, he start to talk about the Mexican, a lot of shit. He said ta ta ta ... Mexican, go to the Mexico. We are Americans and we don&#39;t need you to steal the jobs to the Americans. He start talking a lot about </span><span class="c3">the</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;stuff to the Mexicans. I think he called the cops, the ICE for racist. He don&#39;t like the Mexican, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know why he called the cops.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He don&#39;t pay me my washing machines. I give him the new ones. He stay with my old ones and he get the new ones. He don&#39;t pay me nothing. He </span><span class="c3">stole me</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;to steal my money, my appliances, and</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;then</span><span class="c0 c2">&nbsp;he called the cops because he&#39;s racist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you find a lot of racism [crosstalk 00:37:50] in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m see a lot of people racist, a lot of American people racist. I&#39;m see a lot of people but I&#39;m see the good person. Americans very, very good person. You know, its a half and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody&#39;s perfect. I don&#39;t know why he do that. I don&#39;t know why. Sometimes, I&#39;m making the question why, what&#39;d I do? What I do to him? I didn&#39;t do nothing. Why he do that? He destroyed my life. He don&#39;t know-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3">And y</span><span class="c0 c2">our son&#39;s life and your wife&#39;s life.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine, my son, my wife, my life, all my family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see racism here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0 c2">Humberto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;m see the Mexican racist because they all worked on the United States, don&#39;t come to steal my job, or don&#39;t come to steal my opportunities here.
