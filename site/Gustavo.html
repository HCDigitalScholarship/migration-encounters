No?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Over there [in the US]? No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did you live with when you were in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just my parents.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I&#39;m an only child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that nice?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eh, most people think so, but not for me. Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have an only child so tell me why it&#39;s not nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s one of those things to where you do appreciate that you don&#39;t have to have more of a hassle dealing with other people, but it feels quite lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Particularly when your parents get older. Then it sucks I think.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, it teaches you the value of time, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You look like your mom. Where are you frightened of US authorities?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your family send money to relatives in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. At least not of my knowledge, but no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many years did you live in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From when I was two to 12, so 10 years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you follow US news when you were there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, yes, but I would say that I followed them more here&hellip; surprisingly.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I&#39;m going to ask you that in a minute. How did you follow it when you were there? By TV? By&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, TV. You know, just-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Social media?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I grew up a little bit before the social media, so kind of, but it was mainly from the newspaper, from what was around me, stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What newspapers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Chicago Time, I think. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you follow Mexican news?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I still don&#39;t. Which is bad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you left the United States because your dad was deported, you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you guys left?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, not right away. It took, I would say the whole process time then that&#39;s when we finally came back, but even then we waited for another I would say two or three months and then that&#39;s when we finally came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came back because he&#39;d been deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You just came back on your own then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was just me and my mom.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So&hellip; how long have you been back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since I was 12. So I would say seven years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You live in Mexico City now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who do you live with now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still just my parents, but I mean, it&rsquo;s like a joint house. So there&#39;s other relatives, but...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Do you know programs that help people who&#39;ve lived in the US and come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve heard of them, but I&#39;ve never officially looked into any of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are these programs run by the government or by not government?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Usually, it&#39;s based from America government, like programs from over there trying to help people from over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ah, interesting. Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I haven&#39;t officially seen anything here of my own government really trying to help anyone, no. Like me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think your government doesn&#39;t help out other people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean it&rsquo;s the same reason why they don&#39;t help out that many other people, because they&#39;re not intelligent enough or they just don&#39;t care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you just heard about these programs? Have you studied since you&#39;ve been back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I went to middle school and I almost finished all of it, but then I had dropped out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So some of it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Because here, middle school and high school are joined. So technically I completed all of middle school, but since the freshman year is conjoined with middle school, I was going to be a freshman.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you did up to ninth grade?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Basically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&#39;d you drop out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school here is shitty&hellip; to put it blunt. Yeah, that&#39;s the main reason and plus, it was one of those things to where I was, I guess, used to the system from over there [in the US]. So over here, it&#39;s a completely different system and then on top of that, I couldn&#39;t migrate as best as I believed I could and some teachers were failing me on purpose because I knew better English than them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you mean just to piss you off?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, basically. So it was just a whole bunch of things that I couldn&#39;t deal with anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you worked?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Here and there some jobs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of jobs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to help one of my... I think he&#39;s my... Well, my mom&#39;s uncle with cars and stuff like that. Nothing official.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mechanical?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, mechanical and stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember how much you were paid in your last job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The last job was with my parents and it was 3,000/4,000 pesos.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every how often?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Every two weeks.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, but that could be said the same thing about Chicago. I didn&#39;t feel that safe over there either, but it&#39;s safe enough to where I know nothing will happen to me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been the victim of a crime?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not necessarily.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel that you&#39;re vulnerable because you lived in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because the part of Mexico that I lived in is similar to Chicago. They have all the crime over there so there was no real change in that. It was just some cops were better. Here, there&#39;s no cops that are good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you mean you&#39;re used to the Chicago streets and so it wasn&#39;t such an adjustment to get used to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s just here people are a lot more shittier. That&#39;s definitely the truth. At least over there, there was people that did want to help here. Here, there is people that want to help, but it&#39;s very, very rare.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s been difficult to come back to Mexico&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;I get the sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to ask you some questions why and then maybe we can talk a little bit about that. Was it difficult to find a job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here? For me, not so much because I have more opportunities, but since one of my difficulties was learning Spanish coming here, because I didn&#39;t know Spanish growing up, so I would say no, but for me a little bit more, because I didn&#39;t know that much Spanish when I first came.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about continuing your education?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.

Most people would agree with how many animals we have too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many animals do you have?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight dogs and 10 cats. Yes. I mean that&#39;s why you can say I&#39;m a single, only child, but there&#39;s a lot to deal with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. [Chuckles]</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was so good about the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it was just the environment. Because Chicago&#39;s environment is mainly aggressive and there&#39;s a lot of crime everywhere, but over there I had people that actually did want to help me, a teacher that really wanted to help me and just normal day people over there, just trying to survive is way better than here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was the teacher?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot her name, which is bad, but she was my fifth grade teacher. And I had a chance of a scholarship over there when I was younger and because I didn&#39;t have papers, I couldn&#39;t enroll into it but it was a pretty good scholarship because it was going to pay for Chicago University there all the way if I maintained my grades good from then on. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you mean you would have qualified for the DACA Program? Is that what you&#39;re talking about?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know if it was the DACA program because it was offered to other people that weren&#39;t like me, they were just, I guess, really smart people because there was only three other people in my classroom that were qualified and then I think five other people that I knew that were qualified.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So some of them were Americans?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They were American. I was probably the only one that wasn&#39;t documented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. So you couldn&#39;t get the scholarship because you weren&#39;t documented.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and then coincidentally enough I got the scholarship and then I was thinking about it because I was going to offer... I was going to ask her to help me, and I&#39;m pretty sure she would have helped me, but then that&#39;s when my dad got deported too. So coincidentally enough, it was right then, so then that went out the window.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m glad you can smile about this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Chuckles] Yeah. I&#39;ve faced all of this for years so I&#39;ve had it a long time to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you didn&#39;t always smile?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, definitely no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you liked school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I very much did. No, I always loved learning and I always wanted to become a scientist, but here, that opportunity is very, very diminished because of the people here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of scientist would you have become?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was always the tough one, because for a while I thought about being a science teacher, but then, I don&#39;t know, maybe just biochemistry, stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And you already knew that in middle school? You liked science so much?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, I was on top of my grades in math and science, but I just really sucked at reading and spelling, and that&#39;s the only thing that gave me a hard time. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Wow. So did you hang out on the streets in Chicago?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say yes. Not that actively like other people there. I mean I knew people that were in gangs and stuff, but it was other people like me where they were gang affiliated, but they wanted away from that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? Explain.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I&rsquo;m pretty sure a lot of people that I used to hang out with, like they had brothers and sisters that were in gangs, but they didn&#39;t want to be in a gang either. So that&#39;s how I see most of my class because strangely enough, most of the people I knew were from first grade up until fifth grade and most people didn&#39;t really move out so we all kind of knew each other. But then since we all kept going along, by the end of the last two years, we all grew together. So I could see that some of my friends had backgrounds of people that were in crime and everything, but they were trying to go away from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you ever get involved in a gang?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Officially, no. But kind of, I mean, I was always around gang members.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that attractive too? Because it seems you&#39;re talking about school and how much you like to learn and then&mdash;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean, was my father&#39;s lifestyle. So it was more of like I saw him as that, but I didn&#39;t really want to be that and he never forced me to want to be that. He always wanted me to get out of that lifestyle too, but he never shied away from showing me the real streets, you can say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow. Okay. So I didn&#39;t interview your dad. So I didn&#39;t know. So your dad was affiliated with gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I mean he never officially was considered a part of one until he got into prison, you can say, but he was always around... We were always around gang members, you know? And even if my dad wasn&#39;t a gang member and people in the streets... Gang members that saw him thought he was so they would throw up gang signs at him and then he just tell me to keep walking and he would have to deal with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know you were undocumented?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For your whole life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I feel like it was kind of normal for me because I never... It wasn&#39;t an issue until that scholarship, but up until then, there was no real problem. Of course, it was in the back of my head if my parents ever got arrested, then that would mean that they would get deported or they would spend in jail longer than others, but that could have been also why... There was stuff that I went through that I couldn&#39;t necessarily tell my parents because they would have to get the law involved and I didn&#39;t want that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was bullied aggressively in Chicago. There was adults and teenagers that would throw rocks at me. Just because&hellip; I was a lot more fatter and uglier.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No seriously, why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s probably it. I never asked why, but they just threw me rocks and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh. So were you a chubby kid?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was. I was very, very big.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So being undocumented, it prevented you from getting the scholarship, did it prevent you from doing other things you wanted to do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not necessarily. I don&#39;t think so, because there wasn&#39;t anything else until then that really needed me to prove my citizenship, especially in Chicago. So&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you want to come back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a lot to process. I thought it was going to be a lot better so back then, yes, but looking at it now, I would have wanted to stay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember what you thought it was going to be like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tell me about that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My father was a different person back then, so he promised that he was going to be a different person once we were over here and he said that there was going to be a lot more opportunities here. So viably, I thought that was the better outcome, but it wasn&#39;t the case.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean he wasn&#39;t a better person here or Mexico wasn&#39;t like-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was a better person in some aspects, but here, definitely there was no better opportunity I would say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember how you imagined Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, no, it never filled my mind knew what this part was going to look like. But then also too, most of the things that I&#39;ve seen on TV and everything were the good side of Mexico. So finally going to the ghetto side of Mexico, I was like, &quot;I mean, it&#39;s not that much different from Chicago.&quot; It&#39;s just the building structures are different and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what&#39;s been the worst part about being back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having less opportunities, I believe. And I guess the social-ness of Mexico is very different from over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, there&#39;s a lot more people like... I&#39;ve been discriminated against because they can see right away that I&#39;m not from here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, because of the way I dress and the way I look, I guess. I don&#39;t look like a typical Mexican, I guess you can say, because ever since I even went to school and everything, everyone&hellip; At first, I wouldn&#39;t talk because I really didn&#39;t know Spanish at all. So I went into school right away not knowing anything so that was hard. So everyone first thought I was mute and I was like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not mute. I just don&#39;t know how to talk that much.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was only one teacher that really understood me and was like&hellip; He never really pressured me. The other ones were like, &quot;Well, you still got to go on the same pace as everyone else.&quot; And then my English teacher, she was a bitch and she used to fail me on purpose because I knew him more than her. The English that they were teaching at that point were kindergarten stuff so I was really good at it and everyone would ask me for help and I would help, but she would sense that and I would get a D or an F and I would be like, &quot;I mean, that doesn&#39;t make sense, but all right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened to being a scientist?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I stopped studying for a really long time so I think that, not damaged, but it did deteriorate some of my learning process. So I mean I still want to become a scientist. It&#39;s just I don&#39;t know if that&#39;s going to be the first option.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re thinking of going back to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, definitely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here or when you go back to the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, definitely because here there&#39;s a lot of job requirements and you have to do high school, at least high school so I I&#39;m going to finish up in high school and then over there [in the US], of course, I&#39;ll finish off and I&#39;ll get a degree.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So why did you drop out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t think I could do it. I didn&#39;t think I could handle all the shit. Some teachers failing me on purpose because they didn&#39;t like me. Me learning more Spanish at the time and stuff like that, and then that I only had one real friend. Other than them, there was nothing really keeping me there. There was no dream that was going to help me from going to school here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still feel the same?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yes. About here? This school system? Yes. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s a structure, at least from over there, not even in the university level. Because here, it&#39;s very different. Like here, in middle school already there was 15/16 classes and that was divided into some. So some days you had all 16, sometimes you had only 12, but it was very&mdash;the schedule was very different. It was longer and different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more Mexican or more American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely more American, but I would say coming back over here did make me have some more understanding of my culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of shitty things here, but there&#39;s no one really helping out no one here. So seeing the people that do try to have a different life than most other people here, I can see that they have it harder than over there, because there&#39;s nothing helping them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you talk about helping them, what are you thinking of?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economically and just support in any way, because here there is structure still I&#39;ll lend you money and stuff, but at a goal of putting you in a lot more debt. So it&#39;s a price to pay. So you are getting out of a hole, you&#39;re just getting into another hole.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of support do you think people who return from the States need here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it varies because some people come over here thinking of making a life here and there&#39;s some that don&#39;t, that want to go back. So I guess it would depend on support here of trying to immigrate to this type of social structure and the people that want to go back, a way back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what kind of help could authorities provide here, for example, that would help you have a different experience from the one you&#39;ve had that would help people integrate and find a place in the society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Gustavo:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I guess just having programs of people that have already experienced everything help others that are just freshly coming here, teaching them the ways of how people are here.
