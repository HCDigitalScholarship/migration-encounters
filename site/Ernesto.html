It&#39;s very important.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re trying, we&#39;re trying, but it&#39;s really important for people to hear your stories, and I know it might be painful. So, I&#39;m sorry for this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, Ernesto, or EGama3, I didn&#39;t hear any of your survey, so tell me how old were you when you came to the US.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was around seven, eight years old, when I left to the States. It was just my dad&#39;s decision to get a better life. He used to be a cop here in Mexico, so I&#39;m guessing he didn&#39;t like the lifestyle or something like that, so that was his main reason to go to the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he escaping any sorts of violence or criminal activity, do you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, not criminal activity-wise. He was a good cop. I&#39;m guessing he felt that he didn&#39;t want us in that type of lifestyle, because most of my family on my dad&#39;s sides have been cops, so I&#39;m guessing he didn&#39;t want that for us, and one of the main reasons why he took us to the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were seven or eight. Had you been to school here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was in school. I&#39;m guessing it was elementary or kindergarten or something like that, but yeah, I remember being in school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember the actual trip to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, I mean I remember how we crossed the river because I mean that was pretty much how we entered the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you cross the river? Was it a boat?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was one of the tire things that go inside. They put three of us ... It was me and my other two brothers and they just pulled us from one side to the other.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Could you swim?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think so. I was trying to reach the floor but I wasn&#39;t able to touch it, so I&#39;m guessing it was pretty deep. I&#39;m guessing there was a current to it. You really did need the floatable thing that they had.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first few days in the States? Do you know what it was like? Did it seem different or was it ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We arrived in Texas. Even though we were with some of my dad&#39;s friends, it did feel weird. It doesn&#39;t feel like home. Everything&#39;s new. Even the streets were new. It was pretty different, yeah. It took me a while to adapt to it, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you feel like you were leaving friends, relatives? Was there a sense that you were leaving people behind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, my uncles, my grandpa, all the people. I did feel like, &quot;Well, why can&#39;t they come with us?&quot; I guess it&#39;s part of life&#39;s teaching, so I just guess you deal with it pretty well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what time of year was it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm, I would say it was October because my birthday was a month or something after we crossed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you started school immediately?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it took us six months til my dad got his things figured out and then, yeah, he took us to school, started elementary school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Texas?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative), in Texas, because we were just there for like a year. After that I guess my dad didn&#39;t like it and took us to Atlanta, so that was where pretty much I had most of my life here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what do you remember about school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was pretty nice. Nothing compared to like here in Mexico. You eat your breakfast, school bus goes and picks you up. That was pretty new for me. Yeah, I actually did like going to school and all that. It was pretty nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you had two brothers? Older or younger?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re younger. They&#39;re younger, and my sister. I have a sister too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Younger?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, also younger.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they all came with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, everybody. We all took the same trip. My little brother&#39;s back with me here in Mexico now. He also got deported three years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re growing up in the States. You&#39;ve got a crew of kids in your household. Did you make friends easily?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Texas I did because there was a lot of Hispanic people, so you could talk to them. It wasn&#39;t that complicated, but when I moved to Atlanta, I did kind of struggle there. I didn&#39;t know how to speak English. It still was taking me a while. So kind of didn&#39;t socialize that much until my English started fluent. I started talking more and more, but in the beginning it did cost me a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It took me a year, definitely. It was a year until I actually was talking in class.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And was there anything about school that was especially good or especially bad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think a lot of things were good. We did have a special teacher helping us, like all the Spanish kids that didn&#39;t know English. They helped us with our homework, keeping up with class. I thought it was pretty nice. I had a bit of help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your parents, what do they do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad started working at a company, they make glass for perfumes and all that, so that&#39;s where he worked at. I mean, he still works there many times, so&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. How about your mom? Who is she?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was working there also. She doesn&#39;t work anymore, she just stays home. But yeah, she used to work there as well, at the glass company.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was that hard for you guys, if your parents were both working?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span><span>.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;</span><span>T</span><span class="c2">here would be a period of 12 hours where we didn&#39;t see them at all, so we had to get up early, take the bus. If we missed the bus, we had to walk to school, so pretty much we tried to, you know&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How far was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walking to school was like a 25 minute walk. So yeah, we were trying hard not to miss the bus. We would just get up, get ready, catch the bus. Once in school, like, okay, you catch your practice, start school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you get home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), get home. Your parents still aren&#39;t home, so make something to eat for everybody, make sure everybody&#39;s doing their homework.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were in charge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At age eight or nine?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eight or nine.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you do well in school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was just like ... I mean, my parents would be home around 6:00, so they took over after that and they didn&#39;t stop me from doing my things back in school. I was also in sports after they had more time in the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you enjoy the sports?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. I played soccer. I was on varsity team, and then I started track. I tried football but that wasn&#39;t my thing, so just stuck with track. That was it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you started after-school activities at some point.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you feel responsible for your younger siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, in the beginning I did because Dad has to work, Mom has to work, I&rsquo;m the oldest one, so got to take care of the kids. Especially when you&#39;re getting used to everything, so that was a challenge. Once you grow older it&#39;s just like, oh, okay, your schedule has a routine and you&#39;re okay and keep with it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you all speak English in the house or did you speak Spanish?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in the house it was fully Spanish. Me and my dad didn&#39;t speak Spanish. My mom spoke fluent English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh she did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah she did. So my dad was like, &quot;No English in the house.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did she learn it when she went to the States or did she already know English?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she had already taken some courses here in Mexico and I&#39;m guessing being in the States helped her develop her pronunciation and all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how long did you go to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For like 10 years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you finish high school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I finished high school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said you played varsity soccer and track?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And track. Yeah, I was on track team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what? Did you think about college?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but I mean, before I could even walk to get my diploma and all that, that&#39;s when I got deported. I got pulled over driving without a license and that was my ... the cost for me to be back here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, in Georgia, you can&#39;t get a license without ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social security number, I guess. My dad gave me a car because he knew I needed it, so I was driving ... I knew if it&#39;s red, you stop, trying to follow every single rules not to mess up. I guess this day I didn&#39;t or something happened and I got pulled over. He asked me for my license. I told him I didn&#39;t have it and he just took me in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 18.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What month? Right before graduation, you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that was before my high school graduation. I really came within a month.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&#39;d finished up and you were ready to graduate?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was just the ceremony.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. So you had a car and you tried your best to not get stopped. Do you remember what you did wrong to get pulled over?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he said I took a turn where I wasn&#39;t supposed to. I mean, I didn&rsquo;t consider&hellip; I lived around there so I pretty much knew every single turn that you couldn&#39;t do and that was what he said, so I don&#39;t know what I did wrong. So I was just like, &quot;Okay.&quot; If I argue, I might end up losing myself, so I just stayed quiet and waited until I got in contact with my dad and asked him what is there to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you been scared of the authorities before then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before then, I really didn&#39;t interact with them, but the ones you see at school, but that was pretty much the only interaction I ever had with a cop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your parents, do they have licenses or green cards or not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad does. I don&#39;t know how he got his but he has a driver&#39;s license.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he didn&#39;t at the time or he did at the time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As far as I know, he&#39;s always had it, because before he took us to the States, he was already living there. He was there for two years before we got there with him, so he had all that stuff settled. Us, we couldn&#39;t get it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you get pulled over by the cops. Had you been involved with gangs or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. My dad was pretty strict. I mean, he was a cop, so everything he said had to be. So that&#39;s why we tried not to get in trouble, tried to be involved in school, just to not be at home just thinking about other things. Just keep my mind busy on something good is what helped.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have friends from all different nationalities and socioeconomic groups?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you felt like you were integrated?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative), yeah, definitely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what were your favorite things about living in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me&mdash;commodity, luxury. Some things you do miss from Mexico, but over there is completely different. I mean, the culture, the people, everybody, we can say they mind their own business, and over here it&#39;s completely different. That&#39;s, I don&#39;t know, lifestyle I guess. That&#39;s what I pretty much miss from the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you got picked up, did you try to fight it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, I just tell them I didn&rsquo;t have my driver&#39;s license and he just told me to step out of the car.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in terms of like being deported, did you try and fight that? The deportation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t know if my dad didn&#39;t know what to do but he was just like, just, &ldquo;Don&#39;t do nothing. If they ask you if you want to sign your voluntary departure, go ahead and sign it.&quot; That was one of the options, so I was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;ll sign my voluntary departure.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So were you detained at all?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was detained for six months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six months?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was in a detention center, Stewart Detention Center in Georgia. I was there for six months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me it was like being in prison. You had your cell, you were with somebody else. They were pretty strict about the times and all that. Even though they had us separated by colors, it was like, &quot;Oh, I can&#39;t really go over there because they&#39;re red and they&#39;re killers. They may do something to me because I haven&#39;t done anything.&quot; But yeah, it was very scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were the guards nice to you or not?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not all of them. Some of them were but the others, most of them were pretty ... they would make fun of you. They&#39;ll bully you in any way that they could.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your parents come visit you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They were afraid that if they would go there, they would get caught, so no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your siblings, no one?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no. Nobody.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s lonely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was scared. It was a first-time experience that everything, the people, just waking up every day was a new challenge, a new thing to do. It&#39;s like, &quot;What am I doing here? Why can&#39;t I just go home?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Before that happened, had you thought about going to college?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, definitely. I was going to find a way to keep going with my education, but I never expected to be back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re in detention for six months. Why six months? Just waiting for your trial or a judge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just waiting for something to bring me back. I exactly didn&#39;t know what they were waiting for. Every time I would ask, they would be like, &quot;Oh, we&#39;ll get back to you next time,&quot; and that was pretty much the answer every single time. So one day they said my name. I remember, because it was in December and I got back here December 15, so when they said my name, I just jumped. &quot;Okay, he&#39;s taking me back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you see a judge at that point when they said your name? Did they bring you before a judge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, they didn&#39;t bring me ... That was just before they took me to the detention center where I saw the judge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before you went to the detention center, you saw the judge?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you signed the voluntary departure?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that was ... Well, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s where the process started because I signed my voluntary departure, it&#39;s like three months after when I was in the detention center.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have a lawyer or anything?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. There was somebody standing there but he said there was nothing I could do and since I wasn&#39;t going to fight the case, I&#39;m guessing that&#39;s why he didn&#39;t say anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s crazy that you&#39;d have to sit there for six months ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... if they knew you were going to just go on your own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I don&#39;t know. I&#39;m guessing they were getting all the&hellip; gathering people together and making one trip, I don&#39;t know what was their idea.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like someone&#39;s trying to make money ... So, they call your name and they just ... Do you get on a bus? What happens?</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, from a bus, they took us to an airport and then from there, they flew us to Texas. On Texas, they just opened right on the border they opened the gate and they were like, &quot;Welcome to Mexico.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you scared?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean no, no, it was tough. All you saw was people offering you money, like, &quot;Hey, you want to trade your dollars? Hey, you want to trade your dollars?&quot; I hadn&#39;t even seen Mexican pesos. I mean, to me, they&#39;re like plastic but I didn&#39;t know that, so I was like, &quot;That seems fake, seems sketchy.&quot; So I just kept my dollars and went to a pharmacy, bought some aspirin and I paid with the dollars. That&#39;s why I got the pesos, and then I just called my dad. I was like, &quot;Well, I&#39;m here. What can I do?&quot; Nothing. He just sent me more money so I can get a bus to come to Mexico City, and that&#39;s what I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had to stay at a house for refugees. There was like a house-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A shelter?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative), for all the deportees. But there was a lot of people in there. You could barely sleep. That&#39;s where I spent the night until I could get the money and just get the bus ticket and come to the city.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your life in the US was sort of a normal middle class life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You had a nice house, three siblings, parents. Suddenly you&#39;re just six months in a detention center and then ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then back here in Mexico with nothing. I mean, my dad had a house, but ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Had you been to Mexico and visited Mexico since you left?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, mm-mm (negative). No, I was a kid. I remember a few stuff, but I didn&#39;t know. I didn&#39;t move around. I didn&#39;t know all the dangers that are here. I mean, I&#39;ve been here for eight years now, so now the way I see it, it&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, it&#39;s just part of Mexico City,&quot; you know? I&#39;m kind of used to it now. But when I first got here, yeah, it was scary. Getting back with the people, with society here&hellip; I don&#39;t know, people are harsh. People are harsh.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did your dad ... you said he had a house here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he had a house here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What had been happening to it in the last-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nothing, it was just there, abandoned for 10 years that I was over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you moved in?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I moved in. I had to clean everything. It wasn&#39;t the best thing, but thank God I had a shelter, so I just cleaned everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still living in it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, right now we&#39;re building ... My brother and I, we&#39;re building and we&#39;re almost done with the first floor, so that&#39;s a big come up since I got here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said you had left uncles and grandparents when you left at seven. Did you reunite with them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my grandparents were&hellip; they passed away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They passed away?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, never got to be with them again. My uncles, yeah. They were here, but I don&#39;t know, it changed because we weren&#39;t so close no more. Everybody was just doing their own thing and some of them wanted to take advantage because they knew my dad was helping me with money, so they were like, &quot;Oh, he has money.&quot; They all make me pay for things. As you grow up, you&#39;re like, &quot;Well, this ain&#39;t right, so come on, people.&quot; It changed the perspective I had with my family. I don&#39;t talk to a few of them no more, and the ones I do is just not regular, every now and then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you get to Mexico, you get to this dilapidated house, you start to sort of reconnect with uncles. Did you get a job? What did you do? Did you think about going back to school? What did you do? Did you have papers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when I was here, when I first got here, my auntie, she helped me out with a job. They have money, so they were able to do things without asking for papers or anything like that. So they gave me a job. I mean, they were really strict on me, so I didn&#39;t like the job. I didn&#39;t want to live with them because-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of job?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inaudible 00:22:35] I was taking care of paperwork for a company. &quot;You do this, you do...&quot; They would give me this whole folder full of papers and I had to put everything in order. That was pretty much everything I did. I wasn&#39;t learning anything. I was just going to be stuck there because I really couldn&#39;t move up. So that&#39;s why I didn&#39;t like it. I told them I want to get out and I got out, and that&#39;s when I started working at the call centers. I think I&#39;ve worked in every single one of them now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do you move between call centers?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">.Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of them, they do some sketchy things and ... because I&#39;ve been moving around, too ... I used to live in Guadalajara too, I used to live in Canc&uacute;n.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So me moving around, like every time I came back from Mexico, the easiest job to get was a call center, so that&#39;s where I will go back to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why do you move around?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get to know Mexico. I was here by myself at that time, so I didn&#39;t have anything else to do. So I wanted to meet Mexico. I wanted to know what I was missing. The States was nice. My dad took us to a lot of places. I really got to know pretty much half of the States. That&#39;s what I wanted to do here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you traveled a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a kid.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That was pretty good. My dad, even though he worked a lot, they used to give him a week off every two, three months and he would take that week just to take us somewhere. I pretty got like stuck to that, so when I came to Mexico, I was like, &quot;Well, I was born here and I don&#39;t know nothing about this place.&quot; So that&#39;s what took me to live in Guadalajara, Guanajuato, to Cancun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;d go and work there for a while.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I worked in Guadalajara. There&#39;s call centers as well. In Canc&uacute;n, I worked in the hotels. I think Canc&uacute;n was one of the best experiences because it&#39;s like a little America. There&#39;s a lot of people from the States. A lot, a lot. There was always something new.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So why&#39;d you come back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too much partying, it wears you out. Also, high season, it&#39;s awesome. Low season, it&#39;s not so good. And also with the cartel things and the drug trafficking, there was a point where Canc</span><span>&uacute;</span><span class="c2">n was the hot zone. I didn&#39;t like that, so I came back over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you feel less safe there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, there was a point where you couldn&#39;t even walk out at a certain time because somebody will pick you up and search you to see who you were and why you were walking out, and it&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, I live here.&quot; Yeah, it was kind of scary, so after a couple of things that happened, I was just like, &quot;No, I have to go back to Mexico.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You say it&#39;s been eight years since you&#39;ve been back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you left your auntie and started the call centers, and the hospitality industry&hellip; Do you think you&#39;ll stay in Mexico City now for a while?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, I&#39;ll definitely stay here. Right now there&#39;s something called Hola Code.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I know. You&rsquo;re taking courses?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m almost ... we get graduated on June 15, so hopefully this will help me out with a technical career instead of working at call centers. I don&#39;t want to speak bad about call centers because I&#39;ve got a lot from them experience-wise, money. It was good but if I can do better, why not? So that&#39;s why.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. We&#39;re going to go to Hola Code and interview some people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wonderful, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s been a good experience.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Also I found that because of New Comienzos so I&#39;ve been a volunteer for two years almost.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They&rsquo;ve helped a lot. I took the interpreter test. That&#39;s when I saw you and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I got that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has that worked? Has there been any ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;ve had a couple just between friends, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything&#39;s an opportunity.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And with Hola Code, do they guarantee you a job at graduation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I would say it mostly depends on you, how much time, effort and dedication you put to it, because if you didn&#39;t learn much at the time of the interview, you&#39;re the one who has to take the interview. I mean, Hola Code does have a lot of hiring partners. That&#39;s the really cool thing, so it just depends on your effort and what you learned for you to pass the interview, because they do have really good jobs. I know a lot of people that already graduated and they&#39;re making 35, 42,000 a month, which is a real come up from working for the call centers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. And you said your brother&#39;s back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Three years ago he also got deported and he came over here. He was a baby so pretty much he had it easy. My dad, somehow he paid for him to be from the States delivered exactly in Mexico City, so I just picked him up at the airport and just took him home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it a similar situation to yours?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, my brother was a little bit more reckless. It was a DUI, driving under the influence.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And voluntary departure?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, same thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re living together?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And building the house?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we&#39;re almost done with the first floor, so that was an accomplishment. We were like, &quot;Oh, we&#39;ve just got one more room to go.&quot; We celebrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know how to do this construction work?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no, we paid somebody to take care of that. I mean, I wish I knew. We would have saved a lot of money till then but yeah, we had to look for somebody that we could trust. Like, &quot;Okay, this is what we want.&quot; My brother and I have just been working, putting the money into the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great, and is he at a call center too?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how about social life?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s still getting used to ... I was seven years old when I went to the States. He was a little one, so everything was ... He got more accommodated to the States because I remember Mexico. I remember pretty much how it was, but he didn&#39;t, so to him it&#39;s like a lot harder to get used to all this. So there&#39;s times where he still don&#39;t talk to people. He&#39;s in his little bubble. He does want to go back and just stay in the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you&#39;re more committed to staying here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;ve been here a long time, so I love Mexico. I also love the States. I learned a lot, but I already lived there, I already lived here, and if I ever move somewhere else, I&#39;ll move to Europe to know what I&#39;m missing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a girlfriend?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&hellip;family? What are you ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I have a girlfriend. I met her while I was going to Hola Code. She&#39;s from Colombia, so everything&#39;s working out well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see a future here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I definitely do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to be a programmer. I want to be able to build things. That&#39;s why I started Hola Code, and hopefully that will take me places.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were your dreams in the US, or did you have dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, back in ... Most of my dream was just going to college and having a career, or pretty much just getting to college because...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the dreams are similar?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I would say. I mean, I guess everything just depends on you and just to be the positive out of the situation. I can go back, but I don&#39;t want to go back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what is the deal with you going back? Is there a time limit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. The time limit was two years, which I&#39;m way over the two years. I&#39;ve never applied to go back or anything like that. I pretty much like Mexico. If you know things, you can find a way out. New Comienzos is doing a lot for me, so if there&#39;s an opportunity there, I&#39;m going to take it and just make the best out of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But what about seeing your family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean one day I&#39;ll get ... once I have more money, I guess I&#39;ll take care of that and just go see my parents. We see each other on Skype pretty much every day. They&#39;re okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really? That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re happy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your siblings too?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we keep in touch every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing. That&#39;s good. That&#39;s a lot of support for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, it&#39;s pretty much all you need to keep going, because you do get depressed once you&#39;re new here and you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. So having them ... always know that you can pick up the phone and call them, it&#39;s a plus.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does your brother have more of a penalty in terms of when he can go back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, five years. He&#39;s waiting for two more, so he can try to start the process.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And will they let him?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sort of depends on what the legal situation, too, in the US ...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I don&#39;t know. With Trump&#39;s administration, I really don&#39;t think so. He wants to give it a try.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great he has you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s the only thing I can do, support. As long as it ain&#39;t bad, I&#39;ll go ahead and support him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, sort of an interesting question. You were in the States for 11 years and your time in ... So that&#39;s 11 out of ... How old are you now? 26?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So 11 out of your 26 years, so half of your life you&#39;ve been in Mexico. Did the 11 years in the United States make you a different person than you would have been?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so how?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like if I would have stayed here in Mexico, I don&#39;t know, I guess that would have been ... First of all, I wouldn&#39;t have known English, so I wouldn&#39;t have all that experience of traveling and being places. I probably would be working towards being a cop.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like your dad.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not bad, but down here in Mexico, I don&#39;t like that. So yeah, I guess it changed my whole destiny because being in the States made me like school, so that&#39;s why I pretty much ... I was always reading or studying something, and when I got here, it was just like, &quot;Okay, New Comienzos has this thing going on. I might as well just take care of it, that way I can always be more.&quot; Bill Gates created his own software. I could probably do that as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about volunteering?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been in New Comienzos. Also I&#39;m a </span><span class="c3 c6">brigadista</span><span class="c2">. You know how there&#39;s earthquakes here in Mexico. So I have two classes to rescue people. When the earthquake on September 19 happened, I was helping getting the people out. I took Red Cross classes and all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s great. Do you think you would have engaged in those kind of activities if you&#39;d never gone to the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I think so. I&#39;ve always liked helping people. I don&#39;t think that would have changed, regardless.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. Amazing. Well, so, I&#39;m just about finishing. Is there anything in particular you&#39;d like people to hear about returning migrants or about the whole process of immigration and coming back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It really is a harsh process why they do it that way. I don&#39;t understand why ... pretty much they hurt a lot of people separating a lot of families. It&#39;s not like I was doing something bad. They could check everything. I was a good kid. I didn&#39;t see no reason why I have to be back, but whatever happens to the situation is ... you can always come out of the hole, so just keep pushing through.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you very much. I feel very optimistic. So do you.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.30j0zll"><span class="c2">Ernesto:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c2"></span></p></body></html>
