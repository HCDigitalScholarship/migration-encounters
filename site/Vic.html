Hi Vic, thanks for joining us. So first of all, I want to thank you so much for your time and everything that you&#39;re going to share with us today. We know that it can be really difficult to kind of share some of these stories and remember things that might not have been as pleasant, but the stories that you share and everything that you&#39;ve been through is really going to help us uncover some things that we could do better, and hopefully provide better recommendations on how to improve the situation. It&#39;s not just for you, but for other people going through the same thing. So really thank you for that, and thanks for your time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the first question we have here is why did your family migrate to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a better future. They see no future in Mexico, so they wanted to go set something better for me and my sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leaving, when your family left, what did you guys leave behind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they left all their family behind. They went to somewhere that they had no clue what the regulations and rules were, so it was pretty hard for them to start with. I mean, they grew up all their life right here. And to go to somewhere where they had no one, I mean I think that&#39;s pretty... They left behind a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you first got to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About </span><span>to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;be two years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years old, okay. What&#39;s your first memory of the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, when my parents got their first apartment. But I mean, I was really little, so I don&#39;t remember much when I got there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How about the first memory that you have, that you say, &quot;Oh yeah, I remember this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, it must have been when we got our first apartment. Because everything else was struggling in the beginning, until they got their apartment, that&#39;s when everything got better. I think that&#39;s why that&#39;s the only memory that stands out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you go to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I went to kindergarten. Well, preschool and then kindergarten. And then I graduated high school and all that, and I had to start working but on my own, once I graduated, because financially, we were unstable and stuff. So I just had to find ends meet through my part.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you were going to school, do you remember any teachers or friends that you went to school with?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I actually kept in touch with one of my teachers from fifth grade, and then I still keep in touch with friends, even though I&#39;m over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there ever a moment that you realized, &quot;Oh hey, I&#39;m undocumented?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. When my friends were going to Sea World and stuff, and then my parents would tell me, &quot;No, you might get stopped.&quot; And I was 10 years old, so I didn&#39;t really know what was going on. So I just had to understand in my way of form, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard. Not to be able to join a soccer team because they travel. Like I would meet qualifications and stuff to be on the certain soccer team, but I couldn&#39;t be in that team because they traveled through airplane and stuff, so it was really hard. I couldn&#39;t do things that other people could have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were really good at soccer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you play in high school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What position?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Midfield.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you ever get any high school awards for it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Once I got high school, my mind was on something else because my parents separated during high school, so I had to take care of my sister on my own and that&#39;s when my focus on school was fading away, and more into financial like stability. So I was looking more into jobs and stuff. By the time I reached the junior high, I was already asking my dad if I could help him out or someone else for extra money.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when your parents split up, what happened?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was hard because I can imagine, my parents got here, they were struggling, and at the point that they separated, I really like understood that we were undocumented so I was just like, what is my dad going to do? What is my mom going to do? They&#39;re two undocumented people in like this big world and I really didn&#39;t know what to understand of it, what was going to come from it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So where did they go after they split?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad rented his own room and we rented an apartment. So we stayed in the same city but different homes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you had to&mdash;you said&mdash;be the one to take care of your sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your sister a US citizen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like to have... You were having to be the person to step into </span><span>that</span><span class="c0">?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was big shoes to fill because the only thing I knew how to make was mac and cheese or rice and stuff or cereal, but that&#39;s why it was really hard. And then I had to focus on making sure </span><span>she did</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;her homework and then sometimes I would lose focus about my homework. So yeah, it was hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like</span><span>&hellip; </span><span class="c0">Yeah. How did it feel when other people that were the same as you were going on these soccer trips and being documented? Did that affect the way that you wanted to compete and how competitive you were?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah, because they would tell me, &quot;Let&#39;s go to Arizona, let&#39;s go to Miami.&quot; And then I&#39;d be like, &quot;How am I going to do this?&quot; I would talk to my mom and she&#39;d tell me, &quot;You just have to tell them you have family issues or something.&rdquo; So that&rsquo;s why I couldn&rsquo;t. My mindset wasn&#39;t always at the greatest point that it could be. When I was little, yeah, because I&#39;m a little kid, I don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on. But once I started realizing there&#39;s more opportunity, more doors could be open, then that&#39;s when you start getting shut down because you don&#39;t have the rights to do this or that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did any of your friends know you were undocumented?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just a couple, </span><span>I mean </span><span class="c0">very few. Only like two.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So before you found out, what did you want to be in life?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I always looked into architecture. So engineering and stuff. I mean I think that&#39;s really cool. That&#39;s what I wanted to study. I was actually trying to go to a trade school for machinery, and then work my way into architecture and stuff, but I couldn&#39;t do it because my social security wasn&#39;t going through and that was through DACA. So once I hit that point, I was like, &quot;Man. What am I really going to do for myself? I&#39;d rather just start working and find my ends meet through some other way.&quot; But I really did want to keep studying after I graduated high school because there&#39;s nothing good that comes out of life if you don&#39;t study after that. And especially for someone like me, that&#39;s coming from a low end family, it&#39;s really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You also had to take good care of your sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. I was just focused more on money, but there&#39;s no way of really making money because I couldn&#39;t go to school, I couldn&#39;t get this decent job because I didn&#39;t have certain scholarships or stuff like that. That&#39;s why I really was focused into going to college right after that, but if a trades school wasn&#39;t accepting me, then what made me think a community college was going to accept me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, one thing I was really surprised about is that you had, as an undocumented person, had to take care of a US citizen sister.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And step into that role. I don&#39;t think that would have been easy. Did you ever think about that? Like, &quot;Wow, why is the system treating me like this if I have my US citizen sister?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I mean, not really, because at the time, I wasn&#39;t really focused on too much things like that. Yeah, life isn&#39;t fair but it&#39;s unfair for a lot of people. I&#39;m not just going to put my case out there just because I didn&#39;t have papers. A lot of people don&#39;t have papers or documentation and they still make it in life. So that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t really focused on little things like that. Those things just put you down, at the end of the day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever feel that was unfair for your sister?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I mean yeah, because she&#39;s watching us struggle. At this point, she doesn&#39;t even know what to do in life. She studies and stuff, but her brother&#39;s in one place that she grew up with, and then her parents are in a different place where they&#39;re crying their eyes out, not knowing what to do, if their baby is going to be safe the next day. You know what I mean? Like I said, there&#39;s a lot of struggles and it&#39;s hardship a lot in Mexico. So, </span><span>t</span><span class="c0">hey worry a lot. They&#39;re on my phone every single day. They call me nonstop just to make sure I&#39;m okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You worked in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your favorite job there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think working mechanic with my dad. I think that was the best part. I like hands on work. Customer service is fun, but when you got customers yelling at you and stuff, just because they paid extra money for something that they did buy, it&#39;s hard. That&#39;s why Walmart, I wasn&#39;t really too much into it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you want to work there as an auto?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. What kind of cars would you work on?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my dad, whatever cars came in. Nissans, Fords. Nothing luxurious. You know? The most luxurious was my dad&#39;s Mercedes, but that&#39;s pretty much all we got luxury and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your favorite fix? Like, when the car came in with a problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t really get that much training. I only worked with him for a year, but it was probably changing the oil. The simple things. You know? But watching my dad undo a whole engine, that surprised me because all the pieces that it carries inside.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your least favorite thing about the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The racism. That&#39;s pretty much it. The racism. I mean, you got black that hate Mexicans, Mexicans that hate white, white that hate black and it just never ends. It&#39;s not fair for no one. How are you supposed to live safe or calm if you&#39;re going to have hatred like that all over you go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you experience any discrimination in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. I didn&#39;t tend to stand out a lot. Going to high school, no one&#39;s really going to put me out there because my English is as good as theirs. That&#39;s why they&#39;re not going to put... I&#39;ve seen other people put down people that just came to the US. I&#39;ve seen that, but it hurts, but there&#39;s not much I could do. I&#39;m not going to risk my high school career just to get suspended because some guy was getting talked down to. Which I wish I did do something, but at the end of the day, it&rsquo;s not&hellip; it&rsquo;s really not worth it. You could just talk to that person afterwards and</span><span>&nbsp;let him know</span><span class="c0">, &quot;I know things are rough, but keep your head up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there anything that you ever wanted to do that you couldn&#39;t because of your status?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Study. I really wanted to get into studying, but for some reason, that&#39;s what tripped me out. I tried getting into a trades school and they wouldn&#39;t let me get in there for some reason. Just because of my social security. I mean I thought that because I had the DACA, that meant I had a good social security status. That&#39;s what bummed me out. That&#39;s why afterwards, I didn&#39;t even look into community college and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after that moment, how did you end up in Mexico? How did you end up back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got deported and then... I mean, it all happened so unexpected. The first thing I did was get a hotel right there in TJ, and then I came all over here because my grandparents were here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened on the US side that night that you got caught by police? What were you doing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I was driving under the influence of alcohol.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But before. Like how&rsquo;d you get drunk? Who were you drinking with?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it was just with some friends. And then I remember some girl just got her apartment and then we said let&#39;s go over there, and I guess we were supposed to crash there and I didn&#39;t want to crash there, I&#39;d rather go home. After that, once fresh air hit me, I guess that&#39;s when my liquor hits, got to the fullest, and I blurred out. And I was driving recklessly on the freeway. I didn&#39;t get pulled over, exiting the freeway, I actually crashed. No one got hurt or anything, but the axles on the car actually broke, so I had nowhere to go. But luckily, I was by myself and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were at a housewarming party that night?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everyone else that was there, were they US citizens or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;ve never really hung out with people that were undocumented. No one really throws their status out there. &quot;Hey look, I&#39;m undocumented.&quot; No one actually says that. It&#39;s really hard to point them out. There&#39;s people that don&#39;t understand English or speak it very not fluent, so that&#39;s the only reason you can tell, &quot;Oh, this guy&#39;s been in Mexico for a while.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they know you were undocumented?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, they didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s something me and my family always left as, you know, don&#39;t let that bother you, don&#39;t let no one know, it&#39;s not their business and stuff. It was that type of thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after you were caught by police, then...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They gave me a breathalyzer and then they took me in. They actually let me out the next morning. Or I believe it was the next night, they actually let me out and then they told me, &quot;Here, you have to present yourself to this courthouse and stuff and we&#39;re going to settle things in court.&quot; I was like, okay. After that, everything went fine. And that&#39;s when I got my second DUI and that&#39;s when everything got under the radar, and once I went to one of my court cases and they actually took me in, and they told me that I was get taken in by customs of ICE...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened to your second DUI?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same thing. Just driving drunk and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a friend?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At a friend&#39;s place?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I was with my girlfriend. We were coming back from the movies and stuff. And for some reason, I don&#39;t know what happened, the car just slid to the right and then just flipped. But we weren&#39;t doing nothing, we were literally just driving but since we had the bottle in the car, they didn&#39;t even take me in that day because I wasn&#39;t even drunk, I had more of a smell of liquor than actual drunk, because they took my breathalyzer and stuff, but since I was driving drunk and the car flipped, that&#39;s the reason they pulled us over and stuff. Because they didn&#39;t take no one in, they didn&#39;t take me or my ex-girlfriend in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they stopped you guys?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They charged you with a DUI?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a second DUI.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you went to court?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they took me to court and then that&#39;s when I had more cases... I just had finished my first DUI, paying everything and stuff, so it was perfectly fine until... And then we came back from the movies and they took me to court once again, and that&#39;s when I kept showing up to court, it was little by little, I guess the system picked me up as undocumented. It keeps coming up in court, what&#39;s going on, and that&#39;s when Immigration was really tough. One DUI, yes, I understand they&#39;ll forgive you, but the second DUI, that&#39;s really difficult to get out of. Especially when it comes to driving drunk, because you&#39;re putting other people&#39;s life in danger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that was a year and a half ago?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No, actually, it was like two and a half years ago.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened after you got caught and they put you in the system? How&#39;d you end up with ICE?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess they just hand me over. They picked up my case. Like I mentioned, I probably picked up the radar in the system or something and then ICE said, &quot;Go for this guy, he has a court case right now, so just come pick him up.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they picked you up in the state court?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the state court, it was the city court.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where at?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;____. No, I believe it was ____. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they showed up to city court in _____, and how did they pick you up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was already in handcuffs and stuff and they told me, &quot;Alright, you&#39;re going to be released.&quot; Well, usually when you&#39;re released in city court, they release you with everyone and this one came as a surprise, that I was being brought out by myself, and they put my hands behind my back and they handcuffed me and stuff, and when I walked out, I actually seen the car of ICE, the ICE truck. So I was like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c3">damn.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And the first thing that came to mind was run, but I mean where am I going to run to? I might run to hug my mom and say goodbye, but that&#39;s not something I&#39;d be able to do because I&#39;m not going to go on the run forever either. That&#39;s not a way to live. I messed up so I&#39;d rather own up to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was </span><span>____</span><span class="c0">a sanctuary city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sanctuary city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s weird. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I don&#39;t remember, it was </span><span>___</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In California?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, in California, in the same city area.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from DUI&#39;s, were you involved in any other crimes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a vandalism case. I was just walking through the train tracks and they picked me up and stuff. I had a black backpack and they thought I was out there doing, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graffiti? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, something. I was like, what&#39;s going on? I don&#39;t even have things on me. And they got me for vandalism. He was like, &quot;You can&#39;t be crossing right here.&quot; I&#39;m like, &ldquo;Dude, it&#39;s city property. I can be walking wherever I want, so I&#39;m not trespassing on some people&#39;s property, I&#39;m just walking in the railroad tracks,&rdquo; and he just got me for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aside from that, there&#39;s nothing else? When you were taken to ICE, how long were you in detention for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Year and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and a half?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A year and months, yeah. A year and months or a year and three months or a year and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was the facility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility was cool, the food was bad. They even had a protest in there about the food. But besides everything else, I mean, they give you sweaters, they give you the clothes that you need, the food was the only thing that was bad, but you got big screen TV&#39;s to watch all day. You&#39;re not locked up all day, you&#39;re actually outside working out or doing whatever you want. You&#39;re just locked up, you&#39;re being detained. You&#39;re in detention, but other than that...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you treated well?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. There wasn&#39;t that much discrimination. The people were nice. The workers, they were working through college. It was people in college, they were young so they understood us. They really didn&#39;t mind us that much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So there was other people your age?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there was people my age, there was people that were 18, there was people that were 40, but I mean I&#39;m talking about the workers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The facility?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were college&hellip; ?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they were college graduates or getting their degrees and stuff. So that&#39;s what actually surprised me. There weren&#39;t actual police people there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were there a year and a half to fight your case?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what ended up happening for your eventual deportation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that morning they woke me up, at night, I was going to make a phone call to see that my mom had the lawyer stuff all worked out and stuff, and my call wasn&#39;t going through. And this was a Sunday night. The only time that your call doesn&#39;t go through on a Sunday night is because people are getting deported the next day and they&#39;re taking people out of the system. And I actually went to go check out if my status was still in the system and it wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your A number?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your A number?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t remember that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Don&#39;t remember?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>____</span><span class="c0">. Something like that. But no, it&#39;s ____</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember the UIR number?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that you had, the 1-800?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that one I don&#39;t remember, but yeah, I remember my A number. But yeah, I went to check my commissary money and stuff and when I brought that up, it wasn&#39;t allowing me, so that&#39;s the only reason I knew I was getting deported the next morning. And I actually had a bond case the next morning and I had the following day, my actual hearing for my case. And they woke me up at like six in the morning telling me to wrap it up, get your stuff and we&#39;re going.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What year was it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;2017. 2018.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think it had anything with Trump?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hm?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that had anything to do with Trump?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean, it has to do with all government. They&#39;re all into this. They&#39;re trying to benefit deporting people to get more money into the States. You have</span><span>&nbsp;immigrant </span><span class="c3">people making people&#39;s money in the US that I don&#39;t think they like that at all. I understand, but still, we&#39;re there just to work. We&#39;re not there to cause trouble. I understand we all come from different parts of the world, we all come from different groups, different status. Like poor, rich, wealthy, whatever. But it doesn&#39;t mean we all got to get that same image of us, that we&#39;re drug dealers, that we&#39;re gangsters and stuff. I really don&#39;t appreciate that, but I understand he&#39;s trying to protect </span><span class="c3 c8">his </span><span class="c0">country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They deported you before your bond hearing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you even saw the immigration officer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the judge didn&#39;t say, &quot;You are getting deported.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If I&#39;m not mistaken, I wasn&#39;t even signed by the deportation judge. I was thrown out by my ICE officer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they say anything when they threw you out?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I told him, &quot;Hey, I want a phone call.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;ll get a phone in TJ.&quot; I told him, &quot;I&#39;m not going to sign anything.&quot; &quot;You got to sign stuff.&quot; I&#39;ve heard them hurting people if they don&#39;t want to sign. They&#39;ll put your hand in the back and twist it </span><span>until</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you might even break and stuff, but I was like, why even go through all this hassle? They&#39;re deporting me illegally, so might as well just see what comes from it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you arrived in TJ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got to the Mexican Consul, they gave me paperwork so I could have, what is it? Medical records, be able to go to the doctor&#39;s for the next two years. So they gave me type of insurance for myself, medical forms and stuff. That was pretty cool. They gave me pretty much an ID and stuff, but still, in Mexico, they don&#39;t respect that. They told me that some guy tried to give him a Mexican ID that they gave him at the Mexican Consul, and they still took everything he had, even his shoes. This happened by a policeman.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican police?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the Mexican police, they said, &quot;No, this is invalid. I need actual paperwork.&quot; And he&#39;s like, &quot;I don&#39;t have anything, what do you want?&quot; He took his phone, he took his money and his shoes. So that&#39;s why I was like, damn. But it was pretty cool, because they told me, &quot;Hey, if you don&#39;t have nowhere to stay, there&#39;s actually...&quot; I forgot what it was called, but it was a little home shelter, a little shelter for deported people. And they&#39;ll give you jobs and stuff, to live for at least, I believe, two weeks or two months or something like that. But my mom&#39;s neighbor actually came, picked me up and took me to the hotel that we actually booked for a week.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. Was your transition back to Mexico society hard?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was. It was different. Like I mentioned, that&#39;s the only thing that I have, the English, but other than that, I&#39;m pretty sure it would have been really difficult. It would have been hard to actually go through life without the English that I carry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to be away from your sister and your family?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you the main provider for your sister and your mom when you left?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, no. My mom was working and stuff, but once I started working on my own, I started... I had a girlfriend, I moved out and stuff. It wasn&#39;t until the last two months that my mom actually took me back into her home. That&#39;s why at the end, we weren&#39;t even that close, but my mom always checked up on me and made sure I had food, I had somewhere to stay and all that, but that&#39;s why I wasn&#39;t really that much of a big factor in their life after the last year that I was there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came back, were you still with that girlfriend from up there? No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I wasn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[inaudible 00:26:29]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. I was going court cases, and then she had her own stuff. School, work. That&#39;s why I was just like, we both decided not to stay together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came back here, you were able to get a job pretty easily.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where at?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I got a job as a waiter right there where I lived, at the little plaza. But once my friend told me, because he was deported too, we stayed in the same place, he was in </span><span>&nbsp;Guanajuato.</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;He told me, &quot;Hey, this place called TTEC</span><span>H</span><span class="c3">&nbsp;right there by where you stay, they&#39;re actually taking people. You want to work for them? We get referral money and stuff.&quot; I was like, &quot;Sure.&quot; It&#39;s a decent job. I don&#39;t see myself answering phones all my life, but that&#39;s why I&#39;m trying to find option B and st</span><span>uff</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to go back to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I want to study. Yeah, I really want to study to either be a teacher or be an architect. In architecture, engineering. I got English, so if I get certified in anything, I think that&#39;s a big plus.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is your high school diploma going to be helpful?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They asked me for it here, but their expectations in studies, because our English studies and Spanish studies is two different things. I don&#39;t think they&#39;re going to meet at the end of the day. I think I still have to go to some type of high school here or something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you experience any discrimination as a migrant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Not really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been approached or recruited by groups of bad people in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I tend to stay away from people here. I only stay with my girlfriend and my baby, that&#39;s it. And my family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss about the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, honestly, the beach. I miss the beach, you know, being able to wake up every morning and just do whatever I want, make myself a milkshake, open my fridge and be able to grab whatever I want to eat. It&#39;s really hard to live out here. I mean you&#39;re living day by day here. Over there, you&#39;re buying groceries for two whole weeks and they&#39;re going to sit there and they&#39;re going to last you two weeks. Here, you got to go day by day. You buy a week&#39;s worth of groceries, you&#39;re wasting 1,000, 2,000 pesos and that&#39;s like half your paycheck right here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s what I miss more. Being able to eat whatever I want, being able to travel whenever I wanted to. Not travel out of the state, you know, but travel to San Francisco or to the beach or to the mountains. Los Angeles has everything. That was the best part about Los Angeles. That&#39;s why I love it, but other than that, it&#39;s all the same here. You wake up to work, you go home to sleep and eat and that&#39;s it. You do it all over, it&#39;s the same thing with the States but it feels like you got more freedom, more availability to do whatever you want, whenever you want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you feel more like a US citizen or like a Mexican citizen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I mean, honestly, not really, well I mean... yeah, I grew up there, but I have to recognize where I came from. I wasn&#39;t born there and I did know that since I was little, so that&#39;s why I never felt myself actually like a US citizen. That&#39;s why I don&#39;t really consider myself a US citizen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel more comfortable here than you did over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. I mean it&rsquo;s a new lifestyle. I got to go in the metro to do this and that, when I could have just got an Uber or taxi. I could still do it here, but over there, I had the money, I had flexibility to do things that I can&#39;t do here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Would you recommend that people migrate to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, no, I wouldn&#39;t. It&#39;s a decent place to live and it&#39;s a good place to live, and I&#39;m not going to lie, but you still have to worry about where you&#39;re going to stay at, what are you going to live off of, how you&#39;re going to get what your necessities in life. You still have worry about you don&#39;t speak English, how are you going to be able to do things? If you have f</span><span>luent</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;English or half-decent English, then go ahead. Try to make it something of yourself, but it&#39;s still difficult to make it without any ways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like any American values stuck with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. I mean. I don&#39;t know. I mean, </span><span>i</span><span class="c0">n what way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If anything about being in the US and growing up in the US, learning to pledge allegiance in school and the way cops are supposed to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The way the rights, laws and stuff, that stuck with me but I seen here that you give them 200 pesos and they&#39;re going to let you go for whatever you did or whatever they&#39;re claiming you did. Yeah. Those ways, yeah, the rights and stuff, they did stick with me. You still have rights here in Mexico, but I really haven&#39;t looked into them to see what&#39;s the difference between the two, but you still feel more... You have more freedom here, but you don&#39;t feel safe. You have [less] freedom there, but you do feel safe. That&#39;s why it&#39;s kind of hard to tell them apart.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways do you think being in the US has shaped who you are today? And what you believe now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s the way I grew up, knowing I have necessities and that I have to work to where I want to be, because I didn&#39;t grow up with the richest family and stuff, so that&#39;s why I know I have to get up every morning, get myself ready for work, because no one&#39;s going to work for me now so I have to do it on my own. So I mean those ways have stuck with me. That&#39;s something that actually stuck with me and learned that I&#39;m not going to get things easy, I have to do it by my means and stuff. But other than that, I don&#39;t think really much has stuck with me. Yeah, the US, not the US culture, because I don&#39;t carry a US shirt on me all the time, but there are habits and stuff I grew up on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think a lot of Mexican deportees from the US would turn to crime when they come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you mean? When they&#39;re deported? Well, some people, I&#39;m not going to speak for everyone but people do come back with their old habits. Old habits are hard to grow from, and I learned that being inside jail or being inside detention centers. That&#39;s why I was just... The old habits are hard to break. You have to put it like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you have a daughter now, right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With your girlfriend or partner? How has that changed your thoughts about migrating?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I still have this vision of going back, because I would love my daughter to go to school in the US. Try to help her to an extent where she gets good grades and she might even get some type of scholarship to be able to go to the US or something. Try to look into that, but other than that, going to live out there, it&#39;d be better because I could go ahead and send more money towards my family and help them raise it, but I&#39;m not going to be physically there. That&#39;s where the troubles come in, because I want to be there for my daughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got deported, I wasn&#39;t really worried. Okay, she&#39;s going to be born and she&#39;s not going to have a father. Once I actually seen her in my arms, that&#39;s when I was like, I&#39;m not going to let this little thing grow up by herself. That&#39;s not fair for her nor for me, because I still have the thoughts now, where she&#39;s going to grow up from? What is she going to grow up to be? Who&#39;s going to guide her? What if some other guy comes into her life? Other than that, if I was over there, okay, she&#39;s going to be financial stable but I still don&#39;t know what she&#39;s getting into. That&#39;s why I&#39;d rather be here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a sacrifice that I actually made when they told me I could go back. In November, they called me, they told me, &quot;Hey, you can come back to the States.&quot; But I actually didn&#39;t want to return because of the same reason. I just want to be here to provide for my daughter and guide her the way she has to be, because that&#39;s the way my parents taught me. Yeah, I made mistakes in the past, but I&#39;m not going to let those effect me in the future and I&#39;m just going to show that to my daughter. I had everything made for me. I had a nice home, I had my own car. I&#39;m right here struggling in Mexico, just to show you what&#39;s right and wrong. That&#39;s what helped me build my mindset a little bit to bigger and stronger.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Walk me through some of that moment. It must have been really hard for you to be like, have this opportunity to go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To see your family.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was a lot of tears shed by my mom. Mostly my mom, because she put all the money and she paid a lawyer all the way through my whole case. She still fought my DUI cases on the side. All her struggle and her sacrifice was... It only showed that I didn&#39;t really care about her, but when I actually do care about her, but I had something to look forward to of my own now. That&#39;s why she came to an understanding, &quot;Okay, he had a baby, I have to understand his decisions.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I thought about it like this. I go back, I still have to fight for bond. That&#39;s still a 10,000, $15,000 bond that I was going to get and that&#39;s even if I get released on bond. I still had that issue. 50/50 chance I do get released and I don&#39;t. And then I started to think about my baby, and then how was I going to get a job? Because I still had to wait a year to get a work permit. My baby wasn&#39;t going to eat just air. The diapers, I needed to worry about diapers and stuff. How was I going to help her and stuff? I was trying to look into different ways, and the only thing that came up was this thing, because that&#39;s the only way she&#39;s going to have what I want her to have.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Must have been hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was difficult. Everyone was telling me, &quot;Go back, go back.&quot; But that feeling that you&#39;re about to be a father and just run off. I even said, &quot;I&#39;ll buy her a tablet, I&#39;ll send her a tablet, just for Skype or something.&quot; But then I was like, it&#39;s not like you... What if I actually have her to hug her and stuff? I think that&#39;s the best feeling. Me and my dad weren&#39;t that close and I can only picture what it is to grow without a dad. Rebellious, not knowing what it was like to have a father. That must be hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t want her to grow with that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. I think the time will come that maybe I&#39;ll get some paperwork put into court, but it&#39;s not something I&#39;m planning to do now or anytime soon. I first want to be able to show that I have stability, that I recovered from my mistakes and stuff, that I can go back and not be a problem for the US. That&#39;s the first thing. Create my image from when I got deported to when I put that paperwork in. A year won&#39;t demonstrate too much for the US government. You know? That&#39;s why it&#39;s not something that I want to do so quick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What lawyer helped you with your case?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some guy _____. I don&#39;t know his first name, but _____. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do you know when they called you, when it was that you were going to be able to come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was actually supposed to meet him at some immigration, some ICE stop at the border. I was supposed to meet a certain office.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a consulate officer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. Consulate officer, and then he was going to have me detained there for a little bit until my officer from Adelanto came by and that&#39;s pretty much they told me, that&#39;s all they told me. Then I was still going to be held, detained, until I had a bond hearing. Bond hearings aren&#39;t until a month, month and a half after. And then if you don&#39;t get your first bond hearing, you don&#39;t have a bond hearing &rsquo;til like six months after. I think it was called the Rodriguez or something like that. That&#39;s why I was just like, man, if I don&#39;t get bond the first hearing, that&#39;s a whole month worth of lawyer money that my parents are going to throw into this, and then still throw in another couple grand just to be able to have me detained in Adelanto. So it&#39;s a win win for them and it&#39;s a lose lose lose win for me. So I didn&#39;t really find the evens played out for my favor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did your partner tell you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To go back. Yeah. I </span><span>grew up in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the States. When I think about going back to the States, it gives me chills. It brings a smile to my face, because I remember all of family moments, all the memories that I have from the States. I mentioned, growing up in Los Angeles, you got the beach, you got the desert, you got the mountains, you got whatever you want so close to you. You just decide one day, yeah, I want to go here. You worked all week, why not? Enjoy yourself. That&#39;s what I miss a lot about the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that covers all the questions that I have. What do you think the Mexican government can do better to help someone like you reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c3">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I mean, it&#39;s hard to say, &quot;Yeah, give every immigrant money.&quot; No, just give them shelter, give them food, give them water, give them a capability of making a phone call or two or three if they need to. There&#39;s not much you can do for someone when so many people are getting deported everyday. You&#39;re getting a group of 20, 25 in just one day or in one hour. So</span><span>, I mean&hellip; </span><span class="c0">You can&#39;t say, &quot;Just give them money.&quot; Because you never know if these people are going to go waste their money or not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They have alcohol issues or whatever, how can we have them go to rehab or something? Have something open for them, because where I went, I almost got in a fight with some guy because he thought I took his blanket and his pillow but all he wanted was just my blanket and my pillow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Adelanto?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in the shelter where they had me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here, yeah, in TJ. I made it a big deal because I wasn&#39;t about to give him my stuff. I was cold and I wanted to just sleep and stuff. I wasn&#39;t just going to sleep without no pillow and no blanket. So some guy had to get into and be like, &quot;You know what? You take your stuff and you take his stuff. You take your stuff, just split it up already.&quot; And all night, I was just with that worry that he was just going to get up and strike me or something. He smelled like straight alcohol. That&#39;s what I&#39;m saying. You give someone money, you never know what that person&#39;s going to lead to. He&#39;s going to bring himself more down. Just give him the comfort that they need at that moment, because it&#39;s hard, not even knowing...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean TJ is so far from where I&#39;m at right now. They told me, &quot;I&#39;ll pay your bus ride.&quot; When I was at the shelter, but it&#39;s going to take two and a half weeks. I was like, &quot;What? I&#39;m not going to wait two and a half weeks just to be able to... I&#39;ll find another way there.&quot; And luckily, my mom blessed me with some tickets. That&#39;s how I got down here, but it was going to be two and a half weeks in a bus stop. What if we get stopped by cartel or something and they just want to just mess with someone? That&#39;s why there was too many factors, too many issues that came across my mind when I said two and a half weeks going down South in Mexico where I don&#39;t even recognize anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s why it&#39;s cool that they&#39;ll pay for your stuff, they&#39;ll give you food, but they just need to make it more... I don&#39;t know. Make it more like stronger, in a way. Like I mentioned, rehab, having nice shelter like they do. I&#39;m not going to lie, I knew some guy that was there for two months and he had a nice little job, he was already saving some money to get back to where he needs to go. That was good from their part. But it&#39;s still not something comfortable. No one&#39;s going to bring a smile to your face, you just got deported. It&#39;s really hard to fill in those needs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. And I think that covers all the questions I had for you today, all the questions I had in mind. Thank you again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c5">Part 2</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then one time they actually were going to take us to some aerospace engineering station. And they don&rsquo;t let me in because I didn&#39;t have a California ID. So that&#39;s when everything just like hit me harder because that&#39;s when everyone knew that I was an immigrant. So that&#39;s when, like, you know these people for four years and then they&#39;re like, &quot;What? This guy doesn&#39;t have papers?&quot; And then it just starts a rumor in school. So that&#39;s when I was like, &quot;Fuck.&quot; I really didn&#39;t want to go to that school anymore. That&#39;s what brought me down too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you see all your friends graduating around [inaudible 00:00:33]?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So right now, I&rsquo;m like going through Instagram&hellip; That&rsquo;s why I&#39;m actually not going through Instagram right now, because it brings me down, dude. My sister&#39;s going to graduate in two years from Cal State Fullerton and stuff, but, I mean that brings me joy, but I&#39;m not going to be able to be there. That&#39;s what shoots me down more because she told me, &quot;All right, you&#39;re not going to be here for my high school diploma, but you&#39;ll be here for my college degree, right?&quot; I was like, &quot;Hopefully.&quot; I mean it&#39;s not going to happen, but&hellip; I mean we&#39;re lucky we have iPhones nowadays. You know, just being able to fucking snap something and stuff. I mean it is hard, dude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s wild. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you thought about continuing online education here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I haven&rsquo;t. I mean they&rsquo;ll actually help you pay for the school here at the job, so that&#39;s what I&#39;m trying to look into. But since I only have six months here, I want to feel more comfortable because they hire people like crazy here. I mean, you got a group of 20 people getting hired every single day. So that&#39;s why I&#39;m not getting too comfortable there until I have like a year, year and a half there, and then maybe I could.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re just looking for the next step to come up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Vic:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Sergio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good. All right, Victor.</span></p><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c7"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
