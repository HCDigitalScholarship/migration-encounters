This is Lizzy and I&#39;m here with Louis for the interview and I&#39;m actually going to put this mic here.] Would you be comfortable with it right here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So I would love to know just to start off, some of the basics of like, how old were you when you came to the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well I was about ten years old when I migrated to the states.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born in Mexico City. I was in first, second, third, and fourth grade. I took elementary and junior high, high school, some college. My mom, originally she&#39;s from Mexico City. My dad&#39;s from El Salvador.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad, he was in the civil war back in the 80s or something like that. I really don&#39;t know full details of the story. He doesn&#39;t go into that. I just know he got asylum after in the states.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. For the civil war that was going. There was that civil war that was happening at the time. I don&#39;t know much of the details or none of that. He met my mother here in Mexico City. He went to the states and after some years... I was about 11 when I migrated to California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I arrived to L.A. I was in Los Angeles for some time. I started fifth grade and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like, starting school in a new country? Did you know any English at the time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t know any English. I had no idea. I didn&#39;t even know the states existed. It was hard in the beginning because I didn&#39;t know the language and most of the kids in elementary school spoke Spanish, so instead of learning English it was just like being home. My dad didn&#39;t like what was going on. I guess his vision was just something different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&#39;t like what was going on with living in an area with a lot of other Latino people?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Living in an... He didn&#39;t like Los Angeles, all the Latino... Not exactly Latino people, I guess he was just trying to get away from violence, and L.A.&#39;s L.A. All the gangsters, all the violence, all the drugs, all that. All the things that any good parent just tries to avoid. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worries about.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Worries about his kids. So we moved to San Francisco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever experience any violence in L.A.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was a kid... Personally no, but-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, when I was in Los Angeles, no, but I mean, I saw many things. I just discovered a whole different world.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell more about that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you want to know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What is this whole other world that you discovered.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was in fifth grade, usually in elementary school is first to sixth grade right? The elementary school I was going to was first grade all the way up to high school, in the same school. It was just weird. I hadn&#39;t seen that. Even in the other schools in the other counties or whatever, I had never seen that before.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is different.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That is different. And it was a change. Mentally it was mind awakening. Being in fifth grade and hanging around with high school kids. You learn many things at an age you shouldn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were exposed to things at a younger age.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was exposed to many things. I mean I didn&#39;t even have sexual education at the time. Can you speak about those kinds of things?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, absolutely.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want interesting stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We have no filter. Interesting stuff is what we want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Interesting stuff. I mean I was in fifth grade and I had the chance... I mean my sexual education or the things that I saw was with high school people. Teenagers are very... You know how it is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yup.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And those kinds of things, being in fifth grade, that was the kind of environment I was exposed to. So you just become awake and aware of many things that I think you shouldn&#39;t. My dad realized many of those kind of things that was going on and he said, &quot;I don&#39;t want this.&quot; So we moved to San Francisco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never expected to come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come back to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Come back to Mexico. And my family was my mom, my dad, my two brothers. I didn&#39;t have any communication with the family left there. I was just going through the whole motions of just my regular life. I did some college.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the states?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the states and I didn&#39;t finish it. I didn&#39;t expect none of the many things that you go through while coming back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how old were you when you came back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I only came back about three years ago, three, four years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in the states for 20-something years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Most of your life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was born here but my heart and soul were in California. I miss California.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever... I love California too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s the best state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you always live in California?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Always, but I mean I got to... I&#39;ve been to Texas. I was in California, Texas, New Mexico, Arizona, Nevada, and all them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But California is where your heart is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;California&#39;s the golden state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss the most about California?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the food. The food and the people. I&#39;ve been here for a couple years, three or four years, and I&#39;m starting to lose practice speaking English. My first language is Spanish. But you speak English so much it just becomes natural. and I come back and it was just weird. My first language is Spanish, but I come back and I&#39;m more used to speaking English now than I am Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you struggle with speaking Spanish when you came back here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I came back... Because in the writing you know, it was just different. It&#39;s a change. I mean, you&#39;re not from here, you&#39;re not from over there, and you want to be over there, and you have to be here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve heard that kind of thing from a lot of people, that they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re from here, but they don&#39;t feel like they&#39;re from there either. For your identity, where do you feel like you&#39;re the most from, or which place do you identify with the most?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Home is where the heart&#39;s at. I guess it depends on the mentality. I mean, you come back and there&#39;s many good things over here and many bad things, just like any other place. I guess I was just so used to the culture. It&#39;s a rarity over there. On Monday-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The culture in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;US. I mean, just the people, you always use to see different kinds of people all the time...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like different races.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different races and different foods. I guess it&#39;s just a lifestyle. It&#39;s a mixed culture that becomes a unique culture. You grow a love for that, and being over here is just weird. It&#39;s a weird being with your own people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What things have you noticed about the culture since being back here that surprised you? Or that you weren&#39;t use to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I wasn&#39;t use to. People are just a lot different. Everything&#39;s about money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here. I mean I wouldn&#39;t say poverty, but financially it&#39;s a big change especially when you&#39;re use to your regular life. For instance, trying to buy a car here. Unless you have... You have to struggle more to get certain things. It becomes stressful.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is it just the money? Struggling to get the money? Or that it&#39;s difficult to go through the process? Paperwork or... What is it that makes it difficult?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything. I don&#39;t have an I.D. over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have any I.D. in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I barely processed it. As a matter of fact, I get it tomorrow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. That&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I don&#39;t have a stable place and they ask for too many paperwork and things like that, which is kind of hard. A friend of mine had a little... Lend me a hand on many things. And to find a job, there&#39;s too many... I don&#39;t want to say hard but... It&#39;s not like the states. I mean, you browse an ad and there&#39;s many job opportunities and things like that and over here, you pick up the newspaper, and it&#39;s hard .</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s harder to find a job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we could back track a little bit, would you be able to tell me about led you to leaving the states and coming back here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the time, it started with the recession.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I use to paint cars for a living over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You use to paint cars?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I worked in a body shop since I was a teen. And after the recession started kicking in, I lost everything. I lost my job, financial problems, the whole motions. I had a family member that was also in the states. I guess I gather some money. It&#39;s real stressful being in the states, and I had no paperwork. Just the fact that you can&#39;t drive and you have so many barriers to do many of the simple things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a lot of extra stress you&#39;re carrying on your shoulders every day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s stressful you know. I&#39;m not going to complain about... I heard many people complain about the government and many things you know. I&#39;m not with that kind of mentality. It&#39;s common sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you don&#39;t feel anger towards the government of the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. I mean it&#39;s what it is. Somethings are just given and people are just stupid to judge and criticize, and those kinds of things. It&#39;s just politics. Just politics but... Being Mexican is one thing, being Chicano is different. It&#39;s a whole different thing. Being American is a whole different thing. Mexicans sometimes don&#39;t even co-exist really good with their Chicano. You know what a Chicano is right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different mentalities, different ways of life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that is? The, it&#39;s difficult to co-exist?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me give you an example. I was born here and I don&#39;t deny my roots. My younger brother was born in the states, but he doesn&#39;t speak Spanish. He doesn&#39;t want to speak Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Me and him really don&#39;t communicate. Different mentalities. He&#39;s used to hanging around with different... I mean he hangs around with different races, either Hindu or Chinese or American, African American and all that. It&#39;s a whole different mentality. He doesn&#39;t hang around with Mexicans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t. He&#39;s still brown. I don&#39;t share that kind of mentality. We&#39;re brothers. We were raised by the same mom, the same dad and all that, and the contrast is just really different and I guess it&#39;s just the way you&#39;re just raised sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that&#39;s why you and he don&#39;t talk very much?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s the reason why. That&#39;s the reason why. He doesn&#39;t visit. You know what I mean? I don&#39;t want this to sound as a complaint or poor me or... No. But my brother... Mexico&#39;s a terrible country. My brother, he sees Mexico as... I don&#39;t know what&#39;s the word I&#39;m looking for. It&#39;s just like something lower than his standards. I don&#39;t know if I&#39;m explaining myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right. It makes sense. It sounds like he&#39;s kind of rejected that part of his life </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He rejects-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it is part of who he is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean that&#39;s who you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some people have a hard time accepting it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s who you are. I guess everything... Well, from my point of view, everything has to do with money. Over here, some people are sometimes humble. The more money you make less humble you are sometimes. I&#39;m not saying that&#39;s the case for everybody. But... Do you understand what I&#39;m trying to tell you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was in that kind of mindset sometimes. I just make... I was stable when I was in the states. I made about 26, 27, up to $30 an hour in the trade that I was in. At the time that I was in, it was pretty good money. You could buy yourself a house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. And what about here in Mexico? Are you comfortable financially or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a contrast. It&#39;s a big contrast. As a matter of fact, I&#39;m going to be here in the city for about a month and a half now. I was living in a different state.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidalgo.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hidalgo and... A friend of mine gave me a place to stay for about two weeks. That was two weeks ago. He told me, &quot;I&#39;m going to lend you a hand. You can be here for about two weeks. So once you get your own spot,&quot; and things like that. And two weeks went by, I haven&#39;t been able to...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, are you looking for a job here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just looking for a job, for a place to stay, and everything. And it just becomes hard. I won&#39;t say impossible, but sometimes you just need some time. And my family&#39;s over there, my mom, my dad are still in the states, my brother.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any family here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Over in a different state. but since I was in the states for so many years, the communication wasn&#39;t really that good so I mean, it&#39;s family but it&#39;s really not a family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as close.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s family only on Christmas and New Year&#39;s. That kind of thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Not anyone that you&#39;re going to call up on the phone every day and...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, basically I&#39;m on my own. I never got married in the states. I had a girl. I have my kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How many kids do you have?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Three. I got... The oldest one&#39;s 15. And I got two twins.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boys or girls?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Boy and a girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And do they all live in California?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re in California right now. Well, the person that was supposed to... My ex-girlfriend, she came. After I got here, I got settled in per say. She came, she said, &quot;Let&#39;s work things out and things.&quot; She came, she looked around, and she saw it, and she said, &quot;Fuck that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is she from the states?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was born in Jalisco.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was about six months when her parents took her to the states. She doesn&#39;t...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&#39;t want to come back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s not a citizen. She&#39;s not a resident. She&#39;s none of that. But she&#39;s lived there for all her life. When I came here she wanted to give herself a chance. She came. It didn&#39;t work, she didn&#39;t like it. No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That must have been hard because that&#39;s something that you can&#39;t control.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That broke my heart. I was with her for about 17 years. My high school sweetheart. There are just some things when you migrate, it affects many parts of your life. Unless you&#39;re living it you might comprehend or empathize. I was with her for about 17 years. It&#39;s a whole lifetime. Many people suggested at the time, or gave me advice, so many years, she&#39;ll hang around and so, so. But once you move and you start, you have to seek your own benefit also. That&#39;s one of the things that might affect coming back home. Those little obstacles sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s heartbreaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s heartbreaking.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was that... How long after you came back to Mexico, did that happen, that she came and tried it out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About three years ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So it was soon after.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Soon after. I&#39;ve only been here about three or four years. I don&#39;t really keep track. The time just flies.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Trump?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Trump.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Trump. That&#39;s how we keep track.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before Trump. Around Obama time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What&#39;s been the hardest part about creating a new life back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the hardest part, I wouldn&#39;t say it isn&#39;t just one idea or concept. It&#39;s many things. It just affects you emotionally, psychologically, many aspects of life. I&#39;ve been around and sometimes you&#39;re just homesick. And not having any family around, sometimes it&#39;s just hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get lonely?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. Sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been able to create some kind of social network, friends, community in Hidalgo?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do sometimes, but sometimes you just don&#39;t fit in.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can socialize and many things but sometimes it&#39;s just not your kind of people. I mean, it&#39;s not bad people, it&#39;s just different topics to talk about, different experiences, and when you start talking to local people about your daily life and things that you do or have lived, sometimes... For example, sometimes, let&#39;s just say, I&#39;ve been in the states and you say, I went to Vegas. And Vegas, which is Vegas. You come over here and say, Vegas, it&#39;s like, ah, he&#39;s trying to show off or that kind of thing. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Being over there, some of the things are different. And once you try to... I don&#39;t know how to explain myself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you&#39;re doing a good job explaining yourself.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Those kinds of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes it a little bit harder to connect with people here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Harder to connect with people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Have there been any positive things about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I learned humbleness in a really hard way. Everything for me was just money, money, money. Being in the states... I don&#39;t know, I wouldn&#39;t say an obsession, but everything just, money here, money there, and I had to give myself the chance to see life in a whole different way. In my home I was raised not believing in God. But then there were, he don&#39;t believe in God. I grew up with that kind of mentality. I started believing in God when I came here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really. So that&#39;s a big change in your life and your mindset coming back here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a big change. Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did that happen? Did you start going to church here or was it just your own spiritual views that changed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a spiritual experience. As a matter of fact, where I&#39;m at right now, it&#39;s a clinic for rehab. A friend of mine... I&#39;m staying over at a rehab place. I lend them a hand and I do some chores here and there and he gave me a place to stay for two weeks until I get up on my foot. I&#39;ve been hearing some of these stories and going there and talking to people in addictions and many of those things. It will change your mind. What goes on in here. How much do you know from the city?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much do I know about Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Not from the textbook. Personally.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been in Mexico City since Friday, so most of what I know about Mexico City so far is talking to you guys. So, you have a lot to teach me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Many of the things that go on in Mexico City, once you get into the nooks and crannies and things, it&#39;s a whole different world. I mean, we hear in the news about the drug wars and all that good stuff. You&#39;re not seeing many of those things in the states. While I was at the clinic speaking to some of the people that go through there and share their experiences and talk to some of the people that are homeless and things like that, it&#39;ll change your mind, like this. And that helps you learn to be a little bit humbler.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it taught you to be more humble and it also helped you to-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal growth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did that help with forming your belief in God too?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You know, I don&#39;t share... Many of the people that you speak to, they complain about being deported and I think just really hard, and poor me, and things. It&#39;s fucking hard, because it is. But there&#39;s many options also. But I also see the contrasts. When you&#39;re in the states, sometimes you&#39;re just blindfolded to many, many things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s an interesting point. Do you feel like the blindfolds been taken off now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some of it. Some of it. Let me give an example. What do you think about a drug kingpin?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do I think about a drug kingpin?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I haven&#39;t had a lot of personal experiences with them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, me neither. Let me give you an idea. You watch the news... Well, from my point of view, you watch the news and things like that, people are selling drugs, the bad people and all that. But if you ask any of the children-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;ll say they&#39;re good people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re the good people. Maybe this is a stupid comparison but when you&#39;re in the states, you&#39;re the children of whoever&#39;s at the top.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re the children of Donald Trump?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re the children of Donald Trump.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re blindfolded about many of the things that go around. I&#39;m saying this... Once you move to a third world country and you start seeing some of the real things that go around, it&#39;s just like, I haven&#39;t seen anything. It makes... Well, personally with me, my mentality, the way I use to think about many things changed drastically.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s been the biggest change in how you think about things?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to judge.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like even a drug kingpin, not to judge them. That kind of thing?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not to judge. In the sense that whatever corner you go to, you&#39;ll find a spot. Be it prostitution or drug sales, it&#39;s pretty obvious. Same thing is in the states. I use to be the kind of person that&#39;d be like, how come? Maybe if I&#39;m working and doing things the way that I should, then how come there&#39;s people that are making more money and the government&#39;s not doing anything. That kind of sense.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s how you thought when you were in the states?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Once I&rsquo;ve been, for instance, the two, three weeks I&#39;ve been at the clinic, I&#39;ve spoken to some of the people within rehab and some of the people that&#39;ve just been there, and you see different points of view. Some of the points of view change sometimes. Some people really do it out of need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sounds like you have developed more empathy and compassion for people of different circumstances.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Not an excuse because people... Everyone&#39;s responsible for their own choices.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that you understand a little bit more about-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just able to see the contrasts. Both sides.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s a really valuable outlook to have, a really valuable mindset that a lot of people could learn from.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, on that note, another thing I wanted to ask you is, you&#39;ve had experiences living in the US and in Mexico and you&#39;ve lived through the contrast of both countries and what it&#39;s like coming back here. Do you think that there&#39;s more that the government should be doing to help people in your situation or-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, they could be doing anything they want, they just don&#39;t. They just don&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, what do you think they should do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know. I think... Maybe just want something right now, you know the president that&#39;s in office right now, he&#39;s not perfect. But everything&#39;s politics, but maybe he&#39;s... He seems he wants to make a change. Maybe not enough time but maybe it&#39;s a start. Any government in any country, they could do whatever they want so reality, you know. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could do it, but doesn&rsquo;t mean they should.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They could... Or they would.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about in the US? Do you have any... What are your opinions about what-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The US is the US you know. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s where you&#39;ve spent most of your life and do you... I don&#39;t know how much you have followed Donald Trump and things like that, the current situation.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not so much anymore. I watch the news and I was informed. I kept myself educated while I was in the states. Once I&#39;m not there I just...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably better not to pay attention to it. But part of what we are trying to do here with this project is to help change people&#39;s perceptions of migrants in the US because, as we have seen with Donald Trump and people that have elected him, there are a lot of people in the US that maybe just don&#39;t understand. Maybe they&#39;ve never really talked to someone who&#39;s a migrant, and they don&#39;t really know what it&#39;s like. And so...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s hard to make people... Someone with that kind of mentality, from my point of view, it&#39;s really hard to make them understand. Unless you actually live or see or taken the time to comprehend some of the things that go around with the immigrants, it&#39;s not going to change.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what do you think we could do to help change people&#39;s minds or help people be more compassionate for migrants?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Maybe what we&#39;re doing right now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s our hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What you&#39;re doing right now. Taking the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what we hope.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Taking the time. Give people the opportunity to show what they got.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and that&#39;s why it&#39;s so valuable to us to hear from you in your own voice so that all of these stories that we&#39;re collecting, all of your voices all together, and hopefully we can give that a platform that people in the US, even if just one person changes their mind a little bit, that would be good, but hopefully, more. But to help people see the human side, to listen to your story and maybe that can help a little bit, hopefully.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That helps. It just depends... I guess... You and me are two different cultures. I don&#39;t know how your life is, or was, or what kind of mindset you&#39;ve got, but you know in reality we&#39;re two different people. I don&#39;t know if you understand that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, I do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived in the states but I really comprehend what it feels to be you. You can share your life stories and things like that, but it&#39;s two different cultures. The people that have been there, Chicanos have been there for a lot of time, they try to assimilate. It&#39;s more like a hybrid kind of thing. Therefore, comes a phrase, neither from here nor from there. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you speak Spanish?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Only a little bit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The neither here, nor there. I&#39;ve heard a lot of people talk about that concept.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Some use it as an excuse also.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excuse for what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An excuse just to try get a point across. Sometimes. Facts can be manipulated to support your own conclusions sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s true. Well, I have one last question for you as we start wrapping up. And it&#39;s been so good talking to you. You have a lot of interesting insights about things. But I&#39;m just curious about what your plans are, your hopes and dreams for your life moving forward here, in Mexico, or if you hope to return to the US. What&#39;s your dream?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t plan to go back to the states. I would love to... I&#39;m homesick. I miss California man. I&#39;m homesick. But to travel over there legally, you need some change. You need some money you know, and if I&#39;m realistic, and I really don&#39;t know if I&#39;m going to get across. If I have that kind of money, I&#39;d just start myself some business and I go forward. There&#39;s money here. There&#39;s money here. Sometimes you just need a little push, a head start. Things are sometimes not exactly what they seem. There is a good side. There is many points of view. But getting that push sometimes when you&#39;re just backwards, for instance, let&#39;s just say as an example, getting that push being by yourself or being to a terrible place with nothing but... It&#39;s just hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sometimes, in my case, I&#39;d been there in the states for so long that my family over here, they&#39;re family but only family during Christmas, not all year round. So it&#39;s kind of hard sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like you still need the push or do you feel like you&#39;ve gotten the push that you need.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I need a big push.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what kind of push you&#39;re hoping for?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. A job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A job. I&#39;m not the kind of person that likes to stretch my hand and be like, here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes even... It&#39;s just hard to... I don&#39;t know how to explain myself man. I don&#39;t want to stretch my hand and be like, give me, give me, give me. I want to do my own thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I understand.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But sometimes you&#39;re just in a place where I really don&#39;t know the city either and I was born here. I&#39;m trying to find a rent and being without a job but at the moment and being many things is fucking hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a hard situation you&#39;re in. It seems like the mindset that you have of being humbled like you said, understanding people more, it&#39;s something that I think will help you out a lot moving forward here but I know that doesn&#39;t pay the bills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn&#39;t pay the bills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That doesn&#39;t pay the bills.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, being humble and being good hearted and all that. It helps you anyway, whether you&#39;re here or in China you know. But that doesn&#39;t pay the bills. I can&#39;t go to the bank and be like, &quot;I&#39;m humble.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Do you have any jobs that you&#39;ve been looking at around here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. As a matter of fact I looked... I started looking into some body shops and things like that. But they&#39;re not really body shops. They&#39;re just more... They&#39;re a whole lot different. And I don&rsquo;t have access to my I.D. and someone at the clinic lending a hand with her address, with a phone bill, things like that, that can pass as my I.D. That was about two weeks ago. As a matter of fact I get it tomorrow. And without that I wasn&#39;t really able to get a fucking job.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, hopefully having that is going to... Hopefully that will be a little push.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s the first start. I looked into some call centers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call centers. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you looked into TeleTech? The big one here?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I really don&#39;t know where to look. That&#39;s the problem sometimes. I really don&#39;t know where to look sometimes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you talked much with the people at New Comienzos</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they&#39;re our partners in this, and they&#39;re all about helping this kind of situation and so they would be good people to talk to for advice with a job search too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you should see what they have to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I will.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As we start wrapping up here, because I do want to get your photo and you get you out of here so we&#39;re not taking too much of your time. But we&#39;re so glad to have you here. But is there anything else, anything that I haven&#39;t asked about that you want to talk about or anything else that you want to say before we wrap it up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really. Do you have anything else to ask, I&#39;ll answer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think you&#39;ve been a very interesting person to talk to. I appreciate how... You&#39;re very honest about your views on things and I feel like I&#39;ve learned a lot from you, and I think it&#39;s valuable to all of us to have you as part of this project.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c3">Luis:</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really appreciate it. </span></p><p class="c0 c16"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c13"><span class="c9"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c5"><tbody><tr class="c12"><td class="c14" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span class="c9"></span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c15"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c10"><span class="c9"></span></p></div></body></html>
