  "text":"Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I\n   remember you\u2014in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like\n   that\u2014will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].\n   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give\n   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You\n   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,\n   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I\n   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I\n   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all\n   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would\n   live there, I was happy.\n \n \n  "
