  "text":"ect. So\n   that your voice gets heard. How did you come back to Mexico? When did you\n   go back the first time?\n \n \n   Joana: The first time it was when I was fourteen, 2014, because I was born\n   in 2000 so it kind of goes by the year. Like I said, I came back as a\n   family reunion, but it kind of extended a little.\n \n \n   Anita: You came back to visit your family, you mean?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, ma'am",
