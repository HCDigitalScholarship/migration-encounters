  "text":"Jose: Yeah. My sister also acted out. I feel like more than anything, my\n   younger brother was the one that was traumatized the most. I was like 13\n   and he was like eight, nine years old when my parents were splitting up and\n   it was a super drastic change. After they split up, I actually moved to\n   Cali for a while. As soon as my parents split up, my mom knew that she\n   wouldn't be able to sustain us so she moved out to Cali. We lived with her\n   uncle for a while. Yeah, we lived there in Cali for a year. Eventually, I\n   moved out back to ___ with my dad.\n \n \n  "
