  "text":"Noe: Well, to get me into, how you say, the living style over there. I\n   adapted very well. I graduate, I start moving by myself. I move into my own\n   apartment. My own connections. After that, I became a chef. It was a little\n   bit of an expert on the kitchen. I got an offer, a job offer, from Iowa\n   about a restaurant opening. They offered me a pretty good salary, and I\n   didn't have to pay rent, so I didn't think twice about moving out there. I\n   opened the restaurant. They were really happy with my work. They were doing\n   very well. I set up everything right.\n \n \n  "
