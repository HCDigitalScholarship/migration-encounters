  "text":"Ivan: Well, it was up and downs. I had to work. I had to go to school and\n   take care of my siblings because my mom was working all the time. So I\n   would go to high school but the time I went to 10th grade, I started\n   working, part-time. So I would go to school, work, and the weekends take\n   care of my siblings. But my mom managed to take us out from time to time.\n   So she would take a day off and just go out to the water park. And that was\n   new to me. Like everything in the States, everything I would go. Especially\n   the water park, when I went the first time, I was like, \u201cWhatttt!\u201d. Yeah. I\n   didn't know things like that, the slides. That was so incredible. So I will\n   say that it was up and downs. Definitely when I drove to work, I always\n   afraid because I might get stopped or anything.\n \n"
