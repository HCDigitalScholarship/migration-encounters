  "text":"Mike: Yeah. I didn't go to school, because my dad thought that if something\n   happened... And I remember one time the cops came to my house, because my\n   little brother was playing outside and it was school hours. And they're\n   like, \"What is this kid doing outside?\" And I remember him crying outside,\n   because the cops got him. And I was like, \"Oh my God, what do I do?\"\n \n \n   Mike: So I opened the door and my little brother rushes in crying. And\n   then, I don't know, by the grace of God, they left us alone, but they told\n   us that we had to be in school, this and that. And from there we moved. A\n   month later, that's when he got caught up with the thing.\n \n \n   Anne: So basically he would go to work, and you would be in charge of the\n   kids?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: That's a lot of responsibility to put on\u2014\n \n \n  "
