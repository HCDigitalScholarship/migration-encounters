  "text":"They would ask me, \"So why are you in here for?\" I didn't want to\n   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or\n   like, \"Yeah, I'm hard, too.\" I was like, \"No, I'm just here because I'm\n   illegal.\" Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching\n   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, \"So, why are you here?\" \"I'm\n   just illegal.\" They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a\n   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually \u2013\n   They had my back. It was like, \"You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.\n   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?\" They gave me food, they\n   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.\n \n \n  "
