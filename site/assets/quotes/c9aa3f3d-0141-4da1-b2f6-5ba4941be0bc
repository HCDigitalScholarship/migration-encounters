They'll see you\n   and they'll just reject you, because \u201cOh, you didn't have an answer,\u201d or\n   you didn't know how to speak correctly or formal with them. They'll just\n   get mad at that. That's one of the reasons I decided to come to the city. I\n   was like, \u201cNo, I'm not staying here.\u201d\n \n \n  "
