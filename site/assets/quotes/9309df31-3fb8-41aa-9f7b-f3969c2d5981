  "text":"Edgar: So back here, I ended up, I actually came with a friend. We didn't\n   land here. We landed in Guadalajara. Then, from there, we went to Michoac\u00e1n\n   with his family. I don't know why. But one day, we just decided we're going\n   to come back. We didn't really think about that we couldn't go back after\n   we got here. So, yeah. When we got here, we were like, \"Damn. Now what do\n   we do? Now that we can't go back.\"\n \n \n  "
