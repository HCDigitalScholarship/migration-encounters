  "text":"\n Billy: Yeah. There's another reason as to why I came. I'm just going to go\n ahead and tell it. This is very personal, but I don't care. So, my dad, he\n started getting involved with another woman. This white girl. She had a\n farm. She was more like a country girl. She was all about the country life.\n So, my dad got involved with her and we ended up moving to a farm with her\n and I was on the farm with them. It was awesome, to be honest, I had my own\n little go-cart and I was working with horses. Had my own room.\n      \n      \n Billy: But then I would see them kissing and I would see them hugging and\n that was just too much for me bro. It was too much knowing that my mom was\n here in Mexico, busting her ass, and my dad is doing that. I'm like, \"Bro,\n you're tripping, dude, doing this in front of me, man.\" I just felt\n disrespected. I'm like, \"You know I love you, dad, but you're not very\n considerate.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So, I just got the money, I'm like, \"I'm just going to leave. It's\n better that I don't see this because I'm going to end up getting stressed\n out and pissed off.\u201d So, I'm like, \"I'm just going to go to Mexico. I'm\n going to be happy with my family, eating good food and save myself some\n stress.\"\n      \n     "
