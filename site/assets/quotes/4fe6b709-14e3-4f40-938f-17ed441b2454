  "text":"Luisa: I wanted to get into a good university. I was like, \"Okay, high\n   school's fine. Okay, whatever. We're going to make do. I'm going to be the\n   best student wherever I am.\" So I started swimming, track, volleyball,\n   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it\n   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a\n   bunch of community work\u2014I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog\n   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,\n   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,\n   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.\n \n \n  "
