  "text":"Claudia: My first question for you is why did you or your family decide to\n   leave Mexico, and how did you cross the border?\n \n \n   Yosell: Let\u2019s see. I think I was about three or four months old when I\n   crossed the border the first time. It was just, you're going to cross the\n   border, and so I crossed the border through, it was TJ [Tijuana] at the\n   time. And I was living in San Francisco for maybe like two years. After\n   that, from what my dad tells me, and to what I remember, we were just\n   moving around the U.S., and quite a couple of places.\n \n \n   Yosell: From what I do remember, I used to live in Vegas with an aunt\n   there. I was doing my elementary school and then after that I moved out to\n   Utah and started doing a little bit of my middle school and after that I\n   was kind of moving around a lot of places, I guess just working\u2014my dad got\n   me a job working for construction. And I was doing my high school online, a\n   kind of homeschool thing. That was pretty interesting. I would come back to\n   Mexico quite often. I would kind of just jump the border and come see my\n   mom, and then I jumped it again.\n \n \n   Claudia: And you would go back?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah.\n \n \n   Claudia: How many times did you say that you did that?\n \n \n   Yosell: Six or eight times just jumping it.\n \n \n   Claudia: You were over there without your parents or anybody?\n \n \n   Yosell: With my dad. I was already with my dad.\n \n \n   Claudia: How did it feel to be separated from your mom?\n \n \n   Yosell: I don't know if it would be a big thing since I was always kind of\n   with my dad, and I would see my mom almost every... I would come back every\n   Mother's Day or Christmas kind of thing. Come back to see her, and then I\n   would just basically just jump it again. Since dad knew people that would\n   cross the border quite often, that's where they would do it.\n \n \n  "
