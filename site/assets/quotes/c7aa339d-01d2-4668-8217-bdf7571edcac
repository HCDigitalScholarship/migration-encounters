  "text":"Anne: So when did you stop feeling for your family, and feeling like you'd\n   fit into Christmas and such?\n \n \n   Mike: That was going on high school. I think it was my freshman year,\n   because like I said man, it's just all these things that happen to you,\n   there's just only so much you could take to where you're like, \"You know\n   what? Eff it.\" You're just done with everybody and you're just like, \"You\n   know what? If life paid me back like this, then why should I care?\" You\n   know what I mean? And it makes me feel like inferior at times.\n \n \n  "
