  "text":"Anne: And then how long where you in Mexico before you tried to go back?\n \n \n   Hugo: About a year. 11 months, almost a year. And then my father was going\n   to help me, he was going to pay for the coyote\u2014$4,000-$5,000. But it\u2019s\n   okay, if you don't cross, you don't pay, so it's okay. They didn't spend\n   the money or anything.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you got caught at the border?\n \n \n  "
