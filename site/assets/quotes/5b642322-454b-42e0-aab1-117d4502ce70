  "text":"Anne: How about immigration? When you think about the immigration policy in\n   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?\n \n \n   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the\n   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in\n   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for\n   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing\n   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out\n   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go\n   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,\n   maybe look into those parents and help them.\n \n \n   Juan: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't\n   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in\n   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been\n   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years\n   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my\n   mom, who's a home \u2026 How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of\n   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not\n   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.\n   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who\n   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who\n   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But\n   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking\n   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.\n \n \n   Juan: Maybe help them, provide them with DACA or something like that. A\n   program for them.\n \n \n  "
