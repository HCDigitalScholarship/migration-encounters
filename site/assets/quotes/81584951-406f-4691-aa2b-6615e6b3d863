  "text":"Yes. Yes, I did. I didn't know it, I was just [mumbling 00:46:07] didn't\n     know. But then I learned it. I remember we used to do the Pledge of\n     Allegiance, it was every morning, every morning. After that, I don't know\n     what happened to schools. They stopped doing it, but it was every day. I\n     used to do it every day. The Pledge of Allegiance. I even learned the\n     American anthem, but all of a sudden everything started changing. I really\n     don't know why. Times change. Things change. It reminds me a lot when I\n     used to ride my bicycle to school, put the lock on it. I felt like in the\n     movies. When I was little, I felt like I was in the movies, because of me\n     on a bicycle, putting my bicycle and locking it. I felt like the Back to\n     the Future guy, and I always wanted some Nikes like this guy. It was\n     difficult for the language. It was difficult for the culture because it got\n     me mixed up with the American culture and Chicano culture. There was a big\n     division there because I had to learn from both.\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     That's when you get like a Chicano burrito, Americans potato, mashed\n     potatoes in this. Then, okay, Chicano goes to LA Dodgers stadium, and he's\n     American. Cinco de Mayo, he's Mexican. What's going on? It's like, what's\n     going on with this guy? But then American culture, [sings] \u201ctake me out to\n     the ballgame.\u201d I asked my mom a lot of stuff. I asked my dad a lot of\n     stuff, and I believe I mentioned when you asked me how I felt, American or\n     Mexican? That's what they taught me. \"You're Mexican. You're Mexican, you\n     know the pyramids. You been there, you studied there. You remember this?\"\n     \"Yes.\" Okay. Then you're Mexican. You're not American, but you're learning\n     the American culture. Okay? Chicano, it's different. Way, totally,\n     completely out of, don't pay attention. Yes. Pay attention. But don't go\n     too much into it. You're Mexican.\"\n \n \n    "
