That's when my baby,\n   I knew he was going to be born, or he was born already. At that time, I\n   just wanted to do good for my family and try and grow up, because I always\n   took everything as a joke. I feel like I'm still 18 and I'm 26 already. I\n   feel like I didn't have a chance to live my childhood.\n \n \n  "
