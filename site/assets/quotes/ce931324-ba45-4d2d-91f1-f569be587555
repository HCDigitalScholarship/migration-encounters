  "text":"Isabel: Yeah. Yeah, that's also kind of some rhetoric we hear is, when\n   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,\n   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you\n   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.\n \n \n   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, \"You're about to\n   turn 18. You go to Mexico.\" I was talking about going to college, and he\n   said, \"Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here.\" I was like,\n   \"Well, why not?\" He was like, \"Have you ever heard of a student loans?\" I\n   was like, \"I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it.\" But I\n   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.\n   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to\n   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.\n \n \n   Isabel: No, I know.\n \n \n   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, \"We can't afford to pay\n   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,\n   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with\n   them.\" So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last\n   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.\n \n \n   Isabel: What was difficult?\n \n \n   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to\u2014I\n   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I\n   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and\n   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in\n   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.\n \n \n  "
