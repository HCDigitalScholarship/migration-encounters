  "text":"Anne: So what are your dreams now? I mean you talked a bit about your\n   dreams in the U.S how they kept getting sort of barriers and you'd have to\n   cut back, what about now on your dreams?\n \n \n   Luis: Oh, right now I'm really ambitious. I noticed that nothing's going to\n   be given to me and I need to take what I want. So right now, I just want to\n   be the best programmer in Mexico City. And I think I can achieve it. And\n   even, I don't know, move somewhere else\u2026 somewhere where my values, because\n   I have really different values from like Mexican people, I'm really\n   disciplined, I'm really honest. I'm extremely... I don't know how to say\n   it. I'm really different, I guess. Even when people throw cigarettes on the\n   floor it really bothers me. So, yeah, move somewhere like, I don't know,\n   Singapore or something, where they're really strict because that's how I\n   am. My dream is just to maybe move with her and her family\u2014so they can\n   avoid so much violence as well\u2014to somewhere else. Maybe even Canada. Canada\n   sounds good.\n \n \n  "
