  "text":"Carlos: Yeah, in ___ Oregon. What basically they told me after the 10 days,\n   \"All right, you need to come back to Mexico.\" I needed to come back, so\n   that's why they deported me. I don't know what, but they got it, too, with\n   the lawyer and the judge and everything, but I had to come back to Mexico.\n   After that, after my grandma knew about that, she came back immediately\n   because she has been taking care of me for almost 19 years. Almost 20.\n   Yeah, almost all my life.\n \n \n  "
