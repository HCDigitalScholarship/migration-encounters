  "text":"is your family\n   still in the States?\n \n \n   Ilse: Yes, they are.\n \n \n   Claudia: Have you seen them?\n \n \n   Ilse: I have not seen them in eight years.\n \n \n   Claudia: So, tell me about that, if you feel comfortable.\n \n \n   Ilse: It's tough, it's so tough. I've always been so close to my mom and my\n   brother, you have no idea. The first few years, I guess, because I was\n   always so overprotected\u2014my dad was overprotective of me in the States, and\n   I wasn't able to go out or anything\u2014honestly, the first year, two years, I\n   was free, you know? [Laughs]. I could do whatever I wanted, I lived on my\n   own, you know?\n \n \n   Ilse: But then it just got to me. The third year was so bad. So bad because\n   there was a point in time that I had economic issues, and had to reach out\n   to my parents, and I was like, \"Help me out a little bit?\"\n \n \n   Ilse: But it was more than not having enough money or whatever, it was just\n   not having my mom by my side, telling me everything was going to be okay.\n   And I mean, so far, I never tell them my problems because they can't do\n   anything about it, you know? I can't call my mom and tell her that I'm sad\n   or that I'm... I don't know, because she can't do anything. She's so far.\n   [Emotional]. I'm so sorry.\n \n \n   Claudia: Don't worry. Take your time.\n \n \n   Ilse: And my brother got married a year ago. I wasn't able to be there. You\n   know? [Crying]. I'm so sorry.\n \n \n   Claudia: Don't worry.\n \n \n   Ilse: He's always been my everything, and it was so hard not to be there\n   for him. And, well, he's going to be a dad. And I'm not going to be able to\n   see my little niece. Oh, sorry, it's just like...But I know we'll be\n   together someday, and I'm working so hard because I know I'm not a bad\n   person. I think that I should be able to get a visa to be able to go back.\n   I'm not going to stay, you know? I just want to see my family. I'm so\n   sorry. [Crying].\n \n \n   Claudia: Don't worry. It's totally okay.\n \n \n   Ilse: Yeah. But, yeah, it's hard.\n \n \n  "
