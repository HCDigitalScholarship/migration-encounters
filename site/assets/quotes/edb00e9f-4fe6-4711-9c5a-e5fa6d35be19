  "text":"Brenda: When I was going to graduate, the town that we lived in, Tahlequah,\n had a small regional college and Northeastern State. My plan was like,\n \u201cWell maybe I can just get a job at the restaurant, whatever, save up\n money,\u201d because they did accept people without any papers. But obviously,\n you paid a lot more money. I was like, I guess I\u2019ll do that, or I'll figure\n out what to do. Eventually, as the time got closer and we knew I was going\n to have to come to Mexico, I was like, \u201cWell maybe we'll see.\u201d I just kept\n saying like, \u201cWe\u2019ll wait and see,\u201d because I did want to do my college in\n the US because that's what I knew up until then.\n      \n      \n"
