  "text":"Luisa: I'm pretty sure if I wasn't going to be an oncologist, maybe a\n   neuroscientist or a neurosurgeon. People like me, I'm driven, man. I'm\n   extremely driven. When you grow up with all of these people telling you\n   that you can't, you want it more and you want it more and you have this\n   hunger inside of you that you want it and you need it and you're going to\n   make it, and I'm pretty sure I could run laps around all these fuckers that\n   were born citizens. So they did\u2014they lost somebody who can better society.\n   I'm pretty sure I had a lot to offer \u2026 in a lot of senses.\n \n \n  "
