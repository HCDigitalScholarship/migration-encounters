  "text":"Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't\n   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted\n   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my\n   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I\n   was like, \"Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.\" I wanted to be an\n   oncologist\u2014yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't\n   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want\n   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in\n   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.\n \n \n   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it\n   came down to it, my mom was like, \"No. You know what? You can't. You don't\n   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to\n   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your\n   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm\n   sorry.\"\n \n \n  "
