  "text":"Ben: That's all I can do. But I'm still grateful I did very well and my\n family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all\n and head back. But, they're comfortable, they're doing well. And I think,\n well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive\n because they all had, including my wife, when we married she was kind of\n shy and her self-esteem\u2014not that she had low self-esteem\u2014but she really\n didn't believe that much in herself. But right now, she's shining, she's\n doing really well, and she's holding it together for both kids at that age\n to still be living with her, other than my son right now in college, that\n he went, that's to say a lot for two parents. But for a single parent, you\n gotta hand it to her.\n      \n      \n"
