I don't know why, but I really can't. [Chuckles].\n   It's weird because the thing that I remember is a smell, a certain smell\n   that when you get a cold and you get sick. It's so distinguishing that if I\n   smell it, it'll just throw me back. I can't really describe the smell, but\n   it's just one thing.\n \n \n  "
