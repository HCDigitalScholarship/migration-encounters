  "text":"Axel: Obviously, I'm not going to risk it. I didn't believe him at the same\n time, but since they do always take money and any other types of bribes, so\n I'm like, I'm not going to risk it, try to play the brave guy and be like,\n \"All right, go ahead and take me,\" and stuff, and then they do it, and then\n I'm going to be like, \"Oh no, never mind.\" They might even end up taking\n both of my phones or anything like that. I have friends that because they\n said no and they refused to give the phone, they put it inside their pants\n so the cops couldn't get it, they ended up beating them up. They would just\n grab them and beat them and, \"All right, there you go. You can go on about\n your merry way. We didn't get nothing from you, but we at least gave you a\n beating. Maybe you'll learn.\"\n      \n      \n"
