  "text":"Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that\n   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad\n   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like\n   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the\n   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my\n   mom.\n \n \n  "
