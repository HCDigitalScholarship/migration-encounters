I know that I'm like 40 minutes away from you,\n   but I could go. Really. You just hit me up if you need more.\" And 10\n   minutes later, \"Are you sure that you don't need me today?\" [Loud voice].\n   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,\n   especially when they're together. So, I was like, \"Yeah, I need to get away\n   from here.\"\n \n \n  "
