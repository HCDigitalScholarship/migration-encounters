  "text":"Anne: When you think about your own identity, do you think of yourself as a\n   Mexican? As an American?\n \n \n   Miguel: Oh no as Mexican, as Hispanic. But I think I'm more Americanized.\n   That's the thing, that I got more used to the culture out there, their\n   customs and things like that. But I think like yeah I\u2019m Hispanic, I'm\n   Mexican, but I'm a little bit more Americanized and I have, you know I'm\n   more used to the things from over there. Like, I think I could get along\n   better with people out there than over here. Really it's for a lot of\n   reasons but yeah, I would consider myself more from over there than from\n   over here. But like they say you're not even from there, you're not even\n   from here, you're like in the between. But yeah.\n \n \n  "
