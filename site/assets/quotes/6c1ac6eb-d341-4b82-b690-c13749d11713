  "text":"I said, \"Hey, I think I\n   should be doing that. I'm not sure.\" Then once I just got pulled over and I\n   said, \"Oh, I'm American. I've been here my whole life. I have my\n   documents.\" They actually told me, \"Well, you're right about some things,\n   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,\n   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why\u201d I said, \"Oh,\n   okay. So, we are illegal.\" That's when I confirmed it, I guess. In the back\n   of my mind, I thought I was, but I never actually officially heard it or\n   knew about it.\n \n \n  "
