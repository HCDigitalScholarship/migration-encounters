  "text":"Ana: That the States has given me, I actually do feel that it has shaped me\n in many ways to be where I am now more than the States itself though. It's\n weird because you don't really... I feel like you don't really know how\n much is your parent, how much is your culture, how much is your siblings?\n So for me, English is number one. I think I really enjoy the culture that\n they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having\n worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to\n do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been\n really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very\n different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they\n are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up\n in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's\n to the point and it's not about just...\n      \n      \n Ana: For example, one of the things where I was discussing, previously or\n last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if\n I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up. And not necessarily,\n not talking about rudely, just I speak up when it's normally not done here.\n People tend to accept or just sit back and let things slide by. And I don't\n think that that's something that happens a lot in the States, or didn't,\n not speaking about the current government, but when I grew up there, it was\n just flu\u2014I remember that things were fluid. And I don't know if that's also\n because as a kid, you don't notice or know of all the issues that are going\n on around, but yeah, I would say to summarize: English, definitely; the\n working mentality of no beating around the bush and directness; and kind of\n going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get\n your point across without hurting others.\n      \n      \n"
