  "text":"Luis: I sure hope so because if I could, I\u2019d go back and sit and tell him\n   how much I love him, how much I was grateful for him raising me, of making\n   me the man that I am today. I just feel so much regret of not doing the\n   things that I was supposed to do. You know?\n \n \n   Anita: He'd be pretty proud of you if he could hear you now.\n \n \n   Luis: I hope. Whenever they talk about heaven or hell or stuff like that, I\n   don't really believe in God or something like that, but if it exists, God,\n   I sure hope he's not angry with me.\n \n \n   Anita: He\u2019s not angry at you. He loved you deeply. You were a good kid.\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah, thanks. [Pause]. I'm sorry. I just, I don't know how to deal\n   with this. I still don't know how to deal with this.\n \n \n  "
