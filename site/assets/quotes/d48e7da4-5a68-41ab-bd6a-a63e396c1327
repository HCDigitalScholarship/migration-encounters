He's like, \"Maybe\n   because we've been gone for that long, maybe things have changed,\n   especially with the new president.\" But I said, \"No. Nothing has changed,\n   and I don't even know how it was back then, but it's horrible now. So I\n   think you should just stay.\u201d [Sometimes] my dad tells me over the phone,\n   \"I've been gone for so long -- since I was nineteen -- that I feel like if\n   I go back, I won't even feel like it's my home.\u201d He's just so used to the\n   culture there -- that's what he grew up with in his adult years.\n \n \n  "
