That\n   even though I'm here, if I made it out there I could make it out here. And\n   I just love America. There's nowhere else that's the same as that spot. It\n   taught me a lot of things and I feel like both of them are like my mother\n   countries. They're just like my stepmother. But I love both countries to\n   death.\n \n \n  "
