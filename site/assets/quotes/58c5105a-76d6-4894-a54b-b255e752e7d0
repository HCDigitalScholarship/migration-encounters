Then after\n   that, my mom called this guy, and he told her ... I think he told her that\n   she was arrested or something, and we stayed there for five, six hours. My\n   mom was really worried. She was worried about us because she didn't know\n   what was going to happen to us and stuff. My mom was crying, and I was just\n   sitting with her by her side.\n \n \n  "
