  "text":"Jose: Different stuff. I started working with this couple that did house\n   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we\n   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was\n   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house\n   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they\n   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint\n   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I\n   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and\n   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did\n   tile. I did flooring.\n \n \n   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the\n   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing\n   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty\n   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and\n   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.\n   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning\n   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a\n   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager\n   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and\n   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My\n   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a\n   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,\n   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.\n   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.\n   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came\n   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and\n   started living really good. But then this happened.\n \n \n  "
