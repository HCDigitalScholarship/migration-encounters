  "text":"And over here, when I started school, it was a little bit different.\n People do look at you different, everybody wants to ask you questions about\n over there, ask you how to say stuff. I'm not bothered by it, but it does\n get kind of annoying at some point. Everybody at all times, for every\n single thing. It's just like, everybody, at all times, for every single\n thing, and like people here go to school and they have English homework, I\n don't mind doing that, but then when we go somewhere and they're hanging\n out and every other thing, they're like, \"Hey, what is that? Or how you say\n this or how do you do that or how do you say that or what does that mean or\n what does this...\" It's like all right, I can't really do what I want to do\n because I got to go over here and translate everything else or tell you how\n to say all this other stuff just because. I don't mind, but it's like to a\n certain extent, at some point, I do want to think about doing my career for\n English. Pretty much being a teacher.\n      \n      \n"
