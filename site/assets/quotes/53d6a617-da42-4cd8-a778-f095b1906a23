  "text":"Jeimmy: I think that's something I really miss a lot, because here, you\n   could say, \"Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,\n   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to\n   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia\n   [they\u2019re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.\" So I\n   guess that's something that I missed too.\n \n \n   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police\n   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I\n   would always trust cops.\n \n \n   Tim: And here you don't trust?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a\n   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to\n   check them and see if they have anything on them.\n \n \n  "
