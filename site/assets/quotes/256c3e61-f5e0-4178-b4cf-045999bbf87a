  "text":"For me, I consider English my first language. It's really my\n strong point. My Spanish is... Even though I spoke it at home, once I got\n older, obviously I was always with my friends out playing video games,\n going to basketball games, football, just doing activities, so I was never\n home then. So my Spanish started going from pretty good to just like I can\n get by. And now, it's getting better now, but there's certain things that I\n still don't understand. That's why I found it a little bit harder when I\n started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their\n language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some\n bigger words that I don't understand.\n      \n      \n Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I\n also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling\n like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But\n it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words\n that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there\n in class like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?\"\n      \n      \n"
