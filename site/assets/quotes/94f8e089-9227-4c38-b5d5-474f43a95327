  "text":"Anne: Why did you come back?\n \n \n   Carolina: Mostly because we got tired of the same situation. We had family\n   there, but they lived really far away. So we didn't really communicate. We\n   were alone. It was just me, my mom, and my brother and sister. And that was\n   it. And we felt lonely. We felt like we didn't have anybody there. So we\n   decided to come back.\n \n \n   Anne: So the whole family came back together?\n \n \n   Carolina: Yes. But my siblings are constantly going back.\n \n \n   Anne: Oh, because they're US citizens?\n \n \n   Carolina: Yes.\n \n \n  "
