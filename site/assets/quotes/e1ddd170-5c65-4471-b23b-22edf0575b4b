  "text":"Anne: You talked about your association with kids that weren't the best in\n   high school. Did you get in trouble?\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: Did you actually get arrested?\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah. A couple of times. But it was my high school year, so it\n   never stayed in my record, but I was getting in trouble constantly. And I\n   liked it, because my parents would have to suffer. That's the sucky thing\n   about it. Looking back at it now, I put my mom through a lot of stuff, and\n   it sucks.\n \n \n   Anne: So what kind of crimes did you commit?\n \n \n   Mike: Basically it was just petty things. They would always catch us for\n   skipping school. One time I remember my friend went into a gas station and\n   stole some cigarettes, which is\u2014how do you grab the cigarettes in the back\n   counter? And I was with that guy. Fights. I also loved fighting. It's just\n   a way of me just getting my anger out.\n \n \n   Mike: I got a lot of disorderly conducts and it was for fighting. It's just\n   something about fighting that just releases the stress. It just releases my\n   anger. And since I didn't want to take it on my family, I would just\n   always, whoever wanted it, I'd be the first one to step in. And it's crazy\n   because I was the shortest one I remember. I was the shortest one man.\n \n \n   Mike: I used to hang out with a lot of black people, so I was always the\n   shortest one. I was always doing the most man. And I was like, \"Dude,\n   what's wrong with you?\" Then everybody would be like, \"Dude, calm down.\"\n   You're like one of those mad chihuahuas. And I was like, \"Dude, you're so\n   right. I got to stop, man. I got to stop.\" Which is crazy.\n \n \n  "
