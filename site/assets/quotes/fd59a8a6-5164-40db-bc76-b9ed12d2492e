Don't\n   mention things about the family and all of that stuff.\u201d He almost made it\n   look like, \"Don't say you're Mexican. Just say you're really tan.\" That's\n   it. [Laughs]. If they ask you, you're really tan. That's it. I was like,\n   \"Okay. I'll try my best. I think it's pretty obvious that we're not here,\n   but I'll try.\"\n \n \n  "
