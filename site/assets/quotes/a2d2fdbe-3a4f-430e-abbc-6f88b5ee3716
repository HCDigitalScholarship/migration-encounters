  "text":"My\n   next, my daughter is eighteen and just graduated from high school. And she\n   is going to join the army. And she leaves in July and I'm going to hate not\n   to be there to say goodbye and hug her. I just hate the idea of her leaving\n   for a long time, for almost a year, on the basic training, and I'm not\n   going to be able to be with her to say goodbye or give her a hug or\n   anything like that. And my youngest, she's a junior in high school. She has\n   two more years of high school and she wants to go to college.\n \n \n  "
