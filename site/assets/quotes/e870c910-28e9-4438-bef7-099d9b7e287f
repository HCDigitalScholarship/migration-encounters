It wasn't a\n   beer, but it was just a small glass from the bar that he took. They decided\n   to charge us both with open container. When I got into\u2014well they just\n   detained me. Well, they scanned me literally, they run all my information,\n   they didn't find any social security number. That's how they called ICE.\n   ICE literally detained me for about a month before I decided to sign on my\n   deportation because I was sick of the jail. I was just tired and\n   everything. I speak to the judge once, \u201cOkay, we'll see you for the next\n   court.\u201d I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d I was so sick already because I spent in County\n   for about four months as I remember, and then one more month with ICE. I\n   was just sick of it. I was like, \u201cNo, I just want to go.\u201d\n \n \n  "
