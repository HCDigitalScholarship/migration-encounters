  "text":"Mike: I started hanging out with the wrong kind of kids. These other kids\n   that wouldn't go to school and I noticed what type of kids I was hanging\n   out with. I noticed the difference, because there's productive people that\n   make you want to do better, and there's this people that just see you and\n   they want to see you do as bad as them.\n \n \n   Mike: So they kind of drag you down under. I felt like I just wanted to fit\n   in kind of because all my life I felt like I wasn't equal\u2014I don't know how\n   to explain it. It's just I just wanted to fit in kind of, not feel like I\n   wasn't as good as them, because I felt like I was always inferior, because\n   I didn't have the things that they had.\n \n \n  "
