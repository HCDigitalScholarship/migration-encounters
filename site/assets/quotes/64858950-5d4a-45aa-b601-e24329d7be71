Sometimes we lived with\n multiple families or a lot of our family that were coming over from Mexico.\n So little by little\u2014I think I shared a room with my brother until I was ten\n or twelve until we finally were able to get separated into our own rooms.\n But overall, I just remember always being with my parents and always\n feeling very, I guess happy they were together, and everybody was there.\n There was always a lot of people everywhere.\n      \n      \n"
