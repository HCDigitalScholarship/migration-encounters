  "text":"Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks\n   with them and these are the guys that tell me, \"I know everybody here. I\n   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.\" I walk with them and\n   they see when everybody's like, \"Hey, how have you been? Where have you\n   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?\n   Can I help you out in getting you some job?\" And they just look at me and\n   be like, \"Why are they interested on helping you?\" And that's when I tell\n   them \"That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,\n   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I\n   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.\" If they\n   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's\n   them. People are different.\n \n \n  "
