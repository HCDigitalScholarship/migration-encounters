  "text":"Mike: No, that was actually... She was still in high school. She was in\n   senior year I believe. I wasn't in high school anymore, I was working at\n   that time, working for the Solar Spot. I had barely started working for the\n   Solar Spot and she kind of gave me motivation to do better. When you have\n   somebody, you want to take them out and do extra stuff. So you're like,\n   \"Yeah man, I got to get this money.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And that was another motivation that helped me kind of get up at a\n   higher level than I was. But it was just a lot of stuff. When you have kids\n   young, you think you want something, but you don't know. It's just like you\n   think you like the person but you don't like them. You just like them for\n   their looks or their body, and that was my mistake. And yes, she actually\n   told me if I wanted to marry her.\n \n \n  "
