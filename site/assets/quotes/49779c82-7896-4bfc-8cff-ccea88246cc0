  "text":"Many: Well, when I came here, when I went back, it was hard for me to find\n   a job because I didn't have any papers, any ID or anything like that. So,\n   the only thing that I can do was\u2014I know how to drive\u2014one of my friends\n   offered me to work with him with a taxi and they gave me one. They gave me\n   a car to work for them. It was the first job that I have in Mexico after\n   getting deported. I started working in taxi and about three months after\n   the deportation, I got an assault for these guys. Like I was telling you,\n   they was two kids. They were like twenty years old, I think. I think they\n   were using drugs or something like that. They were high.\n \n \n   Many: So, one of them, they had a gun and I hear one of them told this guy\n   to shoot me, \"Shoot him, shoot him.\" And the other guy, I remember his face\n   through the mirror. I remember him. I was watching him and he was looking\n   at me. And he was pointing on the back of my head. So after that, I don't\n   remember. I don't remember because they shot me. And they take me to like\n   in a hill and they dumped me out of the car. They take the car, they take\n   the money and they put me on the ground."
