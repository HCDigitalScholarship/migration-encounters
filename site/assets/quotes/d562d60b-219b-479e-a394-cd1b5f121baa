  "text":"Olimpya: By the time we would leave the school, we would go eat and get\n   drunk again. Basically, that year, I was really drunk the whole time. My\n   mom, she noticed that, what was going on. She said, \"No, I'm taking you out\n   of that school. It's too expensive and you're not doing anything. You\n   already flunk every single class.\" I was like, \"Okay, no. Cooking class is\n   good.\" She would get mad at me, really mad. She's like, \"No, you're going\n   to another school, not so expensive, so you can value what you have. Come\n   on.\" So she signed me up in another school. It was less money where she\n   used to pay. The kids were other level. It wasn't beer. It was tequila. It\n   was everything you can find. [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
