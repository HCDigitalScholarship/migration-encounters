  "text":"Yeah. It was very fun. It was very different. Each country has a\n   different way of their system of education. What I liked a lot is that\n   mostly you get free lunch up in the States, and you get a lot of courses\n   that are free, and summer activities in school, and they're also free.\n   That's very different because right here, you got to pay for them. I liked\n   it a lot. It's different. I remember my school, they had a big park for a\n   court of tennis, basketball, baseball.\n \n \n   Anne: Did you play sports?\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah, I did. I loved soccer, but in that time, I also played\n   basketball. I also, how do you call it? Running?\n \n \n   Anne: Track? Track?\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah, I like track. Yeah, exactly, and a little bit of baseball,\n   too.\n \n \n   Anne: That's cool.\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah, it is very cool.\n \n \n   Anne: How about other types of activities at school? Did you do art? Did\n   you do music?\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah, I did music for some time. I also did chess, but they're not\n   my strong, right? I also did robotics, something like that. Yeah. Mostly I\n   was up into physical education.\n \n \n  "
