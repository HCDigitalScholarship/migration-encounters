  "text":"Anita: Oh, it's a call center. Do you feel safe in Mexico?\n \n \n   Melani: So far I do, but my grandmother always tells me to be careful\n   because there's a lot of people being kidnapped, or stealing, by the\n   cartels. When I went back to my grandmother's house on my mom's side, she\n   told me that there have never been cartels there until two years ago [when]\n   a cartel came into the state and took possession of the state. They're\n   everywhere now, and since they're there they threaten people that if\n   they're not home by a certain hour, they'll kill them, and they do. And\n   they charge every house [they have] to pay them a quota for their safety,\n   and even though you pay that, you still get assaulted. My grandparents have\n   recently begun looking for another house because they're really scared --\n   since there's so many murders and killings and assaults and a lot of\n   robberies. They're scared, and I'm even scared for them. I think Mexico\n   City is safer in that aspect, but danger is everywhere here.\n \n \n  "
