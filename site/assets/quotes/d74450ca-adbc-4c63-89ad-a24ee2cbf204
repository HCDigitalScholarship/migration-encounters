  "text":"Luis: I mean I work at a call center, but you cannot really work and study\n   at the same time in Mexico. Because here the idea of a part time job is six\n   to eight hours. So that's a part time job, anyway. And the regular job is\n   like ten hours. It's crazy. Anyway, so, I talked to my parents and they're\n   like, \u201cYou know what, we are going to support you, while you do your\n   university.\u201d And at this time, I also meet a girl, she becomes my partner.\n   She's still my partner right now. And she just encourages me to apply to a\n   public school and we applied together and we ended up going to this\n   university together. And five years later, we finish top of the class and\n   yeah, it was great. There the sad part is that, the actual degree, I\n   don't have it because they're giving me some bureaucratic problems because\n   of my high school. So yeah, this is a ridiculous\u2014one thing after another!\n \n \n  "
