  "text":"Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in\n   gangs?\n \n \n   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well\n   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick\n   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking\n   you and poking you saying, \"What are you doing? What do you have in your\n   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.\"\n   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are\n   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards\n   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me\n   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I\n   do?\n \n \n   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type\n   of anger like, \"Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?\""
