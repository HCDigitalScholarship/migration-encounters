  "text":"Axel: It was just really fun. That was the only thing that I wouldn't\n consider bullying, my friends were just more like a teasing type thing.\n Saying about the money. He's like, \"Oh yeah.\" I don't know why, he's like,\n \"Why don't you take us out to eat?\" He's like, \"You're the one with money.\"\n It was just funny to me. Then later on, they would have some racist jokes\n in a way, but I knew that they were friends. I knew that it was just\n teasing, messing around. It was never really serious.\n      \n      \n Anne: Right, right.\n      \n      \n Axel: Sometimes it would be like, \"Wow, your people don't have a lot of\n money, blah, blah, blah.\" And then sometimes it was like, \"No, you don't\n count. You're not even from here.\" It was always funny. It was never really\n a serious... I never had really serious issues with school and bullying,\n nothing like that. It was always pretty fun.\n      \n      \n"
