  "text":"Ivan: And learning a new language, that was definitely a challenge. It took\n   me about three years to fully understand the language. I think most of the\n   difficulties had, it was like I was shy. I was shy speaking another\n   language. I'll always think like, \u201cOh maybe they will not understand me.\u201d\n   That's something that always kept me not moving on. Because I was always\n   shy. I was always afraid, but I don't know. One time, I just started\n   talking, that's when I started working. I was like, well, I have to\n   communicate. So I started not being shy anymore. And school was a really\n   good experience.\n \n"
