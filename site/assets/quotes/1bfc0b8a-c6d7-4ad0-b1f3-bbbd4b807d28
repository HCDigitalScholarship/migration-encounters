But then, one day, he\n   saw a sign that said, \"We need welders.\" And he's like, \"Oh, necesitan\n   soldadores, [the need welders] but I don't know how to weld. But I'm going\n   to go anyway.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, he found the supervisor and he's like, \"Oh, you're Mexican,\n   huh?\" He's like, \u201cYeah.\u201d \"Oh, okay. Well then.\" And my dad is like,\n   \u201c[Nervous noise].\u2019 It was horrible, but he's like, \"Okay, I'm going to show\n   you how to weld.\" So my dad started learning how to be a welder and became\n   an ingeniero industrial.
