  "text":"\n Billy: And jazz helped me discover that because it's like a chain. African\n American people help each other out through their music, that helped other\n people out, that helped me out. Eventually I took my friend out of a heroin\n addiction because of that, because of the music. And I started crying when\n he told me. He was like, \"Dude, I just wanted to thank you because you took\n me out of my heroin addiction.\" I actually did something. So that music was\n really important for me. It gave me an identity.\n      \n      \n Anita: So, you were attracted to African American blues and jazz?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, because my brother was listening to it and so I'm like, \"Dude,\n what are you listening to? This is weird We usually listen to rock.\" He's\n like, \"Man, this is called blues, bro. This is a really cool music, and it\n has to do with African American people back in the day and it tells the\n story of America.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So, I just looked into it and I became obsessed with it. I couldn't\n stop. Once I discovered Louis Armstrong, that was just it. I could not stop\n playing jazz and so yeah, in North Carolina, I was just feeling kinda\n crappy and that music came at the perfect time.\n      \n     "
