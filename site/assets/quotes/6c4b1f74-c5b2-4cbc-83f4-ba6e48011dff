  "text":"Ilse: And so, going to high school, I tried really hard, I had really good\n   grades, I graduated third in my class. I was so into volunteering, I was in\n   the student council, I did sports, I did everything. I wanted to be perfect\n   so I could get scholarships. But it got to a point that I finally\n   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I\n   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go\u2014which was never my idea.\n   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the\n   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I\n   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, \"I've tried so\n   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay\n   here.\" So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, \"Dad, I really, really\n   want to go to college.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: And he's like, \"But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too\n   expensive.\" And he's like, \"You either stay here and work, and try to go\n   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, \"Well, Mexico's my country, my\n   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so\n   might as well just leave.\" So, right after college [means, high school] I\n   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.\n   And I just decided to leave, to start over.\n \n \n  "
