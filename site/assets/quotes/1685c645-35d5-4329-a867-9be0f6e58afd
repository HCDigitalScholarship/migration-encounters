  "text":"Mike: So they were like, \"Dude, you got to do something. You either going\n   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to\n   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do\n   a voluntary departure and you go.\" At that time I felt like I wasn't any\n   good to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on my family.\" So I just\n   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran\n   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was\n   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I\n   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just\n   said, \"Screw it.\"\n \n \n  "
