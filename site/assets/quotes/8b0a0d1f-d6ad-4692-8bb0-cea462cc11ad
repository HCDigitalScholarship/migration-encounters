  "text":"Anne: Yes. I don't think I have any more questions, but is there something\n   you would like to share to the people who might listen to this interview\n   that you might not have said thus far that tells us more about you, your\n   experiences as a returning migrant, anything at all?\n \n \n   Laura: Well, when I returned to Mexico, it was really complicated. When I\n   returned in Mexico they didn't have those programs. I already told to the\n   other girl, and I tell her like, this is the first program in about seven\n   years that I found that actually got interest in immigrants like us. If I\n   would find a program that actually support you for being an immigrant or\n   something like that, I will take it. But I didn't know if you were\n   bilingual you get paid more.\n \n \n   Laura: I actually learned that when I was 25, 24-years-old, and that was\n   like when I was five years later in Mexico. If they had more programs that\n   supported immigrants, that would be great. If they give them like the\n   support because it's really complicated. It's a cultural shock. You are in\n   the U.S. and they have a perspective of everything and when you get into\n   Mexico, it is complicated.\n \n \n   Laura: They do not accept you because you were living in the US. They were\n   like, \"Oh you chose to get into the US? Go back.\" Some of those comments,\n   so it's really a shock. They should put more programs that support\n   immigrants in Mexico.\n \n \n   Anne: What kind of programs do you think?\n \n \n   Laura: Like this one, like they help you to look for a job. They provide\n   you more information because I didn't know that you had to certify your\n   certificates from high school and all your transcripts before you can be\n   here. So, it was complicated because I have to send the transcript from my\n   school to my mom, so she can get them certified in the U.S., and then go\n   back to Mexico. Those kind of programs that inform you about those issues\n   or re-integrate you in the culture on the population in Mexico, or\n   something. I don't know. Those kind of programs.\n \n"
