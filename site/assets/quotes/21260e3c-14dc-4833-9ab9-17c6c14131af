  "text":"Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,\n   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,\n   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white\n   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know\n   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop\n   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in\n   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, \"Okay, it's\n   normal.\" There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that\n   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the\n   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown\n   and things like that. I guess that was just it.\n \n \n  "
