Some jobs did not accept me because I don\u2019t have the high school\n   diploma\u2014that's why I'm trying to get it. Luckily, T-Tech they accept you.\n   They don't really care about the high school diploma, it's not an issue. As\n   long as you do the job right and you know how to do the job, they'll hire\n   you.\n \n \n  "
