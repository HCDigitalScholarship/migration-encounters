  "text":"I was in sixth grade when I moved in with my aunt. I\n   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that\n   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, \"Hey, why fight?\n   We can play. We can do something else.\u201d [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to\n   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you\n   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in\n   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, \"I'm just\n   going to leave.\" Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was\n   like, \"Why are you running?\" [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was\n   just like, \"Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down\n   here.\" They came. Then they asked me, \"What was going on?\" I was like,\n   \"They started fighting. I was sitting.\" Since they saw I wasn't scratch or\n   anything, they were like, \"Okay. Just go home.\" I remember that fight\n   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody\n   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, \"What?\"\n \n \n  "
