I don't know, a girlfriend, things like that. I was thinking\n   about my life and I say, \"Man, I can't stay here in Mexico, I just want to\n   go there and see what happens.\" So that's why I take the bus and I didn't\n   think about anything, I just take a little bit of money and went to the\n   train station and I just go.\n \n \n  "
