  "text":"Tim: Were people mean to you because you had spent time in the US?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yes, but I mean, okay. The first thing I noticed in Mexican school\n   is that they don't even have toilet paper in the bathrooms. So it's like,\n   \"Okay. Did somebody forget to put toilet paper?\" \"No, you have to bring\n   your own.\" I'm like, \"Okay, that's so weird.\" And then it's like, everybody\n   would think, I guess it's like they make themselves feel less because they\n   think that you think that you\u2019re better than them just because you know\n   English and you were in the States and so on.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So they would be like, \"ay la gringa se cree mucho porque viene de\n   los Estados Unidos y habla ingl\u00e9s.\u201d [the gringa is full of herself because\n   she\u2019s come from the United States and speaks English] It's like, \"No bro,\n   I'm nothing like that.\" So yeah, that was like ignorant children. But then\n   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, \u201cAy\n   Jeimmy, lee la p\u00e1gina tal\" [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I\n   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So I would be like, \"el carro\u201d [the car] and everybody would start\n   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,\n   di ferrocarril,\" [let\u2019s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American\n   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And\n   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four\n   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his\n   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, \"Oh my God,\n   this would not happen in the States.\" So it's really, really different.\n \n \n  "
