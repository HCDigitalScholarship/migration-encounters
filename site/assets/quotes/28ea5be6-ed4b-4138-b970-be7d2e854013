  "text":"Joana: I dropped out because I had personal issues with my mom and, well,\n   in my mind, I didn't think there was enough. I mean, even if I finished\n   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to\n   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what\n   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your\n   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?\n \n \n   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,\n   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you were a really good student?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best. Even if I missed a day, I was already\n   caught up. I always tried. My mom was really proud of me. I remember, she\n   kept all my diplomas.\n \n \n  "
