  "text":"Erik: And some people don't want to change. I work in a call center and we\n   do technical support. And you always talk with old people and say, \"I'm an\n   80 year old woman. Do not expect me to do no troubleshooting.\" People\n   resist those changes. So, I believe part of the discrimination is because\n   you are different. Either you act different, either you think different,\n   you know? Or you have just different customs.\n \n \n  "
