  "text":"Axel: When my mom calls me and tells me all that stuff about my family\n members, I don't get upset at my mom. My mom's like, \"Hey, they're all\n saying this and this and that.\" I'm like, \"Mom, just ignore them.\" She's\n like, \"No, how can you just ignore it?\" I'm like, \"Mom.\" I was like, \"Look,\n I never hear them say anything or see them say anything. You're the one\n that tells me. I get upset at you because you're telling me all this stuff\n that you already know and it's upsetting me that you get upset, and it\n upsets me that the fact that they're making you upset. I'm upset at you for\n letting them get you upset and I'm upset at them for even worrying about\n that stuff.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: You never worried about me when I was in the States and when I was\n going through all that jail time. None of you wanted to help me out with a\n recommendation card because you were like, \"Oh no, because if we put our\n information on there, they're going to have us on record and they're going\n to come looking for us.\" I'm like, \"No, it's nothing like that. They're not\n even asking for your address. They just want your name and they want you to\n write something good about me, something that you know about me. Stuff that\n you're saying that I'm a good person to society.\"\n      \n      \n"
