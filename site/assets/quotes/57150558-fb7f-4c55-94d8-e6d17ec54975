So my brothers and sisters seen\n   that and I was kind of like the black sheep, but I was like an example.\n   Like, \"Oh, don't be like him.\" So I feel like I wasn't there to help them,\n   or to actually guide them like a big brother should, but at least I was\n   like, \"Okay, don't be like him.\" You know what I mean?\n \n \n  "
