  "text":"Mike: I remember this is the first time that he played me too and I was\n   like, \"Oh I got to watch out for this guy.\" So they charged me 200 pesos to\n   do a whole bag of laundry, right? Well I hadn't remembered that when I\n   first moved in, I had a smaller bag of laundry and my dad gave me the\n   receipt and it was like 600 pesos, right?\n \n \n   Mike: A couple of months later I had gone to the laundry place and I had an\n   even bigger bag, because I had bought more clothes. So I know I had more\n   clothes than before. So they gave me the receipt, and it's written 200\n   pesos. I told my dad, \"Dad, remember the last time you told me that it was\n   this,\" he started laughing like in my face, like, \"Oh, what are you talking\n   about?\"\n \n \n   Mike: And that's when I knew I was like, \"Damn, I got to watch out for this\n   guy.\" You know what I mean? Because they love you, that's your family, but\n   they feel like you got it\u2014because you're from there, or you came from\n   there, or your family's going to support you. So he'd always try to get as\n   much as he could. That's why I felt like I got to kind of stay away from\n   him. Those are the people you've got to love, but keep your distance from.\n \n \n  "
