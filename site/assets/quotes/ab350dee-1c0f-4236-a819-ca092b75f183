  "text":"Miguel: Ciudad de Mexico. I had a teacher in University that used to say,\n   \"Miguel.\u201d It's like, \"No it's Miguel.\" She was Chicana. And she was like,\n   \"No, Miguel.\" She was really into embracing Mexican culture. So, I really\n   come from that tradition when I was living in California. Embracing, you\n   know? That's pretty cool."
