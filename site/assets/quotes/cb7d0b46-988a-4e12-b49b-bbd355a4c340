  "text":"Dan: Well, the attorney that I got, he knew that I didn't have documents at\n   that moment, so he's just like, \"Okay. Well, I'm going to try to make a\n   deal.\" He made a deal of\u2014there's a title that you call this, work\n   release\u2014that you turn yourself in on the weekends and then you go back to\n   work throughout the week. And then you turn back on the weekend and turn\n   yourself in. And that's what is supposed to happen, but I don't know how in\n   the world they knew I was there and I don't know what time they put the\n   hold on me. And then when I got there ... Well, when I tried to get out,\n   they told me I couldn't. They said, \"But don't worry. If they don't come to\n   pick you up, INS, by 8:00 in the morning, we'll let you go.\" And I had my\n   truck, everything on the parking lot. By, I guess it was 8:01, immigration\n   came and then the lady at the reception say, \"Hey, you want me to call the\n   other guys?\u201d He's like, \"No, I just came for that guy.\" And yeah, it was a\n   little bit rude. I treat them the way he was treating me. He was asking me\n   all these sorts of questions. I told him to talk to my attorney. And then\n   we got to Dallas, Texas at immigration offices, and I got left there all\n   night, basically, until I started yelling and screaming, and they said,\n   \"Oh! We forgot about you.\" They took me to a local jail to stay there\n   overnight. And then the next morning, that's when they just told me I was\n   going to be able to see an immigration judge. I think I waited for a couple\n   of months, three months. I turned myself in May ... it was May the 14th. My\n   father passed away May the 21st, and I was not there. Just a bunch of\n   things ran through my mind. But when I went to see the judge, they told me,\n   \"Hey, you were told that they were going to give you five years straight if\n   you would come back.\" And I served two years and a half. I was two years\n   and a half in jail at the border. It was Raymondville by Harlingen. I was\n   there working out, building myself up. I had to see the bright side. You\n   cannot focus on the negative things or else you get destroyed. I always try\n   to joke about sad situations because if I focus into the negative things,\n   nothing good comes out of it.\n \n \n  "
