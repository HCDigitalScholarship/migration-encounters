  "text":"So anyway, I started going into universities and trying to\n   apply to private universities because I wasn't even sure if I was going to\n   be eligible to going to a public university. So they keep telling me that\n   yeah, definitely if I have the money, but that also I need to formalize my\n   education by Mexican law, or something like that. And I didn't know\n   anything about that. So, I had to call my big brother to go to my high\n   school and ask for a\u2014not my diploma, because I had it\u2014but a transcript. And\n   go to the Department of State and ask for an apostille thing. And he did,\n   it took him like two years.\n \n \n   Anne: Yes.\n \n \n   Luis: Like he did it at the end. And yeah, I was able to get it. And then\n   here I went to the offices, they have a high school division that takes\n   care of that. So I went there, and I give them all of my papers and stuff.\n   I had to translate everything and just pay some dude, some lawyer, to call\n   me every hour because he didn't speak English. So, I basically paid him, I\n   did his job and his assignment, and I had to pay him. Anyway, so, yeah,\n   that happened. And after two years of struggling with that, I was able to\n   finally have my high school accredited under Mexican law. So finally with\n   that I get into a private university, a cheap one because I have no real\n   income.\n \n \n  "
