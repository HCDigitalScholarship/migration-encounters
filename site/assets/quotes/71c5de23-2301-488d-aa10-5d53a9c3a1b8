  "text":"Well, since I learned that I was living illegally in the United States, I\n   got discriminated for that. They would call me \u201cillegal Mexican.\u201d So I took\n   that as a positive thing and said, \"Yes, I am,\" and I felt like I needed to\n   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because\n   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United\n   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to\n   represent them. I didn't get the tattoos until I came back to Mexico.\n   That's how it started. I do remember in high school, most of my friends\n   that I hung out with were all Mexican, we were all born in Mexico. I guess\n   that's how it started, just hanging out with friends and making jokes about\n   it.\n \n \n  "
