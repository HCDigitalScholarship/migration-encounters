  "text":"Ilse: When I was in Telvista, I started as a CSR, just answering calls, and\n   became mentor, and then I was a supervisor at 19, which was really hard\n   experience\u2014it was so tough\u2014but at the same time, it helped me so much and\n   it gave me the basics to work and be able to do what I do now. Then I\n   worked for the Western Union Corporate, the one that they have here in\n   Mexico. I was in Telvista for two years and a half, then Western Union for\n   a year and a half, and then I was sick and tired of call centers, I didn't\n   want to do that anymore.\n \n \n  "
