I was not the driver.\n   First, we got detained for swinging lines.\n \n \n   Lizzy: What?\n \n \n   Noe: Swinging lines, like roughly driving, like reckless driving. Well, we\n   were kind of a little bit of drinking. They were like, \u201cOkay, drinking and\n   driving.\u201d I was like, \u201cOh well.\u201d I thought I was not going to get arrested,\n   but the people decide to arrest me.\n \n \n  "
