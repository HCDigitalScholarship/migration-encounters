Back in the day, since we're kids, you would just go\n   as somebody else's kids.\n \n \n   Anne: I see.\n \n \n   Hugo: So, they just convinced us to say Daddy to some\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: Random person?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yeah. And they flew us over for a low low price. Back in the day it\n   was cheaper and safe because we were going in the airplane, you know?\n \n \n   Anne: Sure. You went just to L.A.? Went through customs, and there you\n   were.\n \n \n   Hugo: Yeah, straight to L.A."
