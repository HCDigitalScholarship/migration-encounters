  "text":"Ivan: Huh. That actually, I forget to mention. Besides these people and\n   Mexicans, there were gangsters in school, but I don't know, I was never\n   inclined to go that way. I never liked to dress like that. I never liked to\n   act like that. So that's probably why I never went that path and definitely\n   what my mom taught me. She always been a patient woman. She always taught\n   me to respect others. So probably that helped a lot, what my mom taught me.\n   And I will see these people dressing like that, acting like that, I was\n   never like that. So probably that's why I never went to that path.\n \n"
