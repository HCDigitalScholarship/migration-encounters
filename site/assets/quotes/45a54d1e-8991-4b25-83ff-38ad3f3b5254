  "text":"Mike: Just going through everything, it kind of made me not have feelings\n   for anybody, because when you have feelings for somebody that's a way that\n   somebody could hurt you. So it's like you block all that out and you don't\n   want nothing to do with it, because that way you can get hurt. I'm sorry,\n   I'm going off topic.\n \n \n  "
