  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n   Did you see your family again before you were deported?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yes. I came back home. I came back home, and we fought my case, and my dad\n   was actually locked up with me in county. He didn't go to prison like I\n   did. He got out pretty quickly. I don't know why even. I'm not sure why. I\n   don't know why I was the only person that was taken to prison. I don't\n   know. Maybe they were just trying to prove a point. Then my dad came back\n   to Mexico first. But I do remember meeting up with my family and then them\n   telling us that we have to do something or we're going to keep getting\n   those type of cases."
