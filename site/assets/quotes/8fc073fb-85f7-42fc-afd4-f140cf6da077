  "text":"Luis: But it was just misconceptions. This high school is better because it\n   doesn't have a lot of Mexicans\u2026 just unfunded things. So yeah, I then\n   transferred to the other one. And the ironic thing, at least for my mom, is\n   that I didn't really have any close Mexican friends. They were immigrants,\n   but they were not Mexicans. And it's not because I didn't wanted to. It's\n   because, I didn't feel that I fit in with that Mexican culture. I still\n   don't feel like I fit in with Mexican values and culture, or with American\n   beliefs. I don't really like either. So, I ended up being really good\n   friends with a lot of Asian people actually. Korean people have really\n   similar experiences\u2014Korean people, Vietnamese people, Filipinos- with\n   Mexicans. So it was like really interesting to know all of that people.\n   It's actually beautiful, like a beautiful cultural exchange. I think you\n   grow as a person. And I also had like American friends. Like one of my best\n   friends is American."
