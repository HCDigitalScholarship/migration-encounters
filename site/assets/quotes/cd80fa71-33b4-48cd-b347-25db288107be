  "text":"Brenda: As cheesy as this, all the call center jobs that are everywhere and\n people are like, \"That's the only job you can get?\" Well, yeah, but it's\n people that \u2026 It's a good pay for all you have above anyone else is\n English. There's a lot more educated people than me without jobs here in\n Mexico\u2014that\u2019s the only thing they don't have, English\u2014and I might get paid\n twice as much. And that's all the friends that I've made through the call\n centers through English, bilingual jobs. I\u2019ve been very fortunate because\n it's people that I can talk to in Spanglish with each other and that\n understand me culturally, which is another thing.\n      \n      \n"
