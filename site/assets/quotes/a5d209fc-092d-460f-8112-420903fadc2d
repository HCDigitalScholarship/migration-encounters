  "text":"I'm also curious whether living in the States and having\n   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship\n   differently than a Mexican woman would. And what are those differences?\n \n \n   Jesus: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from\n   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the\n   relationship. It's like, \"Oh, let's move in together.\" Over there, you're\n   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your\n   own apartment and be like, \"Hey, just come stay at my place.\" And then they\n   stay for a week or two. And over here it's like, \"Oh hey, come and stay at\n   my place.\" And they're like, \"No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and\n   that.\" And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting\n   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.\n \n \n  "
