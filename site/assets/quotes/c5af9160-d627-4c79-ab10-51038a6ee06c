  "text":"Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,\n   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to\n   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or\n   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more\n   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in\n   Mexico."
