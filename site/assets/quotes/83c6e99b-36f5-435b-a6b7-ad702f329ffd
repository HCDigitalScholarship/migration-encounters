  "text":"Ivan: At this time, at first I stayed with one of my uncles. And I found\n   out there were call centers so I was like, okay, let's give it a shot. So I\n   started working in a call center. The pay was not bad, but it wasn't that\n   good. So it was like, okay, I can deal with this. And at this point I was\n   like, nah, I'm not going back to the States. I lost, I had to sell my\n   photography equipment. I lost most of it. I had three cameras. I end up\n   just with one camera. And I tried to do photography here.\n \n"
