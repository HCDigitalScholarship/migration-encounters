  "text":"Yair: But right now I have a daughter. She's four years old. I used to be\n   married. I got separated a year and five months already, and I see her on\n   the weekends. No, most of the time I see her, but I used to see her every\n   day. Now with the schedule from work that I have, it doesn't really work\n   for me that much. I'm trying to find something else, for a better schedule,\n   then to spend the time with her because I really like to spend time with my\n   daughter, to just drive and go places. Last week I took her over here,\n   actually, so she can know the Monumento de la Revoluci\u00f3n. I took her over\n   here. She really liked it, and I'm planning to take her to more places,\n   really cool places.\n \n \n   Yair: But yeah, that's the story of my life. If I had a chance to go back\n   in the United States, I would. I never had any papers or any ID or anything\n   like that, and I actually, I made up my own card, so I worked over there\n   too by cleaning yards. I actually worked for a little while in the boat\n   factory with my parents. I used to get paid, I think, $450 a week.

Then I started saving for me to buy a car, or I did buy my first car.\n   I actually had two cars over there, and I sold them. I sold them when I\n   came back over here to Mexico City. I went to a school that's called UM.\n   That's a pay school, where you have to pay to study. I used all my money of\n   my car to study over there.\n \n \n   Anne: To get your degree?\n \n \n   Yair: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: Your high school degree?\n \n \n   Yair: Yeah, just to get it. Then after that I had no car, and I started\n   working again. I made another ... Well, I saved up for another ca"
