  "text":"Anne: Were you transported by ICE to the border?\n \n \n   Laura: No, I pay my own transportation because the lawyer just tell me that\n   I have to do it. I didn't question the lawyer. I know that, well if you are\n   a lawyer, you have to know about laws. It was provided by one of the\n   Mexicans. It was a program in the US that... well it was only for immigrant\n   women.\n \n \n   Laura: So, when my mom went to the program, and they tell her that they\n   have this good lawyer and all of that. Well, the lawyer recommend me to go\n   back to Mexico and do not get anything from ICE because if I do have to do\n   it, it will be worse. So, I went here by bus. So we only took the bus and\n   that's it. [Chuckle].\n \n \n   Anne: And you landed, or you came right to Mexico City?\n \n \n   Laura: Well from the bus, it was from Chicago to Nuevo Laredo. The bus got\n   into Nuevo Laredo. I have to look for the bus central to get into Mexico\n   City.\n \n \n  "
