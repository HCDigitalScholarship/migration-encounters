  "text":"Anne: So, obviously, you don't have any memories of that. But why did your\n parents decide to take you?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, they decided to take me because of hardships here. My father\n had already left to the United States. He was already working over there\n when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left\n to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my\n mother, my brother and I, and took us with him, back to Dallas, around the\n outskirts of Dallas.\n      \n      \n Ben: He was good with horses, so he was working at a horse stable, a\n very prominent horse stable, that caters to most of the people around SMU,\n or Southern Methodist University, that keep all their horses there. So,\n mainly it was to give us a better life, because things are bad around that\n little town. There's no opportunities.\n      \n      \n"
