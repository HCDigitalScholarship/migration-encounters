The only time I\n   heard about Sor Juana is when my dad was listening to a Nortena song from\n   Los Tigres del Norte which says something about narcotraficantes [drug\n   traffickers] and stuff and a mi me dicen Sor Juana a mi me dicen sorpresa.\n   [they call me Sor Juana, they call me surprise] And they take out their\n   cuernos de chivo [guns] and start shooting everybody. So that's the only\n   thing I ever heard about Sor Juana.\n \n"
