She ended up buying another car later on, a couple years later, not\n even as good of a car as the one I had. TV, she didn't even have the TV for\n a while. At one point, to me, I thought it was karma at first. I was like,\n I gave her a lot of stuff, I even gave her the apartment where I lived. I\n told her that you can live in that apartment, it's under my dad's name,\n nobody's going to charge you rent, nothing. It's a free apartment, you can\n stay there and you can have your own place now.\n      \n      \n"
