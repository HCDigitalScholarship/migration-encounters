  "text":"Ivan: I started high school. It's funny because here I finished elementary\n   school and I went one year of middle school and that's when I moved to the\n   States. And when I moved there, all my paperwork was not ready, so I have\n   to wait around 12 months for me to go to school in the States because of my\n   paperwork. By that time I, I was 14, so I cannot go to middle school\n   anymore. So you can say I skipped middle school and I went straight through\n   to high school. That's what happened to me. And what else?\n \n"
