  "text":"Yair: I remember that I started crying because I missed my family, my\n   cousins and my friends at school. I just wanted to go back, and then I\n   started getting used to it, once you're in school. School was really a big\n   difference, because here, the school here in Mexico, they don't have that,\n   what do you call it? They have the education, but not as much as over\n   there. Over there it was way easier to do it. You could wear your own\n   clothes. Here, you have to wear a uniform to go to school. I think that I\n   hated it all the time.\n \n \n  "
