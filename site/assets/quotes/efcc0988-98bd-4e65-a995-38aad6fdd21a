  "text":"Anita: And your mother, does she have your child?\n \n \n   Diana: Not really, that was ... when we got there with my son, that was\n   mainly the most hard things because my mom did say that she was going to\n   help me but then at the end she really didn't. He was two years old. So,\n   the first year before we can put him into preschool, we had a hard time\n   with the babysitting, and then we had to adapt to find jobs where he can\n   take care of him while I was working and stuff like that. When he got into\n   preschool it got a little bit easier, but we still never really had someone\n   that could take care of him and stuff like that. We didn't have enough\n   money to pay for a babysitter.\n \n \n   Anita: So some of the jobs you had had daycares?\n \n \n   Diana: No, we would have to, let's say if my husband work in the mornings,\n   I work at night. We had to find jobs like that.\n \n \n  "
