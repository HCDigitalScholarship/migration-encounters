  "text":"It was good at first, but then once you\n   go to school and you talk to other kids, you start to realize that your\n   life is not the same. That you cannot really relate to some of your peers.\n   And you cannot do certain things. I didn't realize that I was going back\n   into the United States as an illegal immigrant until I was actually a\n   junior in high school.\n \n \n  "
