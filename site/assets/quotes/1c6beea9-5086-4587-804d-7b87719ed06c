  "text":"Ruben: So I didn't like this, and what I did is I started getting this guy\n   to clean them. I would sweep the street and I would fix it, and that's what\n   I would tell them. \"You guys cry every time these get flooded, but you guys\n   never do nothing to fix it. Something like sweeps. Have that guy clean it\n   up so the water can just flow\" Now when I go back, they say they want me\n   back in that block. It's too far.\n \n \n   Just things you got to see. If you don't see it, you can't change it. A lot\n   of these people don't see it. They just, \"I'm from LA\", and it's good to be\n   like that. I was like that, but I'm a different guy. I'm already older.\n   Things change.\n \n \n  "
