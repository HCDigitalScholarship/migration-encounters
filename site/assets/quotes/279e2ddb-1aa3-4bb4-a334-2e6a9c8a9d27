There's a lot of finds that have been happening around the village.\n   Whenever I go, when I have a chance, I go up there, and just explore the\n   caves. I've been finding paintings, prehistoric paintings. There's a lot of\n   culture that I've been seeing that I like. That's one thing, that I'm\n   getting to know more of my country. Well, my family. I get to see my family\n   more often. If I stay in the US, I will never come, like, \u201cAh, it's\n   Mexico.\u201d [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
