  "text":"Yes, of course. My grandfather was originally born in Texas. He came to\n   Mexico when he was only seven years old. I didn't know I was illegal\n   because I thought that my family had moved to a different part of the\n   planet. I didn't think it was a bad thing. Of course, you see in the news,\n   you start seeing people getting deported. I didn't understand it, but I\n   somehow thought I was. I never asked my parents about it. We never really\n   spoke about it. All my friends, of course, they were American."
