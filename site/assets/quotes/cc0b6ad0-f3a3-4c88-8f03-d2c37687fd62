  "text":"Laura: Well, it was summer, so it was pretty nice and I did like it, but\n   once I went to school, I didn't know what to say. I didn't know what to do.\n   I have teachers, and I didn't know what they were saying. It was pretty\n   difficult to us because we didn't know what to say, we didn't know what\n   they were telling us. It was pretty bad because there was people, like\n   Mexican people, that instead of helping you, they were just making fun of\n   you because you didn't know English.\n \n \n  "
