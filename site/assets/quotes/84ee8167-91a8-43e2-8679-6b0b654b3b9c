  "text":"Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.\n   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and\n   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I\n   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really\n   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady\u2014a messy girl\n   from the streets, I think she was homeless\u2014she showed up at the restaurant,\n   and was like, \u201cHey, is this yours?\u201d It was my wallet. I was like, \u201cYeah.\n   Where you found it?\u201d \u201cHere. There's a lot of money in there, so take care\n   of it.\u201d I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was\n   like, \u201cHey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you\n   want.\u201d\n \n \n  "
