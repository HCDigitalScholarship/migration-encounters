So since my parents were always fighting I used to\n   be scared to go home sometimes you know? And it sucked. So I would always\n   try to focus every little bit of energy on my schoolwork, trying to be the\n   best at it, because I wanted to show everybody even if you don't got\n   nothing, there's still something. There's still something to fight for.\n \n \n  "
