  "text":"I know for me I've never wanted to go back again illegally. Why am\n I going to struggle again or get in trouble or be anxious all the time, an\n anxiety I can't describe? It affects you in so many ways and your mental\n health and your mental well-being. But I think, and I'm sure a lot of\n people feel that same way coming back here, just for the sake of at least\n mental health and overall well-being, taking a second look at a lot of\n people's stories or how it affects them leaving the only place that they've\n known for their whole life consciously. And how it affects families\n splitting apart because I know my family has been in the downfall since we\n both left years ago.\n      \n      \n Brenda: I can't imagine going back to that family, that's not a family I\n recognize quite anymore. It affects a lot of people that you might not\n assume get affected. People that are there illegally and siblings \u2026 But\n just that, how much it can affect in so many way"
