You\n   know, Mexico City, I mean it's not the worst, but I don't want my kids to\n   get involved in drug things, and stuff. And sometimes I just talk to my son\n   and I talk about the life that I got there and the things that I was doing\n   with my parents. He's like, \u201cI want to go out there, mama.\u201d I want to take\n   him there. I want to show him, I want him to learn English, and he can\n   study there. I want to go back. I think you can do that.\n \n \n  "
