  "text":"Juan: My plan was, when I was 16 I had received DACA. I was one of the\n   first ones who had received it\u2014because that's when it had barely come out.\n   I applied for it, I got it. I think I was a junior in high school. My first\n   job was as a dishwasher, and then from there\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: You got a green card so you could go to work?\n \n \n   Juan: I don't consider DACA as a green card. It's more like a permit to\n   work.\n \n \n   Anne: A permit to work.\n \n \n   Juan: Yeah, I had DACA, so my plan was to graduate high school, work for\n   one or two years, save up money, then go to college."
