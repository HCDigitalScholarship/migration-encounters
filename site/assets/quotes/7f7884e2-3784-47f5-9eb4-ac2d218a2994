I enjoyed the time I was there, and they\n   would tell me, \"Do you want to go back?\" I would probably say no, but I\n   mean it was nice.\n \n \n   Tim: Why wouldn't you want to go?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Because I feel free here. I have my family here. I might not see a\n   grass and ponds and so what, but I see my city and el Monumento de la\n   Revoluci\u00f3n , el Angel. I've been to other states like Cancun. Cancun is\n   beautiful. I would rather be in Cancun than in the States. And you also\n   make dollars in Cancun. So I mean it's nice.\n \n \n  "
