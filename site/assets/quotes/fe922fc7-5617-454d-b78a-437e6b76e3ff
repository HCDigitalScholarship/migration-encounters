  "text":"Then I went to the school, and it was really,\n   really hard for me because I couldn't say, \"May I go to the restroom?\" I\n   couldn't check anything. The first day for me was horrible. Because I\n   didn't know English. I didn't know anybody. I was a really different person\n   than the students from there. They just looked at me like, \"Who are you?\"\n   Some people would talk to me, and I was like [gestures] with signs. Then\n   they put me with a tutor. It was just pretty much, all the year, I stayed\n   with the tutor all the time, just learning English.\n \n \n  "
