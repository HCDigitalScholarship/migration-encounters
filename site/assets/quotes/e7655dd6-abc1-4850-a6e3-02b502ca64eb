  "text":"Miguel: What I remember is you know living in a two -bedroom apartment with\n   my family, which was at that time, my dad, my stepmom, my aunt and uncle,\n   my cousin, my other aunt and uncle and my two boy cousins. So it was quite\n   a few of us in a two bedroom apartment. We used to, our room was the living\n   room. I remember living in the apartment and my dad used to put both the\n   couches together and make it bigger. And my stepmom and myself would sleep\n   on the couches, and my dad would sleep on the side of us.\n \n \n  "
