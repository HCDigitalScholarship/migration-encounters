  "text":"So you just came home from school one day and he was already taken\n   away?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, he was already taken away.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Were you able to visit him in detention?\n \n \n   Laila: No, we weren't since we didn't have any sort of paper that let us go\n   in, or we weren't residents. We didn't have a visa, we didn't have\n   anything.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You had to have papers like that in order to visit a family member?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, in detention center. Or you would also be detained. So, we\n   lived for about eleven months before he got physically deported back to\n   Mexico.\n \n \n   Lizzy: That's a long time to be kind of waiting, not knowing.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. I didn't even go back to school at that point. I was in high\n   school and my high school got raided a couple of times.\n \n \n  "
