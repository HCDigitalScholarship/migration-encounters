  "text":"Mike: I had a choice where I could've been just like, \"Fuck it, I'm not\n   going to go anymore.\" But I just told them straight up and I was like, \"Can\n   you guys just give me a chance?\" And they're like, \"Yeah, dude. Just come\n   back whenever you want. You don't have to wait those six months since we\n   didn't fire you, or anything like that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So, yeah. Hopefully I'll find something. They actually told me they\n   had some openings here, but if that doesn't work out, I know I could always\n   go back to Teletech. Hopefully something's got to give.\n \n \n  "
