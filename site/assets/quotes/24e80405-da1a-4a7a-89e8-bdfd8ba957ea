  "text":"Juan: Initially when I was five years old, my dad went to the US to work.\n   He was there for three years, and then he was able to save up money to have\n   my brother and my mom cross the border and be with him. My dad, I don't\n   know why he chose Utah, but in specific, Provo. That's where I grew up.\n \n \n   Anne: Provo.\n \n \n   Juan: Yes, Provo [Chuckles]. What my dad always says is that he wanted to\n   provide us with a better future because my dad comes from outside of the\n   city, like the states in the south of Mexico. He lives in the small\n   villages where the houses are still made out of mud or their houses are\n   barely standing\u2014where the actual Mexican culture comes from. I guess we\n   could say the indigenous people. That's the kind of place that my dad was\n   coming from. He just wanted to provide us with a better future than he\n   could provide us here in Mexico. He wanted us to go with him to the US and\n   to be able to create a better future and better opportunity for us.\n \n \n  "
