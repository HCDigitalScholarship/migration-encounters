You don't need to.\u201d I go, \"Well one I'm going, I want\n to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I\n know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real\n job.\u201d Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,\n but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,\n that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in\n that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I\n can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down\n there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but\n I'm a city person [Laughs].\n      \n      \n"
