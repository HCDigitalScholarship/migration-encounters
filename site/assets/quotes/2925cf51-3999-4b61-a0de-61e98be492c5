  "text":"Anne: So, you dropped out of high school to help with your dad because he\n was sick and then you got your GED without studying.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the\n courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?\n Did you think about that?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured\n would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For\n instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of\n the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--\n definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance\n because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real\n estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor\n in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,\n but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in\n Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the\n opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that\n much capital to be able to take that much more on.\n      \n      \n"
