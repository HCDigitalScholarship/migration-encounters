  "text":"People know that obviously we get some\n decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.\n The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we\n get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking\n and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.\n It's probable cause, supposedly.\n      \n      \n Axel: And if they catch you with something, they won't take you to jail.\n They'll just ask you for a bribe and they'll take 200 or 300 pesos from\n you. If you don't have any money, they'll take your phone. If you don't\n offer them the money or say, \"I'm not going to give you any money,\" they'll\n scare you to act like they're going to take you to the jail. Then they give\n you a last chance. They're like, \"Okay, last chance before we get there,\n it's right there across the street. You want to go ahead and cooperate or\n you want us to go with the judge? Blah, blah, blah.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: They're all in cahoots, really. In the end, what they all really want\n is just some money. If you offer them money, they're going to let you go.\n It's happened to a lot of people. It's happened even to me. They catch me\n and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the\n fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we\n get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our\n attitude that we take against them.\n      \n      \n"
