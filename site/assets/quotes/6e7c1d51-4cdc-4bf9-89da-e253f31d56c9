  "text":"I came\n   back July second and I had a job in August. Pretty much everyone, the only\n   opportunities that we have here as returnees and everything, is call\n   centers. So, I started working at a call center. I had a really hard time.\n   No, not this one, Tevista. Telvista was the first call center I went to.\n \n \n   Ilse: It was just a relief being able to find a job so fast, but it's not\n   something that I loved. It was really tough, but it was a relief at the\n   same time because I was going to be able to meet people and everything.\n \n \n  "
