  "text":"Jeimmy: At the beginning? I was super happy because I was like, \"Oh yes, I\n   will see my abuelita.\" [grandmother] Because in the States, I would always\n   adopt grandmas. For example, we used to live in this black neighborhood.\n   So, there was this black lady who I always would call her \u201cAbuelita.\u201d And\n   she was like, \"mi abuelita negra.\" It was pretty cool. But after so many\n   years of not actually seeing your grandma, it's like the best.\n \n \n  "
