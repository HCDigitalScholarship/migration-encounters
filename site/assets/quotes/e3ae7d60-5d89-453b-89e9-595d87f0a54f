  "text":"Joana: I believe it didn't happen to me just because my mom did have me at\n   a young age. She had me when she was fifteen. So, I didn't want to go\n   through that. I didn't want to not have the experience of going to school\n   and having friends and going out and actually enjoying my life as a\n   teenager and just moving straight to having a kid\u2014being responsible and\n   taking care of him and working and still having to pay day care and\n   everything. I didn't want to go through that. I didn't think I was fit\n   enough, I guess. I mean, you're young. I know you learn things, and there's\n   no book that just states it there that you have to do this, and you have to\n   do that. No. You kind of have to experience things to learn from them. I\n   don't think I wanted to go through that. I believe a lot of young girls go\n   through it because sometimes, especially, I guess, Hispanics, they have to\n   work to maintain everything\u2014home, kids, everything, cars. So, pretty much,\n   they get left alone and they're not taken care of so they have a lot of\n   liberty. I think that's why.\n \n \n  "
