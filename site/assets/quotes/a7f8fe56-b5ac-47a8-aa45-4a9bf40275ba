What were they?\n \n \n   Olimpya: I wanted to go in the army.\n \n \n   Anita: In what?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Army.\n \n \n   Anita: You wanted to join the army?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah, that was my path.\n \n \n   Anita: Why?\n \n \n   Olimpya: I wanted to serve the country that has given me a lot, the best\n   thing that I lived. I just wanted to do it [Softly]. I thought it was a\n   nice way to thank for everything that happened to me while I was there, for\n   the protection because I was protected. Because I know people are scared of\n   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw\n   a police, I was like, \"Hey, thank you. You're taking care of me.\"\n   [Laughing]. And the firefighters, I was like, \"Hey, you're the best.\" Every\n   time I saw somebody dressed in the army uniform, I was like, \"Damn. I want\n   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.\" That was my\n   biggest dream.\n \n \n  "
