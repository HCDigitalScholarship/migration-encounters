  "text":"Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same\n   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of\n   people say, \"Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new\n   president...\" It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.\n   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,\n   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment\n   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come\n   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to\n   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.\n \n \n   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. \"Oh, my\n   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.\", \"Hey, I can fix it.\", stuff like\n   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside\n   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put\n   it in them. I try to tell them, \"I'm going to give you a little bit of\n   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by\n   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.\n \n \n  "
