  "text":"Melani: Yes. When I first came here, I didn't understand almost anything\n   they told me. Like I said, when I was learning English, I would just learn\n   it by ear, and right now I'm learning [Spanish] by ear, but I still\n   struggle sometimes to understand what they're trying to tell me. I tell\n   them to say it maybe three or four times to me because I really don't\n   understand.\n \n \n  "
