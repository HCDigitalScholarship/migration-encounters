  "text":"Joana: I got arrested in _____. I moved to ______when I was about\n   seventeen. I stayed about a year and that's when I.C.E. took me in.\n \n \n   Anita: For what?\n \n \n   Joana: It was, I think, an illegal turn, a U-turn. I was driving without a\n   license because we can't get a license, but yet again, we do have to get to\n   work. I mean, how are you going to expect anyone to get to work if they\n   don't have transportation? You have to drive. It's probably the main thing\n   that, why a lot of people get deported. That and raids.\n \n \n   Anita: Is this the first time you were stopped just for making an illegal\n   turn?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: That's the first thing you did?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. Well I had tickets, but I had never gotten arrested. I pretty\n   much always paid my tickets.\n \n \n   Anita: Then what happened?\n \n \n   Joana: And then, well, I went into custody. They tried to get me out, but\n   they couldn't. I.C.E. took me in. That's how I got back to Mexico.\n \n \n  "
