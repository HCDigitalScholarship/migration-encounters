  "text":"Now I don't want to be a nationality. I want to be a human. If aliens from\n   different planet come, they're going to be, \"Oh, wait, not the Mexicans\n   because they're cool. Not the Americans.\" No, they're going to say, \"Hey,\n   all of you are humans and we're going to take over.\" I hope it never\n   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be\n   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that\n   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people\n   categorize. Even in movies, they say, \"Best Mexican actor,\" or something\n   like that. Like, \"No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be\n   categorized as best Mexican or best Hispanic. They're humans. They have the\n   talent just like anybody else.\"\n \n \n  "
