  "text":"Yordani: So 911 came and they checked me, my pulse was getting slower. I\n   guess they injected something to wake me up, it wasn't working. I guess\n   they decided to take me to a hospital. They took me to the hospital and I\n   guess they didn't have the tools to help with that, to help with the\n   overdose, so they transported me to another place. And there, they had to\n   put a tube down my throat and remove the liquid, and they put me to sleep.\n \n \n   Yordani: I remember having dreams, I felt like it was a dream and I was\n   fighting to get out of this bed, like trying to fight out of this hospital\n   bed really hard. And just little moments where I had consciousness and I\n   remember little parts, and yeah, I just remember fighting really hard just\n   to get out. I felt really strong and unstoppable. And I guess one of the\n   reasons is, I guess, the Vikings before going to battle would take this\n   mushroom and they'd feel enraged and empowered. So I guess I was too then,\n   right? And yeah, so yeah, that happened.\n \n \n  "
