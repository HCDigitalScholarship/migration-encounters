  "text":"Yair: I can't really remember myself being as a kid. I can't remember how I\n   was, but growing up over there, knowing the things, the places and people\n   that you know, the education from school that you got, I think it's a lot\n   different than over here. Here in Mexico here it is nice too, but they\n   don't have really the same education that's over there. Here, people from\n   Mexico, they do whatever they want. They don't follow the rules, or I don't\n   know, I just think it's about the education difference. Yeah, I think, I\n   don\u2019t know. Yeah. I think I'm a honest people, person, I mean. I don't like\n   to really lie and stuff, or make up things. I just tell what I feel, what\n   I've been through.\n \n \n  "
