  "text":"Lizzy: Then, what about high school? What was high school like?\n      \n      \n Jesus: It was interesting. It was really fun. [Laughs]. I had a bunch of\n friends. I had all kinds of friends. I had the rocker friends, the emo\n friends, the gang bangers, everybody like that.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Were there a lot of gangs at your school or in your neighborhood?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I think my school mostly. My neighborhood, I didn't really see it\n because it was suburbs\u2014it was sort of the suburbs. It was like, this side\n is all calm, and then from the other side, passing Lennox and stuff, that's\n where all the gangs were at. I got saved from that.\n      \n      \n"
