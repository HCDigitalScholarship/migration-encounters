  "text":"Laura: Well I was almost finished; it was like two mouths to finish. But I\n   didn't finish it because I'd see the problems with my dad and my mom, and I\n   start to go out with my friends, and I was involved in a car accident. I\n   wasn't driving, but I wasn't all up there, and I got deported.\n \n \n   Anne: Obviously you didn't have papers, but had you been drinking? Was\n   there something that?\n \n \n   Laura: We were drinking. I wasn't driving, but I was in the car, so they\n   found alcohol.\n \n \n   Laura: Alcohol on the vehicle and it's like at the border.\n \n \n   Anne: Hardly anything to be deported for, right?\n \n \n   Laura: I know. I tried to stay there, but it was better for me to get\n   deported than stay. I didn't want to be in jail. They tried to put me in\n   jail for two months.\n \n \n  "
