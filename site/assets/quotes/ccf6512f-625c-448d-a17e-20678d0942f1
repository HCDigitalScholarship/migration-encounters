  "text":"Yair: Yeah, I was really, really careful because I was like, man, what if I\n   get stopped or pulled over, if I get a ticket? Maybe I'll pay the ticket,\n   but you never know what type of police cop you'll get. I did have a lot of\n   racist people from over there, but I didn't really pay attention to them.\n   Most of the time I did got in a fight with them, and after that they didn't\n   bother me no more. I know what people are good to you, and what, some\n   people that are not good to you. I never took it really personal, but there\n   was actually one. There was this actually one time that ... I think I was\n   nine? No, 12, 11 years old. I was on the bus. The bus takes you home. There\n   was this one big kid, I remember. He was making fun of, and making jokes\n   about, African people. He was bothering this guy, and I got mad. I stood\n   up, and I was like, \"What have you got to say?\"\n \n \n  "
