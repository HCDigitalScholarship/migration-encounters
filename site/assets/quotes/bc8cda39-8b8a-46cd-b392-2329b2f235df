  "text":"Yair: Yeah, like rodeos and things like that. I really liked most of the\n   time going to the rodeos, and seeing people ride the bulls and the horses\n   and stuff. It was really nice. But there was not any gangs. I used to go to\n   the city in Little Rock, which is the city in Arkansas. I used to go there\n   just to go clubbing, parties and stuff, but I never wanted to be part of\n   the gang. I did have some friends that offered me to be part of the gang,\n   and sell weed and stuff. I was like, \"No, I'm not going to do this, man.\"\n   I'm like, \"No.\"\n \n \n  "
