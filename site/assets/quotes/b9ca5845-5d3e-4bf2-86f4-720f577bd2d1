  "text":"Ruben: But I mean they treat us good. It was just little things that you\n   know, kids don't like, but my mom, she had a daughter, her name was\n   Gabriela, she was about nine months, but when she was born, she couldn't\n   breathe that good. And one of the female doctors left her in the night with\n   a baby bottle in her mouth. So she basically choked on the milk. She died.\n   She passed away in the hospital and my mom went crazy and she scratched the\n   doctor's face. So she figured that they were going to look for her. And my\n   dad left, went and saved money, then they came back and picked us up.\n \n \n  "
