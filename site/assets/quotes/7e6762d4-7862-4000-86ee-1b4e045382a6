  "text":"Axel: You could tell me it's all calm, but everybody says my area is a\n little area, it's kind of a dangerous area, but I've never been in any type\n of situations over there. No assaults. How do they call it? People that get\n on the public transport and they steal from the public transports,\n hijackings and whatever. Something like that. Never anything like that, and\n everybody said that that area is mainly known for that type of stuff. But\n at the same time, I guess it's the people. Once they see you where you live\n and they start getting to know you, and they don't really mess with you.\n They're like, \"Oh yeah, that's the guy, he lives over there somewhere. I\n see him every day or I see him every two days, but I seen him a couple\n times.\"\n      \n      \n"
