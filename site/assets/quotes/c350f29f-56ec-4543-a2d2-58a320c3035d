  "text":"Juan: Okay, my family. In 1997, I got married to my wife and we had three\n   children. I have one boy and two girls. And they are still living in the\n   United States because my children are still going to school and now they\n   are pursuing their dreams. And I didn't want to force them to come with me\n   because I didn't know how it was going to be here in Mexico. So they stayed\n   back there and we talk over the phone. We text and video calls and things\n   like that, but they're still living over there and I miss them very much.\n \n \n  "
