  "text":"My favorite holiday? I'm not sure. I'm not sure. I think, well, maybe every\n   child's favorite holiday is Christmas because of the presents. I didn't\n   really care about the presents. I cared more about everybody being there.\n   Sometimes the whole family didn't see each other until the end of the year.\n   I think that was the time where I really got to see all of my cousins or I\n   really got to see my uncles. But a favorite holiday? I don't know, April\n   Fool's maybe? [laughing] I could do a lot of pranks on people. I'm not\n   sure. I don't think I had a favorite holiday.\n \n \n  "
