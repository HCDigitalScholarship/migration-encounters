  "text":"My earliest memories in the US would be probably me seeing\n sunlight, because I remember we were in a trunk at one point. And my family\n tells the story as a joke, I guess it. But it seems that they forgot us in\n the trunk for a little while. So yeah, that would be my earliest memories\n of you know, me being in the United States, getting out of the trunk and\n going to Walmart, trying to buy clothes, and just seeing everything brand\n new, everything was completely different. Honestly, that's the only thing\n that I can remember because I really don't have much memories of me being\n young not even here in Mexico. I can't remember.\n      \n      \n"
