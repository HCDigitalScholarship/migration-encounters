  "text":"Axel: I'm like, I\u2019m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the\n people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really\n disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called\n my parents and my friends were like, \"Hey, are you out already? Where are\n you so we can go pick you up?\" I'm like, \"I'm inside my cell.\" And they're\n like, \"What, why?\" I was like, \"Apparently, immigration put a hold on me\n this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,\n they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then\n once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why\n are you here still?\" And they were like, \"Oh well, it's because you have an\n immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back\n in.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,\n three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were\n trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,\n when my judge got the deal where they were like, \"Okay, this is what we're\n going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and\n you're only going to do two years.\"\n      \n      \n"
