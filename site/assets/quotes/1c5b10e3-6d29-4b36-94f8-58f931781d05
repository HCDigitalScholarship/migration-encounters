  "text":"Axel: And then I don't know the whole story of how my mom and my stepdad\n started talking, but I know they were coworkers because they've told me\n that part before, and my dad's also told me. He's like, \"Yeah, I know him.\n We used to work together, he was just my partner, in a way.\" I mean, my dad\n doesn't seem like he has any hard feelings about it, but he never remarried\n again, so I don't know what happened there. But my mom got remarried and\n now it's been like, I don't know, I suppose right now it's been about\n almost 20 years? And he's never remarried, he's never really bothered, I\u2019ve\n never met him to have a girlfriend, no other kids, nothing. After the first\n one, he just gave up and just enjoys his house alone with the dogs and\n stuff.\n      \n      \n"
