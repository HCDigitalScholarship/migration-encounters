  "text":"Noe: The biggest challenge I would say is to adapt and to accept people the\n   way they are because obviously they're not in the US. It's hard for me to\n   accept, to ignore them, to see if someone has stolen something, is not\n   doing things right. It's hard to me to keep quiet. So, to adapt and to\n   accept these people. That's really hard. Sometimes I just feel like I want\n   to scream at people and yell at them. Just, \u201cGet a job, just do something\n   for your life.\u201d It's like, \u201cDo a job. Everybody's getting a job. Why are\n   you jacking off? Why are you just jacking people on the streets or trying\n   to defraud and make fraud everywhere? Just get a job or something.\u201d That\n   makes me mad, because I have a job. I'm paying taxes.\n \n \n  "
