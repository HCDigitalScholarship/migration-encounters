  "text":"Zayuri: Okay. I was around 12 years old when we got there. I remember that\n   I was excited because my dad told us that we were going to be better there,\n   that we were going to have more stability and things like that, you know,\n   the usual stuff that they tell you. I got here almost three years ago when\n   I was around 17, 18. It was really hard because I didn't understand what\n   was happening, not fully. I knew that it was because it was better for the\n   family, but I did get very angry at the beginning, but\u2014\n \n \n   Isabel: When you went to the US or when you came back?\n \n \n   Zayuri: When I came back, I was really angry because I was like 17. So, it\n   was a couple of good years, like five years.\n \n \n  "
