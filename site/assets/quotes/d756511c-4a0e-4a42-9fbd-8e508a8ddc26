  "text":"Lizzy: So it's a very different kind of fear than what you had in the\n   States? Something about how in the States you had to be in fear of the\n   police or ICE.\n \n \n   Laila: [Affirmative sound]\n \n \n   Lizzy: And now here, it's fear of violence. Which one is worse?\n \n \n   Laila: I would say, the fear that I have here because probably with ICE,\n   you know that you're going to be detained and deported. Here, you don't\n   know if you're going to go back home. You don't know if you're even going\n   to make it back home. In the news, constantly, there are women being found\n   dead, beaten, shot. Even when you go into the public transportation,\n   constant fear of having someone get in and shoot a gun. It's constant where\n   I live. Public transportation is probably the worst thing you could go on\n   because it's constant. The people getting on there to rob other people\u2014they\n   just shoot without even thinking twice. They shoot you and they don't care.\n \n \n   Laila: So, it's probably a lot scarier here [Chuckles] than in the States.\n   In the States, you know you may get detained, you may get deported and\n   that's that. But here you're just scared for your life, completely.\n \n \n  "
