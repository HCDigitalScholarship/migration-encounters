  "text":"lly: I miss speaking English with people. Because when I'm speaking\n Spanish a lot of times, I'm trying to express a certain idea, but I don't\n know how to use certain words. So let's say that I'm telling this guy, \"Oh\n dude, that was a great experience.\" I don't know how to say 'experience' in\n Spanish. It's like, \u201cOh esa fue una experiencia muy buena\u201d It's just things\n like that. And so yeah, just being able to speak very quickly in English\n and express myself better. That's what I miss. Here I have to tell them in\n Spanish \u201coh est\u00e1 aqu\u00ed por la carretera y me fue algo muy excelente\u201d and I\n have to think when I'm speaking. And so, there's pauses and stuff. That\n never happened to me before.\n      \n      \n A"
