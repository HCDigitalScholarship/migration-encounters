Where did you bought it?\" She was like, \"In Ireland,\" or something\n   like that. I said, \"Oh, are you from Ireland?\" She was like, \"No, I'm from\n   Germany.\" I was like, \"This is my time to shine! Where are my five lessons\n   from Duolingo? This is what I've worked for. Say something nice.\" I was\n   like, \"Okay, I know how to say your skirt is nice in German.\" I was like,\n   \"Okay.\" I was like, \"Yeah, I'm going to say it. I'm going to say it.\" By\n   the time I got the courage, she got off the bus.\n \n \n  "
