Was it-\n \n \n   Roberto: Like at what age, or?\n \n \n   Sergio: What age.\n \n \n   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,\n   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about\n   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were\n   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't\n   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.\n \n \n   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what\n   did you think?\n \n \n   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of\n   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,\n   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the\n   flag, and sing the... It's called-\n \n \n   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.\n \n \n   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]\n \n \n   Sergio: Do you remember how it goes?\n \n \n   Roberto: No, I just remember that part, \"Pledge Allegiance to the flag of\n   the United States of America.\" And that's that. When I was in elementary,\n   yeah, lo sab\u00eda todo. I used to know it all.\n \n \n   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought\n   you were different, right?\n \n \n   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you\n   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that\n   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.\n \n \n   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going\n   through your mind?\n \n \n   Roberto: Oh like, \"Damn. For real?\" I was like, I don't know, yeah, I\n   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a\n   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was\n   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when\n   I came here to Mexico, yeah.\n \n \n  "
