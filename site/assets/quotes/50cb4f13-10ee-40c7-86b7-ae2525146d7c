  "text":"Sergio: What was your experience when you got back to Mexico?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: My experience when I first arrived in Mexico, when I first got\n   back in Mexico was surreal, it was a blur. I'm terribly afraid of heights.\n   That's my fear. Not so much anymore but yeah, heights are not my thing. I\n   remember being on the plane and it taking a turn, and I remember seeing all\n   the buildings and I saw everything and I even scooted up in front of my\n   seat to see and it's like I completely forgot that I was afraid of heights.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And I felt happy and I don't know why. I don't know if it was\n   because I was finally going to be free. And before it turned, before they\n   told all the people, all the agents or the officials to sit down, they took\n   the handcuffs off and they took the shackles off and I just, I'm like,\n   \u201cWhoa, okay, this shit is real. This is real.\u201d And it did that turn and we\n   finally got down and I saw the... we were passing by all hangars, the\n   military hangar, the presidential hangar, certain company's hangars and\n   whatever.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Got off the plane, and I just remember looking back and looking at\n   my hands and not seeing handcuffs or a police officer right next to me and\n   I felt happy. But then I got on the phone and I called my mom and she was\n   just happy that I was out and everything. She started crying and I then\n   started crying too but then... that was just very mixed emotions. And the\n   first couple of months, they were all right until I started figuring out\n   that the individuals who are my family, as a matter of fact, who are\n   supposed to help me out here were just after the money.\n \n \n  "
