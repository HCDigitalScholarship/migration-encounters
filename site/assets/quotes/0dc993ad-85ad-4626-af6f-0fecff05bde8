  "text":"Ruben: I did, but then still sometimes you'd run into people that they\n   already know you, that you didn't know they knew you. They were still\n   looking for you for things you did when you were like 14 or 15 so that's\n   when you react and say, \"Hey, wait a minute, I'm a gang member too.\" I\n   don't forget. But if anybody, nobody is still looking for trouble or\n   anything like that, you are actually able to control that. You are actually\n   able to do something right instead of just thinking, \"Well I'll just shoot\n   them and it will end.\" No. We're humans. We just talk it out.\n \n \n  "
