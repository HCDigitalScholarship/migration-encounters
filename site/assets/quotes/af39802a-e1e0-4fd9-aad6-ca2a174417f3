  "text":"Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave\n   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,\n   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone\n   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who\n   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad\n   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,\n   \"Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.\u201d\n   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I\n   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The\n   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on\n   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.\n \n \n   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with\n   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this\n   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.\n \n \n  "
