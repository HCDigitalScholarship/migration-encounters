  "text":"Carlos: It was hard because I felt sad at the moment not being with my dad\n   and my brothers. Another part, I felt kind good because I had my uncles and\n   my grandpas. One of my uncles that lived here is one of the ones that I\n   loved the most, apart from my dad. That was kinda a relief. You put\n   something bad and put another good thing on top of that, it just kind of\n   mixes, and at the end, I'm here. That's what I think, right?\n \n \n  "
