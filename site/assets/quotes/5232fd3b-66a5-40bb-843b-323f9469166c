  "text":"Axel: And I was like, \"Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least\n you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,\n anything like that.\" \"No, no. Those options aren't available for you.\" He's\n like, \"The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your\n court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.\" Even my lawyer told\n me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in\n juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new\n again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,\n new everything was a little bit different in two years.\n      \n      \n"
