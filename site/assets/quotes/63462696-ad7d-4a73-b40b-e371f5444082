  "text":"She was trying to make money so when she could come back, we would have\n   something. She did do it because now she has a car. I guess that was it.\n   But as my mom and dad got separated, they eventually divorced. It was hard\n   on both of us, my sister and I. I did feel guilty because I thought that\n   because of me being deported caused my mom to send my sister and it caused\n   my parents to separate. I did feel bad about that. It was horrible because\n   I felt like I was a bad person. I felt like it was my fault that my parents\n   got divorced. I felt really bad.\n \n \n  "
