  "text":"Laura: He did. He did graduate from high school. He got DACA, but he didn't\n   use the DACA. Like he only work at factories because the social security\n   number was the legal one, however, he didn't want to study.\n \n \n   Anne: So, when you were at the University of Chicago, did you learn about\n   DACA?\n \n \n   Laura: When I was in the University, I was approximately 17 years old, kind\n   of. Like 17 or 18. I didn't learn about DACA until I was voluntary\n   deported. So when I get into Mexico, one day later, they approve DACA.\n \n \n   Anne: And when was that? What year?\n \n \n   Laura: 2011, 2010? I don't remember quite well.\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah, 2011 maybe.\n \n \n   Laura: 2011 or something.\n \n \n   Anne: It started in 2012.\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, and I was really upset because it was one day later. Like,\n   come on. [Chuckles]. I was waiting like my whole life to be legal. When\n   they basically give all the people that went into the US as children the\n   DACA, I was pretty upset. Like, what? I was in depression. Totally\n   depression, yeah.\n \n \n  "
