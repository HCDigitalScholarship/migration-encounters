  "text":"Anne: She got remarried to your stepdad?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. My stepdad. She got with a guy before that and had a kid and\n   then she got married to my stepdad. My stepdad was the one that actually\n   kind of changed our lives, because we didn't have anything and he came into\n   our lives and he got a better job. He started wanting to do better for the\n   family that he just basically adopted, and\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: None of the children were his?\n \n \n   Mike: None of them, they still don't have kids. So I look up to that man a\n   lot, because he's done a lot of sacrifices. At the same time, we're like\n   the push he needed. So we both helped each other out.\n \n \n   Anne: They're still in Arizona?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah, he's actually married to my mom. They got a house. I don't know\n   how they do it, but they're blessed. Good people, do good things, I feel\n   like you get blessed. Yeah, good karma just come back.\n \n \n  "
