  "text":"Not until later. I switched schools and then I was bullied\n   at my other school. In this school, I think the school that I went into at\n   first was extremely about academia. If you said the word \u201cshoot,\u201d it was a\n   very, very bad word. I had never heard a bad word in my life [Chuckles].\n   When I moved schools, the new school that I got to was a lot higher. It was\n   in a different area. We moved. My grandparents bought a house someplace\n   else. It was a cheap house, but not in a good neighborhood, so the school\n   that I had to go to was not a good school.\n \n \n  "
