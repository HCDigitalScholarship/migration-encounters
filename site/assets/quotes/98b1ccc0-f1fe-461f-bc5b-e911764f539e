  "text":"Luis: Yeah. And I was super open about my story. I was like, yeah, we just\n   crossed. I come from Mexico, but I wasn't really aware of the fact that I was\n   \"illegal\". This is just how it happened.\n \n \n   Anne: So how did it dawn on you?\n \n \n   Luis: When I asked if I could be part of a scholarship program\n   or something like that, I don't remember exactly what it was. It was\n   something about art because I was\u2014and I'm still\u2014really into art. But I\n   asked and I remember that some of the requirements were, I don't know. Also\n   when I was working, because they asked me for a social security number and\n   stuff like that and I didn't had any or any official IDs. We went to some\n   dude to take a picture of me and make me an ID. But at the moment I was\n   oblivious of the fact that it was an illegal ID, it was a fake ID. But then\n   like after that moment when I wanted to apply to this specific scholarship,\n   I was like wait a minute. I'm illegal in this country, I cannot apply to\n   this thing! And yeah, from that point on it was like, I need to be careful,\n   I don't want to get deported. But actually, California is like a really, or\n   at least where I was, is like a really chill state. Not in terms of like\n   people treating you well, but they don't ask. So I mean that's good enough\n   I guess.\n \n \n  "
