  "text":"Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom\n   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, \"It's your\n   time, not mine. You can leave.\" [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she\n   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my\n   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking\n   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, \"We're leaving.\"\n \n \n  "
