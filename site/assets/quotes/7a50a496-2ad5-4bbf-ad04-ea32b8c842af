  "text":"Ruben: Here too, there was a lot of leaves and stuff, but I would do that\n   because why, all those leaves they actually go down the drain. So when it\n   rains that whole street will get flooded. I used to pay this guy that\n   walked around asking for people that wanted the drain to be cleaned. I paid\n   him 180 pesos and he would clean both of them, so we can have water flowing\n   if it rains. If we wouldn't clean it and it would start raining, all that\n   would come back up inside of your house, because the drains are actually\n   connected to your house so if anything comes back, your patio will get\n   flooded.\n \n \n  "
