  "text":"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, it's really hard to pull back on those memories. From\n the ones that you're more sure of like going into school, any friends or\n teachers that stood out?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I remember going to school, it was very scary for me because I\n didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The\n teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream\u2014I didn't know\n what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody\n what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and\n that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,\n to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but\n maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really\n introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,\n you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically\n like I had to learn everything by myself.\n      \n      \n"
