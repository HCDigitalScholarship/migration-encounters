I was not just like using rude words like, \u201cHey, you\n   have to say like this, not say like that,\u201d or something like that, trying\n   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,\n   \u201cIf you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm\n   here for you guys to help you out.\u201d They didn't take it like that.\n \n \n  "
