  "text":"Sergio: Were you ever worried about getting caught by US authorities?\n \n \n   Josue: A little bit. But the stories that I heard, they didn't really feel\n   like they were hitting too close to home until I started hearing about the\n   warehouse for the newspaper. They did a raid over there. And that's the\n   first summer I was like, \u201cI don't know.\u201d But we kept on going and I didn't\n   experience a raid like that.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, the warehouse got raided?\n \n \n   Josue: Yeah.\n \n \n   Sergio: And you weren't working there anymore?\n \n \n   Josue: No. The thing is that we all worked there: me, my mom, my brother.\n   Me, at one point, I was working with my mom on one route and my dad was\n   doing another one. At some point, we all had one, and it had to be at the\n   point when only my dad was working there \u2018cause I remember he was the one\n   to tell me about that. And so, I know that for some time, he would be the\n   one to go and bring the newspapers to us. And you know, just take them up.\n \n \n  "
