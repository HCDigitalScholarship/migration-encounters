  "text":"Rocio: Yes. Yes. My daughter speaks English because I teach her at the\n   beginning. And at school, she started speaking English. My son never want\n   to speak Spanish. Since I start talking to him in Spanish and he never\n   wanted it. So when I bring him, after a year that I came here, I took him,\n   I tried to keep him with me, but it was hard because I get a job. So very\n   early in the morning, I take him with my aunt and I pick him up at night in\n   pajamas already. So it was crazy for me.\n \n \n  "
