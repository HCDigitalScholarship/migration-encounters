So it's just everything is\u2014I tried to\n   kill myself two years ago when I broke my back and they told me I need to\n   be in bed for a year because I can't have surgery. So it was like, I can't\n   do this anymore. You know, it's just, I can't, but it wasn't my time. I\n   hurt myself in every way you can imagine. And at night, it was time. I\n   didn't do it. I can't do it. So I started going to the psychiatrist again,\n   and everything is money, so it's just, I don't know when this is going to\n   end you know?\n \n \n  "
