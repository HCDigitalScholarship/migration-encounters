  "text":"I have been through so much in life. I just look\n   at it as just whatever's going to happen is going to happen now. You can\n   plan something for now, but shit changes. Sometimes things go from good to\n   bad. Some things bad from good. You can't really tell life. It's destiny. I\n   just made it to my mind where we're going to take it day by day. Whatever\n   happens, happens. If I make it back, I would be so excited. If I don't, I\n   don't. But at the end of the day, I look at it like either way, if I'm\n   going to be here... I got deported 10 years. I've been here two. So, if I'm\n   going to be here for 10 years, trying to be good and try to go back, I at\n   least got to have some type of a life. I'm going to date somebody if I'm\n   going to have more kids or whatever. But at the end of the day, I have that\n   right to live my life. So, I just live it day by day.\n \n \n  "
