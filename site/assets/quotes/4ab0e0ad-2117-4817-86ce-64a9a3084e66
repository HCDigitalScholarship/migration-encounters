  "text":"Laura: It was pretty nice. I liked it because I have a teacher that was\n   trying to teach me English\u2014well she teach me English because I learned a\n   little bit more with her and she really helped me out with my homework,\n   with my test. She helped me out a lot. We have problems there, well my dad\n   and my mom had problems. They were trying to get a divorce, so I was pretty\n   lost at that time as well\u2014I mean I didn't know what to do because I'm the\n   older sister and didn't know what to say to my sister. It was pretty\n   difficult for me to see my parents fighting and see my mom left us\u2014she was\n   coming back and she left us like three or four years. So I was in charge of\n   my little sister.\n \n \n  "
