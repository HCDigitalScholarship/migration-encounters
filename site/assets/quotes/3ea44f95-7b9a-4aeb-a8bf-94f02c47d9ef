  "text":"Yosell: From what I do remember, I used to live in Vegas with an aunt\n   there. I was doing my elementary school and then after that I moved out to\n   Utah and started doing a little bit of my middle school and after that I\n   was kind of moving around a lot of places, I guess just working\u2014my dad got\n   me a job working for construction. And I was doing my high school online, a\n   kind of homeschool thing. That was pretty interesting. I would come back to\n   Mexico quite often. I would kind of just jump the border and come see my\n   mom, and then I jumped it again.\n \n \n  "
