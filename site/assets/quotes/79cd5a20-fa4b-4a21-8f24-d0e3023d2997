  "text":"Isabel: That's awesome. Well, I hope you pursue that dream. Just some\n general questions that we like to touch on, you can take them whichever\n direction you want. Do you consider yourself more Mexican or American or do\n you consider yourself Mexican or American?\n      \n      \n Angelo: American.\n      \n      \n Isabel: American, 100%?\n      \n      \n Angelo: 100% American.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Why do you think that is?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking\n around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].\n So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I\n talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I\n guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it\n and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and\n down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't\n belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and\n I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much\n all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all\n that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal\n ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn\u2019t 100% in\n America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was\n some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.\n      \n      \n"
