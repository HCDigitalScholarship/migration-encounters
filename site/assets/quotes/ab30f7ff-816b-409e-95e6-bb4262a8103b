But there was not any gangs. I used to go to\n   the city in Little Rock, which is the city in Arkansas. I used to go there\n   just to go clubbing, parties and stuff, but I never wanted to be part of\n   the gang. I did have some friends that offered me to be part of the gang,\n   and sell weed and stuff. I was like, \"No, I'm not going to do this, man.\"\n   I'm like, \"No.\"\n \n \n  "
