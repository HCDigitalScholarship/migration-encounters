What part of LA?\n      \n      \n Jesus: By LAX, actually.\n      \n      \n Jesus: It was super close. I could skate to the beach.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: I love that part of LA.\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, it's really nice. Super beautiful, everything, the beaches.

With my friends, they knew how to skate, and I was like,\n \u201cWhoa, that looks cool.\u201d [Chuckles]. I want to do it.\u201d So, I started\n skating. It's a good form of transportation too, can get anywhere with it.\n [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n"
