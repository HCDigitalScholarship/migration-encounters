  "text":"Anita: Does your son consider himself Mexican at all?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes. He could be one Mexican, and he's completely the Mexican\n   flag. He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,\n   \"Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.\" He will be\n   like, \"Mexico, Mexico.\" This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the\n   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,\n   \"A quien le vas?\" [who are you rooting for?] He will go, \"Mexico.\" That's\n   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we\n   would tell him, \"But you're not Mexican. You have to go for the United\n   States.\" He's like, \"No. I go for Mexico.\""
