  "text":"Olimpya: I lost my kidneys and so I was sick. I've just been trying to\n   survive. I don't know if I learned or I just decided not to do more than I\n   have to, to survive because whenever you try to do the best you can, people\n   don't think the same way as you. My baby's dad don't think the same way as\n   me. I don't know if he doesn't want the family that I want or worse. We\n   don't have the same culture. When I started working, he used to get really\n   mad. He used to get really jealous. He would be like, \"Hey, no. Don't talk\n   to this person. Don't talk to this person. No, you can't do that.\" Then I\n   got ascended, ascent? Promotion.\n \n \n  "
