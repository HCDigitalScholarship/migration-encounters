And then they started pushing up\n   everybody all the way from the front and they pushed my mom. And then at\n   that moment, I was telling the guy, \u201cWhat's wrong with you?\u201d and stuff like\n   that. And then he was with his friends. He was an African American, so then\n   I called them nigger and stuff like that. And then I start fighting with\n   them, my mom got all scared, start pushing me, and then from there then the\n   guy punched me in the face. And then my mom got really scared about that\n   and she was like, \u201cNo, I'm not going to deal with this, I want to send you\n   out.\u201d\n \n \n   Anita: So when you say fighting, fighting, like punching or fighting with\n   knives or what?\n \n \n   Diana: No, it was just fighting, like punching, getting into fights.\n \n \n   Anita: So she sends you back to Mexico?\n \n \n   Diana: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n \n \n  "
