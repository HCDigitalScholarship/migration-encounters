  "text":"It was good for that part but at the same time I did feel discrimination by\n   my own people because they were saying, \"Hey, you're American. What are you\n   doing here?\" Like, \"Well, I'm Mexican. I was born here,\" because my Spanish\n   wasn't good. Even still today it's not the best. They're like, \"You need to\n   learn how to speak Spanish.\" I said, \"I do speak Spanish, just not as\n   well.\" It's like, \"You need to learn how to speak English.\" My defense has\n   always been like that, \"Yeah, okay, you too.\"\n \n \n  "
