You could get raped\n   by all of them. Nobody wants to go through that, or nobody wants to get\n   beat up to join a gang. Why even go through the struggle? I don't find it\n   logical to be honest. I mean, I don't want to go through suffering to be in\n   a gang to make other people suffer. I really don't get it. I mean, you\n   could work to get money. Why do you have to rob someone? Why do you have to\n   beat someone up? Why do you have to stab them and shoot them?\n \n \n  "
