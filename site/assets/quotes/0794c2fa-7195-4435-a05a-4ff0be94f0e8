  "text":"Donovan: And the immigration center, they give you good food. My mom used\n   to always put money for commissary. They told me that I had a chance to\n   stay there and fight to become a US citizen. A year into me being there, I\n   met a guy who had less crimes than I had, and he already said seven years\n   there. I was like, \u201cNo, it's not going to do. I'm going to waste 10 years\n   of my life. My mom's not going to see me, not even my friends from my\n   school will see me.\u201d The public defender I had, was like, \u201cNo,\u201d she didn't\n   want it. I was like, \u201cYou know what? I want to dip. I want to go. I don't\n   care.\u201d And she started telling me\u2014it was a Mexican girl\u2014things are fucked\n   up. I was like, \u201cI want to go. I can\u2019t give a fuck. I want to leave right\n   now.\u201d And she was still fighting for me. I remember that time I stood up\n   and I was like, \u201cYou know what, I no longer want her to represent me.\u201d And\n   the judge was like, \u201cNo, no. He doesn't know.\u201d I was like, \u201cI no longer\n   want her to represent me. I'm over age. I can represent myself.\u201d And the\n   judge, I still remember, was like, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I was like, \u201cI want\n   you to deport me tonight. I want to be in Mexico right now.\u201d It was a year\n   and eight months. I was going nuts. I don't know. I was 180 pounds. I was a\n   butterball, so I just wanted to leave. I found out about that guy's case\n   and I was like, \u201cYou know what? I'm not going to waste seven years of my\n   life here. I'd rather be somewhere over there.\u201d\n \n \n  "
