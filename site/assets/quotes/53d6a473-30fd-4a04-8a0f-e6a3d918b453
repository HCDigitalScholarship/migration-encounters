  "text":"Anita: Was the tumor benign?\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, it was benign. Thank God for that. But she had an encounter\n   with TB and then she was on medication for that. You know what I think it\n   was? I think that all this negativity affected her [Chuckles], or I don't\n   know if you believe this, but the law of attraction. I think that she\n   really did not want to keep going and that affected her quite a bit.\n \n \n  "
