I am not an American.\" She was put\n   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in\n   there and that was very \u2026 that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm\n   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody\n   ever knew.\n \n \n  "
