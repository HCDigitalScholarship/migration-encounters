  "text":"Axel: Yeah, I had recommendation cards from the church where I used to go,\n church friends, some school teachers. I had a recommendation from a lot of\n places but my family members were never there. And that's why now that\n they're all worried about what I'm doing over here, I'm like, come on now.\n If I was over there and things went bad over there, where my mom was\n actually at and where she was able to actually get to know me and punish me\n in some way, and nothing helped over there, what makes you think that if\n I'm doing whatever you think I'm doing over here, you telling my mom is\n going to do anything? If it didn't work over there when I was there\n physically, it's not going to work over the phone. Come on now.\n      \n      \n"
