It's happened even to me. They catch me\n and they tell me... They don't find nothing on me, but they don't like the\n fact that we act the way we act. We tell them we don't have anything and we\n get mad because they're searching us for no reason. They don't like our\n attitude that we take against them.\n      \n      \n"
