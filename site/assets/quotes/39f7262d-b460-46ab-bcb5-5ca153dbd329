And they did have to go through that stuff too, in a way,\n   because sometimes I couldn't do it, because I'd be in school doing\n   something really, really important. My mom would be like, \"No, just stay in\n   school. Do this. Do that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So it's like she would take my other little brothers. But somebody\n   always had to watch my little sisters. Yeah, it was just we took turns and\n   stuff, but I feel like everybody felt it. Everybody got a chance to go\n   through that stuff even if they didn't want to [Chuckle].\n \n \n  "
