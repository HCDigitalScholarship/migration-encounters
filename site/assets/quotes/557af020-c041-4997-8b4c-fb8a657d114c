  "text":"Mike: Exactly. Exactly that's what I'm saying. There was a couple of\n   schools that they did see that we were going through financial\n   difficulties, so they signed me up. I remember my teacher, Ms. Garcia\u2014I'll\n   never forget her, she's an angel. She signed us up for this program where\n   you could go ride along with the cop and you would go to a store, you had\n   $200 and you could buy whatever you want.\n \n \n   Mike: And I remember I bought my whole family stuff, and I had the whole\n   cops crying. The whole department was crying because of all the kids, I was\n   the only one that got something for their family. The cops looked at that\n   and they're like, \"Wow, you're so young, but yet still you're family\n   orientated.\"\n \n \n  "
