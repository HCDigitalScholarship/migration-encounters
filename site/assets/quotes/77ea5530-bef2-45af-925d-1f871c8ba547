  "text":"Well, English would definitely be a skill that I would say the US gave\n me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued\n asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it\n has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and\n nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's\n pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the\n bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I\n remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I\n didn't like it. So I was like, \"I'm not doing this.\" And without any\n experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always\n tell you, \"we are hiring people,\" but it's only people with experience. So\n all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went\n to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was\n horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were\n over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the\n supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't\n even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a\n big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who\n found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take\n me to one, and that's how I got my first job.\n      \n      \n"
