  "text":"Yeah. Yeah, and I didn't use it then, but I should have. But I did feel a\n   cultural shock especially because, in Mexico City there's all kinds of\n   people, all kinds of people. Of course, when I was in United States, I\n   would hang out with people that listened to hip hop. That was it. I didn't\n   really meet people that listened to metal music or reggae or things like\n   that. I started going out with my cousin, he's a guitar player, so he\n   started inviting me to his events. I would see different kinds of people.\n   People with long hair, makeup on, all black. I thought it was pretty cool,\n   like, \"Okay, they have their own identity.\" Then I would go into the reggae\n   events and saw people with dreadlocks, different type of black style,\n   including people that worship other\u2013 Not just Christianity but people that\n   practice Buddhism or practice Satanism or things like that. I said, \"Wow.\n   It's amazing.\"\n \n \n  "
