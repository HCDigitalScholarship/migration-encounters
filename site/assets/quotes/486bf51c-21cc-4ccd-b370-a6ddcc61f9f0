  "text":"Abel: Yeah. I started working as a kid to dress the way I wanted to dress\nbecause my mom would tell me, \"No, you can't wear those pants. They're too\nbig.\" Or, \"You can't wear that shirt.\" Or, \"No, you can't cut your hair\nlike that.\" So for me to get what I wanted to wear, I started working at\nthe swap meet. I used to work with these Chinese dudes selling shoes. I was\nthirteen, fourteen. I started making my own money selling shoes and stuff.\nThat's how I started buying my clothes.\n      \n      "
