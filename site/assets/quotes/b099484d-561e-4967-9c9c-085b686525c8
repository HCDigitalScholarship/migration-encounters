So I don't want to give any of my personal information\u201d.\n   Even if it's just for payment or just for providing any information,\n   knowing that they are calling their company, we're not calling them. It's\n   basically their information is secure with us and it's not just for being\n   Mexican that I'm going to rob them, but it happens all the time.\n \n \n  "
