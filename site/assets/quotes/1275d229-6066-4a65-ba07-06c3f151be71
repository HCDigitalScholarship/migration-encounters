What were some of the\n   challenges you had?\n \n \n   Josue: Like I said, I didn't know the city at all to begin with. I didn't\n   know anyone down here that could even like tell me how to get a job \u2018cause\n   I've never had to get a job with papers. You know, the right way. I never\n   did that. Yeah, so that would have been helpful.\n \n \n  "
