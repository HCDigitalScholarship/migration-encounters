  "text":"Frank: That's correct. And besides that it could be a program, let's say\n   for example, where I can develop my career over there, that will be\n   awesome. But there is for example on the bajada [lower part] of Canada here\n   they have programs for engineers to go as an outsourcing. To be honest I\n   know that the U.S. dollar compared to the Canada dollar, it's a little\n   cheaper Canada, but it's more than Mexican Pesos. That's why I'm planning\n   to be outsourcing. If I could get a good engineer here, it's better to\n   serve to my country, but if it's a possibility, I will be more than happy\n   to go back to USA.\n \n \n  "
