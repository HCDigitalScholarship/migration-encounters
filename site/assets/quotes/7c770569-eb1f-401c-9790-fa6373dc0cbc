  "text":"Lizzy: And I've heard some people say that they don't really feel like\n they're from here, they don't really feel like they're from there either.\n Do you feel like that at all, or do you feel more Mexican or more American?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I feel more like a human being from Earth. [Chuckles]. I'm not\n really even from any country in particular. I could be Japanese for all I\n know. It's just culture. It depends on what culture. But I like Mexican\n culture, it's super nice. Everybody says \u201cHello,\u201d \u201cGood morning,\u201d \u201cGood\n afternoon,\u201d when you come out of the house. That's really nice. Over there\n in the States, I wouldn't see that. So, there's big differences, there's\n differences in lifestyles. They both have their good and their bad. Just\n human, you know?\n      \n      \n Lizzy: I love that, I love that you said that. We're all humans. Yeah. Why\n do we need to divide it?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, I always thought about that. There shouldn't be a division in\n the world. Everybody can learn from everybody else. Like you're doing now,\n you can learn from me as I can learn from you. What's the difference? It's\n just the barriers we place on each other.\n      \n      \n"
