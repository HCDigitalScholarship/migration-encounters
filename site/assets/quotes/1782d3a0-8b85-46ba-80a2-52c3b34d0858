  "text":"Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little\n young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's\n always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm\n not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom\n provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and\n be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing\n something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they\n need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than\n myself. Like I said, shoe brands, all that stuff don't matter to me. I want\n to have my family, I want to be happy and make my kids happy. See my family\n grow and see my kids grow. See what they become,"
