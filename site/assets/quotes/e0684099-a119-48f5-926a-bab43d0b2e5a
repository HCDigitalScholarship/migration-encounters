But really it was the\n   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have\n   my studio in a month and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do\n   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I\n   didn't even plan it, but I stay.\n \n \n  "
