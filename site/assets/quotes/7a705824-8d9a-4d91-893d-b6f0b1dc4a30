  "text":"And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I\n got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front\n of a bunch of people. The website was legit\u2014it was if you search poetry on\n Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point\n where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate\n inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran\n around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that\n risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get\n deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.\n      \n      \n"
