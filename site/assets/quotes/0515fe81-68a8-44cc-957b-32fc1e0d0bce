  "text":"I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, \"How can people just, I\n   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,\n   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to\n   bleed the same.\" I'm like, \"It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the\n   same on the inside.\" I guess that was one of the few things because I\n   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,\n   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, \"Hey,\n   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one\n   of my workers.\" Christmas parties where the company invites the whole\n   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I\n   arrived to prison.\n \n \n  "
