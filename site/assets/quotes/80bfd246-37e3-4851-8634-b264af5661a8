  "text":"Laila: I don't know, it's just two different mentalities I guess, because\n   of where we come from and because of how a lot of us are raised. When\n   things are handed to us, we just take them for granted. So, in my point of\n   view, if the US government would want us immigrants to do things correctly\n   and go by their law, they should make it easier for us to do it, to do so.\n   We're not saying we're against paying taxes or against doing this, or\n   against doing that. Like, no. It would, a lot of families would be more\n   than happy to go by the law, but it is just very difficult to get\n   citizenship or something to be able to stay there legally and work.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Nearly impossible for a lot of people.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah it is.\n \n \n  "
