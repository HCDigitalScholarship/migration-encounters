  "text":"Rodolfo: That's what happened, that's really why they got me. I remember\n   when I was in Court they said, \"He has accumulated since he was 15. Since\n   he was 15 he accumulated a lot of driving tickets. He is dangerous to the\n   road.\" I'm like, \"What? [Incredulous]. All my tickets are because you guys\n   pull me over. It was late at night, I was the only car on the road. I mean,\n   obviously, if a police officer tails you for more than two miles, you're\n   gonna do something wrong in their eyes, right?\u201d That's just what happened.\n   I kept on driving, why? Because I went to school and I went to work, and\n   it's just easier, it's just more convenient to drive your car that you paid\n   for, than to go through the hassle of the CTA\u2014the CTA is the Chicago\n   Transit Authority.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, that's the way it was, but I always saw it as, \u201cMan, don't\n   let that affect you.\u201d But, hey man, it affected me all right? If I didn't\n   drive, I would probably still be over there.\n \n \n   Anita: What did they give you tickets for?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Driving with no valid drivers license. Then after two or three\n   time it turns into an aggravated... No, sorry, it turns into a felony. It's\n   just the same kind, but now it's a felony instead of a misdemeanor.\n \n \n   Anita: They just pulled you over because they saw that... Why did they pull\n   you over?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: One of the first times was because I had a busted taillight. I\n   didn't realize that the lightbulb had gone out. Then after that...Once\n   again, I didn't live in the best place around town, so police would always\n   be around. I guess they just saw me and they would always just get behind\n   me. It wasn't just me, it was other friends. Even when I would be with\n   other coworkers, it would happen the same way. In Rogers Park, by Evanston,\n   and even in Wrigleyville, a whole bunch of places, if it's late at night\n   and they just see one or two individuals, especially Hispanic or\n   African-American, they're gonna see what's going on.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: They're gonna want to see what's going on. That's what happened,\n   because I literally would ask them, \"Why did you pull me over?\" \"Improper\n   lane usage.\" All my tickets improper lane usage, failed to use turn signal.\n   It was really aggravating because it was like, \u201cMan bro, you see me with my\n   work uniform on, you see the food right next to me. Literally, here is my\n   work ID, this is where I work, and I'm coming from work. Please just let me\n   go home.\" \"Please step out of the car.\" Impound the car, or, I'm not gonna\n   lie, some of the times that I did get pulled over sometimes they just let\n   me leave the car, or they had me call somebody with a license, but that was\n   very, very rare that would happen.\n \n \n  "
