  "text":"Anita: Family separation? Is that difficult?\n \n \n   Melani: It's been hard because my parents are the only people I've known my\n   whole life and they're my rocks, the people I go to for everything. So\n   having them so distant has been really tough on me [Emotional]. I feel like\n   I can't talk to my own grandparents because I don't have that trust and\n   sometimes I just don't feel like there will ever be a connection since I've\n   lost so many years of my life that I should have lived with them.\n \n \n  "
