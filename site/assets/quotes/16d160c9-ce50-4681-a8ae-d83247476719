  "text":"Mike: No, that was actually... She was still in high school. She was in\n   senior year I believe. I wasn't in high school anymore, I was working at\n   that time, working for the Solar Spot. I had barely started working for the\n   Solar Spot and she kind of gave me motivation to do better. When you have\n   somebody, you want to take them out and do extra stuff. So you're like,\n   \"Yeah man, I got to get this money.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And that was another motivation that helped me kind of get up at a\n   higher level than I was. But it was just a lot of stuff. When you have kids\n   young, you think you want something, but you don't know. It's just like you\n   think you like the person but you don't like them. You just like them for\n   their looks or their body, and that was my mistake. And yes, she actually\n   told me if I wanted to marry her.\n \n \n   Mike: I didn't like her and I didn't want to do that to her. But she was\n   just wanting to help me out so I could get my papers, but I couldn't do it\n   to her, man. I just imagine myself like, \"Damn, she's going to marry me.\"\n   And then like, \"What if I'm not the right one, and then she's going to have\n   to go. She's taking that sacrifice for me. I don't feel like that's fair.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So we never got married. I never fixed anything. I could, I had the\n   chance because at that time they told me, \"Why don't you put your papers\n   in?\" My boss\u2014damn, that guy has helped me a lot. His name is Richard\n   Perkin. Man, that guy's like a second father to me. He did everything he\n   could to try to help me out and my status, but at that point it was already\n   too late because they had denied us for\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: Denied what?\n \n \n   Mike: Remember when I told you that my mom put in the Visa U or some stuff\n   like that? Since they denied us, they wouldn't give us another shot. I had\n   to wait a certain amount of years.\n \n \n  "
