Actually, my parents, they're from\n   a small village around thirty minutes from the city. The village is really\n   small. As I remember, we used to have dirt houses, small dirt houses. What\n   else? We didn't have any\u2026 Like the roads, it's like dust and ground, like\n   raw ground roads. What else? I remember that the people, they used to were\n   more kind. it was just love everywhere in my childhood. I used to be\n   shepherd, I used to have a sheep. I used to go to the mountains with my\n   sheeps, trying to feed them and everything. I used to have one small cow. I\n   used to have two horses and everything. After I immigrate to the US with\n   none English, I went there, live with my brother first, and I started went\n   to school, and started looking for a job actually. I was underage, so my\n   parents have to sign off the sheet for me to get a job.\n \n \n  "
