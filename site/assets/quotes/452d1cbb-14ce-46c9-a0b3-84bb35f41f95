  "text":"utting\n it simply, when I first got here, and I considered myself a lot more\n American than anything, quirks about people annoyed me or not their quirks,\n just their ways of certain expressions or it's a way of doing something.\n For me it was just like, \"Ugh, that's so not what I'm used to or that's so\n not accepted.\" But now it's more, I feel that I've become more flexible in\n that sense, with people, with culture, with everything. And yeah, I don't\n really think that you open your eyes to that until you have to live it. And\n so I definitely think it's a phenomenon to say you're too much of\n something, but I don't agree with it.\n      \n      \n"
