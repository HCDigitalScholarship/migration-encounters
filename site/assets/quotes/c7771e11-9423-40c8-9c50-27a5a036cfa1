  "text":"Axel: Yeah. That kind of follows up with your story. Like okay, at least he\n made the report so it must be something that really happened. Well, police,\n they won't do anything. I found that out almost a week or two after I got\n to Mexico. A lady got robbed for her purse. There's this area that\n everybody knows and they're like, \"You don't want to go in that area.\"\n Because it looks beautiful and everything because the houses are all\n different colors, they're painted all nicely and they look real nice, but\n everybody's like, \"You do not want to go down there.\" It was like, if you\n go in there, you're probably not going to come out or you're probably going\n to come out, but you're going to come out without your phone, your wallet,\n sometimes even throw you out just all naked, just for the hell of it.\n      \n      \n"
