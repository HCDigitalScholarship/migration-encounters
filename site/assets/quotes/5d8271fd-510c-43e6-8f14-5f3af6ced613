  "text":"there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go\n   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about\n   the culture.\n \n \n   Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three\n   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping\n   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to\n   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or\n   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp\n   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the\n   English.\n \n \n   Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and\n   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she\n   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was\n   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see\n   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the\n   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I\n   have all those papers. Basically with all my information, they were telling\n   me that because my immigration status, I cannot go to the White House.\n \n \n  "
