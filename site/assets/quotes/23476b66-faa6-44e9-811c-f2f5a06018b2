I got\n   released over there, and then I called my brother because he owes me money.\n   I called him just to tell him I'm here in Nuevo Laredo. Send me some money\n   because I got to come home. [Chuckles]. Well, yeah, that's how they found\n   out I got deported. I'm pretty sure they would\u2019ve helped me; they gave me\n   some money. But after that, no. That's when I got here.\n \n \n  "
