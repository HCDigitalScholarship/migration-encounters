  "text":"Anne: And so, you went alone? You got deported alone?\n \n \n   Laura: I was pretty scared cause I didn't know. Once I get there, I got to\n   Tijuana, and from there, I took a bus to here.\n \n \n   Anne: Was there anyone here to greet you or welcome you?\n \n \n   Laura: My family, my mom's family.\n \n \n   Anne: Your mom's family? Any government people?\n \n \n   Laura: No, nothing like that.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you knew that you had family here that you could come to?\n \n \n   Laura: I do have family here that I can come to. But, you know, sometimes\n   your family doesn't help too much.\n \n \n   Anne: How did that go?\n \n \n   Laura: It was fine, but I did have many problems with my family. Because I\n   didn't have my parents here, and as I mentioned to you, they didn't have\n   money to send me and sometimes they asked me for money to even eat.\n \n \n  "
