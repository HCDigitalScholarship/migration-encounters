  "text":"Jose: Actually, after I got kicked out, I was still living with my dad. But\n   I had a lot of issues with my dad. We got into a lot of arguments. So after\n   I got kicked out of school, he sort of kicked me out of the house and I\n   ended up living with a buddy and I started working with him. Not with him,\n   but we started working together and that's when I started making money.\n   That's when my mom came back to _____, and I was like, \u201cHey look. I'm\n   making enough money to help you out with bills and stuff. I feel like this\n   might be the best situation for right now.\u201d And whether she liked it or\n   not, she agreed with me and the following year, I came back and I dropped\n   out officially. And yeah. I started working.\n \n \n  "
