  "text":"Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction\n and so after a few years he got tired of that physically\u2014it was very\n physically demanding\u2014so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,\n he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me\n along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to\n want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and\n literally just because I had his last name, it was, \"Okay, you got the\n job.\" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would\n call him offering jobs or\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, \"Okay, I might not be able to go\n to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own\n kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.\" And so being\n under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were\n points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son\n anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be\n like, \"Yeah, I know who you are.\" At first it was all like, \"Okay, who are\n you?\" \u201cWell, I'm ____ son.\u201d \u201cOh wow. Okay, well here you go.\u201d But then\n after a while it was, \"Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you\n and we need you to pick our store back up.\" And so after that, that was my\n goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.\n      \n      \n"
