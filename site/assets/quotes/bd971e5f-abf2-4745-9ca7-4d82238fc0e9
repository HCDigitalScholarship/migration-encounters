  "text":"Rodrigo: After finishing high school. Then from there, I moved back to\n   Minnesota. In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass\n   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts. Even the\n   front end from the buses, they are made from fiberglass. Even parts for\n   airplanes. We used to make them, because they're made of fiberglass. That's\n   where I knew more English. That's when I started getting along with white\n   people. Right there, I met more Central American people. That was more\n   different, because over there, there is not a lot of Mexicans. So that's\n   where I learned more skills in English. At the same time, how they lived.\n   White people, how they lived, black people, how they lived. We will see a\n   few black people there. But we will see Indian people, how they lived.\n   Bosnian people.\n \n \n   Anita: What was different about the way that the white people lived to the\n   way the Mexicans lived?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much it depends on the persons because you could find\n   a racist person, or you could find a person that tried to be a Mexican\u2014or\n   not to be a Mexican but get someone with Mexicans. That's when you compared\n   those persons. Because some people, they don't care, they just see you, and\n   some persons, they want to know how you lived, how everything goes. Some\n   persons, they don't even care about you. When that happens, I got to know a\n   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my\n   best friends.\n \n \n  "
