  "text":"ita: That's pretty cool.\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, I'm sorry for doing that just, I have to burst out and sing.\n      \n      \n Anita: Yeah, no that was great. That was fantastic. So, as you can tell,\n Billy is a musician.\n      \n      \n Billy: I love music, I love to sing. It's just... it's like a form of\n therapy for me. Yeah. It really is.\n      \n      \n Anita: Do you sing Mexican stuff or just...?\n      \n      \n Billy: You know what, it's embarrassing because a lot of people tell me,\n \"Oh, sing this Jose, Jose song or Mexican traditional songs,\u201d and I don't\n know them and so it's like, \"Bro, I'm sorry. I don't know it.\" I only play\n grandpa music.\n      \n      \n Anita: But it's grandpa American music?\n      \n      \n Billy: It's American music history and if it wasn't for that there wouldn't\n be a lot of genres today. I really like that old stuff, for sure.\n      \n      \n Anita: And how did you get exposed to that old stuff?\n      \n      \n Billy: So, that was in North Carolina. I was actually going through a\n really big depression. I didn't know what to do anymore, being illegal in\n the U.S, not being able to find jobs, not being able to go into college was\n difficult for me so I was falling into a depression. And then I came across\n this guy called Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson is the king of the Delta\n blues. He's one of the most important American musicians, ever.\n      \n      \n Billy: So, I started listening to his music and just the pain and the story\n of him uplifted me. He was letting me know, \"You know what, you're healthy.\n You're young. Look at these African American people back in the day, what\n they went through and compared to what you're going through? Don't be a\n sissy and don't complain.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So that music just uplifted me, and it gave me energy and it let me\n know, \"Bro, you don't have to just be this kid with\u201d\u2014because I had a lot of\n anxiety\u2014\"This kid with anxiety. You can play music and make people feel\n good.\" And so that helped me out a lot and eventually that led me to, and\n this is going to sound weird but, it led me to discover the purpose of what\n a human is because, listen to this, when you play music, you're helping\n other people out, right? And you're really contributing to the change that\n you want to live in the future.\n      \n      \n Billy: And I was, like, \"Dude, what's the purpose of a human being? Why are\n we here?\" And it's simply to help others. That's all it is. It is to\n contribute to the change you want to live in and it's very fulfilling when\n you help somebody. And so that let me know, \"Dude, you're here to help\n others and, yeah, just do it.\"\n      \n      \n B"
