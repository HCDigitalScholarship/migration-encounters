  "text":"Rodolfo: Now I still haven't been pointed towards the right direction as to\n   how to go about doing that. I mean, I've looked for help but I always come\n   to a dead end. And it varies from city to city. Because somebody who I was\n   with in the detention center\u2014we left the same day and everything\u2014but he's\n   from Monterey and he actually he actually got 30,000 pesos from the Mexican\n   government. I'm not sure what branch it was from or where exactly it came\n   from, but he showed me everything. He proved it to me, so I know there is\n   help, but I feel like there is not that much awareness.\n \n \n  "
