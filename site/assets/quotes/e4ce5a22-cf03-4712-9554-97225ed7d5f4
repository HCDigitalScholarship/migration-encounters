  "text":"Yeah, most likely the opposite. When you get deported you can't\n   bring anything with you, it's not like you can bring your house with you\n   [Chuckles]. We had our house in the States, it was ours. Well, it was my\n   mom's. She had bought it and she was paying for it but when we got\n   deported, my brothers weren't able to continue paying it, so it got taken\n   away. So my mom said, \"It's not like I could have brought it over here. If\n   I could've bought it over here I would have because it was mine.\" She said\n   all of our hard work and all of our, everything we gave up to have\n   something of our own, it just completely went away.\n \n \n  "
