  "text":"Anita: I have one more reflection question. Some women who we have spoken\n   to who, like you, were undocumented in the States end up in trouble. Some\n   become young mothers as teenagers, some join gangs. If somebody asked you,\n   \"Why does this happen?\" what would you say?\n \n \n   Melani: I would say that a lot of Latinas, especially young Latinas have\n   kids or [join] gangs. Latinos have that mentality that you have to get\n   married very young and that women are just used for recreation, having a\n   family -- not for anything else because we have that type of \u2026 it's a man's\n   world here. It's not a woman's world. So if things back home were kind of\n   tough for women, here it's a million times worse, because we're really\n   oppressed and we still have rights, but you still aren't respected as a\n   woman, and so many women just go the easy way, saying, \"Well I'll get\n   pregnant early and finish it off and just live the rest of my life with my\n   kids and dedicate myself to them,\" or some women don't want to do that and\n   they just say, \"Well, I want money and I know I don't have opportunities\n   because of the economy and all of the things that are happening in my\n   background, so I guess I'll just join a gang and do all these things so I\n   can have easy money and opportunities for other things.\"\n \n \n  "
