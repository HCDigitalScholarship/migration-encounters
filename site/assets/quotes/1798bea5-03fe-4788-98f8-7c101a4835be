  "text":"[49:44] Then my dad came back and then I was living with my mom. I guess\n   that was one of the most difficult part of my life was being with my mom\n   and watching her struggle because I couldn't really work because I didn't\n   have the papers. She could because she also had an illegal name there. She\n   wasn't working under her name. She had another person's papers. She was\n   able to work, but instead of my dad helping her out, it was on her. Of\n   course, she had car payments, rent, bills. That's when I saw and I said,\n   \"Hey, I need to do something. If I stay here, all I am doing is causing my\n   mom to spend more money.\" So, I told her, \"Hey, I think I'm going to go\n   back.\" Then I came to Mexico. She still stayed there. She was probably\n   there for 20 years. But she moved to a different city.\n \n \n  "
