Do you have a\n memory of your first time seeing it or that first day?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I remember when we barely came through the border, we stopped at a\n gas station, and the guy bought me a drink and a Snickers. It was like a\n SoBe, and I remember that drink really a lot because after that I would\n always drink it. It's one of my favorites. [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So, it's been your favorite since day one?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. I remember that, and then I remember going on the highway, and\n just seeing everything and everything looked super nice and stuff.\n [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n"
