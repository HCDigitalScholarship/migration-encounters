  "text":"Diana: It was in the movie theaters, yeah. That was actually my first job\n   of all.\n \n \n   Anita: Really?\n \n \n   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.\n \n \n   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?\n \n \n   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work\n   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants\n   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.\n \n \n   Anita: Why?\n \n \n   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the\n   movie theaters and then they \u2013 is because you know how you don't say that\n   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was\n   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real\n   or anything. I had fake papers.\n \n \n   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?\n \n \n   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to\n   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know\n   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the\n   50s or stuff like that. So there's a \u2026 but they don't really \u2013 I'm pretty\n   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,\n   okay don't know them.\n \n \n  "
