  "text":"Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn\n   the good way, \"All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.\" They\n   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too\n   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I\n   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.\n \n \n  "
