  "text":"Ivan: Well, I knew I was undocumented, but I started realizing I was in\n   danger when I started driving and working. But that time I was like, I need\n   to be careful all the time. I'm not getting stopped or anything. When I was\n   in high school, all the school process, I was happy. But whenever I had to\n   go to work, that was like, I need to be careful. Those are the times I\n   realized, this is not my country. I was not born here. So if I do anything\n   wrong, I will be sent back.\n \n"
