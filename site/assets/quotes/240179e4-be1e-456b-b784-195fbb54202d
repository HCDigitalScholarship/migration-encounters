  "text":"Anita: Things got difficult for you guys after that, right?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yes, it actually did. I mean, as it was we were low income and with\n   that situation it actually got difficult for my dad to keep going to work.\n \n \n   Anita: Isn't it after that that they started deporting people.\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah, actually, they started deporting people at the time. My\n   parents got lucky because they had been over there for a minute and they\n   basically had records and they applied and they actually got their permit\n   to be there. I remember my little sister was like three years old. She was\n   really scared. She was scared and at the same time, she will say, \"Go get\n   me a game, go get me a game.\" Something to keep her busy.\n \n \n   Anita: So did the police get tougher on you guys after that?\n \n \n   Ruben: Well, it actually got tough on everybody, on the whole community\n   around there because it was more African American people. But with us it\n   will be only with certain people.\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah.\n \n \n   Ruben: They will stop people to see if they got a driver's license. I\n   remember there was no transportation for a couple of days. So my dad had to\n   work, I mean had to walk from two in the morning till five to get to work,\n   and at night he will get home at 12 at night. Because he had two jobs. But\n   we lived through it. We became a little stronger and stronger minded but\n   took us like around nine months.\n \n \n  "
