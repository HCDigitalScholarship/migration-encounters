  "text":"Donovan: Yeah. I felt like that was something that I needed to do because I\n   consider myself not too literate, at some point ignorant, because I don't\n   like reading books. Now that I'm starting to read books so that I'm around\n   people that are super educated, I see that the culture, the religions that\n   I think were forced upon us. And CNC, we were still slaves. We're still\n   slaves to that religion. That's not our religion. Now, if you look at the\n   Virgin Mary, the Virgin Mary is a resemblance of Tonantzin (Nahuatl),\n   mother earth. It's like they do a lot of stuff to just enslave you. All the\n   pyramids they destroyed, there's only I think 10% of the books that survive\n   after they burned all the books. You had open brain surgery already at that\n   age. We had dental work already. We had so much medicine. We had studies in\n   astronomy. Our Aztec calendar to this day is one of the most exact\n   calendars. It's like, you were evolving so much, so much, and then we just\n   got chopped down. And that to me is frustrating.\n \n \n  "
