  "text":"Rocio: They say I need to follow the report. And even the immigration guy,\n   he stopped in the middle of the road and he told me, \u201cWho did this to you?\u201d\n   I mean I told him my kids, my apartment, my car\u2014because the police were\n   arriving and I was in a towel because I was in the shower and they don't\n   let me dress, so he took me to the police car and we wait for an hour. I\n   was in my towel and then immigration guy arrived and he told me, \u201cWhat are\n   you doing almost naked here?\u201d And I said, \u201cWell he don't even let me get\n   pants or something.\u201d So he let me get in my house, get dressed and he told\n   me, get your papers, your birth certificate for your kids and everything\n   you think you're going to need.\n \n \n  "
