I still don't know because I don't even know what road to take.\n   There's so many, but I just want to help. Like I said, I want to be the\n   person that I never had growing up. I don't know what that is though still,\n   or whatever it is.\n \n \n   Anne: You're very young.\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. I feel like I'm getting old [Laughs]. Sucks.\n \n \n   Anne: Well, not having a childhood you must feel way older than your years.\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: You\u2019ve got a lot of time ahead of you to really achieve those dreams.\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. Now I kind of believe it and it's kind of like, \"Okay, yeah.\n   You could do it.\"\n \n \n  "
