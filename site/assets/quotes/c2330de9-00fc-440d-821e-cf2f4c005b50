I'm starting to like it because I love to help people you know? And I\n   start when the situation with the DACA start in United States, I was like,\n   \u201cThis is not fair, this can't be happening.\u201d I have thousands of friends in\n   United States that took their kids very young, one, two years old. And the\n   future was going to be for them, you know? And if they took the kids, the\n   parent stay or if they took the parent back, what would the kids going to\n   do in the United States? My kids were so lucky to have my daughter, her\n   father, and my son, my friend. But even though that's illegal because they\n   just have a paper, we haven't been able to do nothing really legal because\n   it's too expensive.\n \n \n  "
