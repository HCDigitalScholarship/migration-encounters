  "text":"Anne: What would you study? What are you thinking? Theater?\n      \n      \n Brenda: I think here it's harder, I took a course a couple of years ago. It\n was like a Shakespeare course and it was all in English and I remember\n being like, \u201cOh, this is the luckiest thing I've ever found.\u201d I took it and\n I liked it a lot. But I know when I would try to speak to some of the other\n guys in Spanish, it was hard. My Spanish has gotten better, but it's still\n hard to communicate certain things. So probably not theater. I like cooking\n a lot. So maybe something like gastronomy or I looked a lot into sociology,\n insight, and psychology. I like those for all being interesting.\n      \n      \n"
