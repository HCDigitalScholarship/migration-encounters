  "text":"Zayuri: Yeah. It's just better for me, for my mental health in general\n   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I\n   get headaches and stuff. I was like, \"Yep, got to get out of here.\"\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.\n \n \n   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].\n \n \n   Isabel: I'm the same way.\n \n \n   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they\n   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I\n   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because\n   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't\n   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and\n   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are\n   here in Mexico, my father\u2014well, my mom\u2014because they separated. Now she's\n   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes\n   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, \"Why do they\n   have that and I didn't?\" I'm really happy for them. I understand that they\n   are just getting better.\n \n \n  "
