  "text":"Anne: Do you think being in the US changed your life, changed you in any\n   significant ways?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes, because I lived in Provo, where all the Mormons are, and most of\n   them are humble, most of them are nice people. I guess I got used to that.\n   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way\n   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from\n   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a\n   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different\n   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.\n \n \n   Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way\n   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to\n   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be\n   respectful to everybody. The way you treat me is how I will treat you,\n   that's the way I will always treat people with respect and stuff like that.\n   In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US because I do have a\n   different lookout in life.\n \n \n   Anne: What do you miss most about the US?\n \n \n   Juan: The vegetation, the nature, because I remember in the US I can go out\n   in the soccer fields and there's actual grass. The mountains.\n \n \n   Anne: It's beautiful.\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. That's what I miss most about it, the nature.\n \n \n  "
