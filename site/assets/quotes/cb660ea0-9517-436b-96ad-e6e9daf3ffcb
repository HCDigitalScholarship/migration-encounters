My\n parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and\n fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of\n that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody\n because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or\n leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.\n      \n      \n"
