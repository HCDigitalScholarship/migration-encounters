  "text":"Anne: So when you said they took us to Disneyland, us meaning you and your\n   siblings?\n \n \n   Miguel: Right. It was actually my whole family that migrated from Mexico to\n   the United States, which was my two uncles, which are my dad's brothers and\n   my two aunts, which are my uncles' wives, two boy cousins and a girl\n   cousin. We all went together to Disneyland, my mom and myself and my dad.\n   And it was great. It was a lot of fun. We went to Universal Studios. Then I\n   remember during that time, there was still the King Kong train where they\n   took us, the ET thing where we were on the bikes. I had a lot of great\n   memories from when I was younger there.\n \n \n   Anne: That seems really, how old were you when you went to Disneyland?\n \n \n   Miguel: I think we were about eight years old. And I remember that during\n   that time I remember we were like big fans of the Pogs, the little things\n   that you play with like the Slammers. Yeah I know that. A big fan of\n   Batman, I've always been a big fan of Batman and I loved being there when I\n   was younger, I had a good childhood when I was in California."
