  "text":"Joana: She came to Mexico and she came to pick me up, and I pretty much\n   traveled with her except when I was going to across the border.\n \n \n   Anita: Except when you were crossing the border?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes.I was four at that time.\n \n \n   Anita: Was it hard to leave?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, because basically I didn't know her at all. I grew up with my\n   grandma. That was my mother figure. So, I didn't really know her at all.\n   And when I first met her, I didn't even talk to her. I didn't have the\n   confidence. I didn't, well, like I said, it was like a new person to me\n   that I didn't know anything about. I hadn't talked to her on the phone\n   ever, because supposedly when she called, my grandma would say that I was\n   asleep or I was playing outside or anything else, but that I wasn't there.\n \n \n   Anita: Why?\n \n \n   Joana: That was because I stayed with my grandma from my dad's side.\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Joana: My dad never called either. He never supported me economically.\n   Yeah, they actually did have a fight over me, a legal fight, because my\n   grandma didn't want to let me go, but she was my mother. So, under the law,\n   I was supposed to be with her. Not with my grandma. Basically, I had to\n   leave with her, because they couldn't do anything to hold me back.\n \n \n  "
