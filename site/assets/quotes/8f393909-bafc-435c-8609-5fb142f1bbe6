  "text":"Brenda: Yes, but they were born over there, so it's different. When I left,\n they were three and five. Since I couldn't work and I couldn't drive or\n anything, I've always babysat them. I was their mom up until some point\n because my mom worked most days and so that was really hard because now the\n oldest is fourteen and the next one is twelve so it's a whole world of\n difference. The three-year-old when I left, he thought I was his mom. My\n mom told me that when I left on the bus he was like, \"Brenda come back,\n I'll be good. I promise.\" He was just crying and crying. [Emotional]\n      \n      \n Anne: I'm sorry.\n      \n      \n Brenda: It's been a while and now it's just \u2026 One is a teenager and she had\n to deal with my family drifting apart when us two left. A lot of things\n happening because my mom had a hard time dealing with half of her children\n being here. So, the oldest is very straightforward, very grumpy sometimes.\n It's always weird because I think about her when she was five and now, and\n I'm like so much responsibility fell on her when I left. [Emotional] And\n the little one [Chuckle], he always says \u201cHi\u201d to me, but he doesn't\n remember me as well anymore because he was two or three when I left. So, I\n think them too, they're the hardest part [Sniffles].\n      \n      \n"
