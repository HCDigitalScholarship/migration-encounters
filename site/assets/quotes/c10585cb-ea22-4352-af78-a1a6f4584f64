  "text":"I guess that first police officer, he was normal about it. He was like,\n   \"I'm just doing my job. You have to go here.\" Then once I got actually\n   arrested, that's when things changed because they treated me like if I were\n   an animal, or if I had done something really wrong. It wasn't the case. I\n   did get in trouble like any normal kid. I don't know, maybe breaking\n   something or with other guys playing in the street or fighting or things\n   like that, but I don't know. I guess after I got arrested, and they put the\n   handcuffs on me, that's when they started treating me like if I were a\n   criminal. I said, \"Why? I didn't do anything. I was only seven years old\n   when I crossed.\" But I thought I crossed like everybody does. I guess it\n   was after I got arrested that I started seeing the real discrimination with\n   the authorities. In school, maybe just a typical guy that says, \"Hey, you\n   don't belong here.\" I would fight back saying, \"Hey, you don't either\n   because your ancestors are not even from America.\"\n \n \n  "
