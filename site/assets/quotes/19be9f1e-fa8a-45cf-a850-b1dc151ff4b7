  "text":"Zayuri: Yeah. She's still in the United States. She's trying to get here. I\n   met her two years ago. Her name is Rosalind. She did help me out a lot of\n   times, but I didn't want to go her name. I just don't like to get names on\n   me. So, I was like, \"Yep, I'm going to get a rose,\" because I have a great\n   imagination, and that's all that I could come up with.\" Then I got this for\n   a song, and this is just right here. I am going to get this one covered up\n   because I really hate it.\n \n \n  "
