  "text":"Of course. I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big\n   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a\n   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.\n   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I\n   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go\n   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They\n   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side."
