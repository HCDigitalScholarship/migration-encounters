  "text":"Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they\n   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy\n   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy\n   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more\n   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.\n   During the summer reading programs\u2014I'm not sure if you know, but in the\n   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.\n \n \n  "
