  "text":"Jeimmy: I like electronic music. For example, I like Adela, I like Amy\n   Winehouse. I love a lot of, well like Charlie Puth, I don't know. I like\n   that type of music. But I also like not necessarily Mexican, but Latina.\n   For example, I like Calle Trece. Calle Trece I think is like Puerto Rican\n   or something like that. I love Calle Trece. What I don't like that's\n   Mexican, and people criticize me for that, is I don't like Banda. I don't\n   like Nortenas, I don't like soccer, for example. [Interview laughs].\n \n \n  "
