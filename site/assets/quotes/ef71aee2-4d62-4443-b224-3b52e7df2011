I got\n   involved. I mean, I lived right there.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah. Were these gangs or just casual groups?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, some of them. Well actually, a few of my cousins they\n   were already involved in gangs, so it was pretty easy for me to get used to\n   that.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah, slip into that lifestyle, I bet.\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: And that was when you were around 14 years old?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: So did you stop playing soccer then, around there?\n \n \n   Pablo: Mm-hmm (affirmative).
