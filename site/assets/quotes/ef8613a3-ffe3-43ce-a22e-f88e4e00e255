  "text":"Mike: Yeah. And right there, from then on I was just like, \"You know what?\n   It's whatever. What's the point of even trying?\" It kind of messed me up,\n   got me depressed a little bit. I started hanging out with bad people, doing\n   the wrong things, and I dropped out my senior year.\n \n \n   Mike: I remember that day. Damn, that was crazy. I don't know why I did it.\n   I just like... I just said, \"Screw it. Nothing's ever going to happen for\n   me, so why even try?\""
