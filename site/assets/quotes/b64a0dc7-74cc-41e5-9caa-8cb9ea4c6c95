  "text":"Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected\n   your life. Can you talk about that too?\n \n \n   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire\n   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that\n   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to\n   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't\n   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You\n   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you\n   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd\n   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled\n   over? My mom\u2014she\u2019s an amazing driver\u2014but what if she got pulled over? What\n   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing\n   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the\n   shadows. Nobody really knows.\n \n \n  "
