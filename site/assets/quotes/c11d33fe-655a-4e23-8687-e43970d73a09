What were your\n   ideas?\n \n \n   Hugo: Well I don't know. Like at work sometimes, they apply for visas and\n   stuff like that, but I don't know if its related to any programs of trying\n   to go back or anything. But regardless of that, all I know if there was\n   something like that, you would have to show that you've been doing\n   something good for a while.\n \n \n   Anne: And that's what you're doing.\n \n \n   Hugo: Yes. I'm taking care of mine. I'm doing what I'm supposed to.\n \n \n  "
