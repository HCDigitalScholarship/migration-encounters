  "text":"Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?\n \n \n   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the\n   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original\n   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's\n   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into\n   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a\n   huge reader [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy\u2014extremely fascinated by human\n   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,\n   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed\n   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have\n   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.\n   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book \u2026 I don't know.\n   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained\n   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black\n   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and\n   when Mr. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,\n   historical fiction. I was into everything.\n \n \n  "
