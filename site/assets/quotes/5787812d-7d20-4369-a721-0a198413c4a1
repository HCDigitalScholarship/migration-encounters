  "text":"Axel: And authorities don't really do much to help. They almost kind of get\n mad at you for getting robbed. They're like, \"We told you not to have your\n things out in the open, we told you to check your pockets and make sure you\n have your things in your chest or a visible spot or a spot where you can\n feel that you're getting to get them swiped out.\" It's not really a big\n help. Then it comes down to that part, they're like, \"Well, it's gone now.\"\n He's like, \"Whoever it was, wherever they are now, it's gone.\""
