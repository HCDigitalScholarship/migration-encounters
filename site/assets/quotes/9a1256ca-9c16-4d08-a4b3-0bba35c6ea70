  "text":"Mike: I had it in my ear when I was coming out of the\u2014there was a hotel and\n   the casino and in the middle they joined and in that middle part there is\n   security. So I was walking out going to the casino and they seen it in my\n   ear and they're like, \"What is that?\" And I was like, \"Aw damn, I'm done.\"\n   I knew it so I was like, \"Dude, I'm done.\"\n \n \n   Mike: They took me downstairs, checked me, and then they let me go. But\n   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next\n   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.\n   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I\n   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out\n   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going\n   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.\n \n \n   Mike: So they were like, \"Dude, you got to do something. You either going\n   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to\n   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do\n   a voluntary departure and you go.\" At that time I felt like I wasn't any\n   good to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on my family.\" So I just\n   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran\n   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was\n   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I\n   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just\n   said, \"Screw it.\"\n \n \n  "
