  "text":"Yair: But my experience, to come back over here to Mexico is ... I don't\n   know. I always see it as a sign of God, or I don't know. It changed my life\n   really, really, completely. The way of seeing things too, here from over\n   there. I don't really have that ... I can't really explain what I mean, to\n   tell you the experience. I don't know. The experience will be, just for me,\n   living in another country and switching back in place, and that's it. It's\n   not that much, because most of the time that I was over there in the United\n   States, I was referred to as a kid. I don't really remember everything, but\n   being here, I just had to deal with it and just stay, see what comes up,\n   yeah.\n \n \n  "
