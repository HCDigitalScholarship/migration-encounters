  "text":"Anita: Let's talk about that. We're talking about fourth grade?\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, fourth grade.\n \n \n   Anita: Tell me about that. You loved to read, right?\n \n \n   Luisa: I loved to read. That was my escape from reality.\n \n \n   Anita: Tell me about Scholastic storybooks, and also tell me about where\n   you would go and read.\n \n \n   Luisa: In eighth grade?\n \n \n   Anita: Yes.\n \n \n   Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they\n   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy\n   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy\n   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more\n   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.\n   During the summer reading programs\u2014I'm not sure if you know, but in the\n   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.\n \n \n   Luisa: I was always the top winner because \u2026 they knew me. I knew the\n   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a\n   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. \u201cOh, your\n   book is here.\u201d I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill\n   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to\n   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was\n   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a\n   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books\u2014so many.\n \n \n  "
