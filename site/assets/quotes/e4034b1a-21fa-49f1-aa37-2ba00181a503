  "text":"I was supposed to come here and then we were eventually going to\n have a meeting at the consulate in Juarez and then be able to go back at\n some point.\n      \n      \n Anne: What happened? Why didn't it work out?\n      \n      \n Brenda: We waited a long time. It was about a year and a half because\n everybody was like, \u201cIt's going to be about three or six months, three or\n six months.\u201d And that passed, we were finally stuck there and it was\n because of the Hague Convention\u2014if I'm not mistaken\u2014which is like an\n international adoption thing that a lot of countries sign into to try to\n avoid human trafficking for children. Everything that we did with my aunt,\n which was technically live with her for two years, begin the adoption\n process before I was fifteen. All of these things that we did, we were\n supposed to have done them here in Mexico. And we tried to dispute it\n because we were like, \"We've never lived in Mexico and my aunt's not from\n Mexico. Why would we go to Mexico to do this?\" So they're like, \"No, but\n you can keep appealing it. But that's the process, you were supposed to do\n all of that in Mexico.\" The point is that we didn't want to, there was no\n reason for us to go to Mexico. We've never been there, my brother left when\n he was one and I was three. So, we were always in the US and so it didn't\n get declined completely, it just got, I guess, on hold and it's been like\n that for the last\u2014when did this happen\u2014like five, six years? So on my end,\n I'm good being here. I like being here, but it's because of my brother and\n his autism and he's very much in his own world of his habits and what his\n plans are and everything. It was really hard for him to come.\n      \n      \n Brenda: It was a complete disruption to his routine. It was a complete\u2014like\n being away from his parents, being with people he didn't really know that\n well. Being in a different country, like language he doesn't speak as\n well\u2014everything was hard. So, I don't touch that process because I know\n it's technically still going on and the hope is that one day he can go\n back. Me, I'd be happy to just go visit once, maybe often. But for him,\n because for him, it's so important to go back to the US.\n      \n      \n"
