  "text":"Mike: She took us to Los Angeles to live with my uncle, and I remember we\n   moved back to Arizona, because we thought my dad wasn't there anymore.\n   Well, we were staying in this little spot called Conway, Arizona\u2014like two,\n   three months. And at that time my dad found us\u2014because one of my family\n   members told him where we were\u2014and he tied my mom up, went in there with\n   another guy, masks on and kidnapped us.\n \n \n   Mike: He took us to Texas for two years. We were actually on the news as\n   missing children. If you look me up, I have all our photos. We were gone\n   for two years, and the reason that they found us was because my dad was\n   actually trying to rob a wheel store\u2014rim store. He broke in and the police\n   got him, and they took him to jail, but they had no idea who he was or he\n   was being looked for.\n \n \n  "
