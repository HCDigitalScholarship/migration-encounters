  "text":"I was about two. I was about two years old, before we went to the\n   States. That was another reason why my dad decided to go to the States,\n   because he saw that and he said, \"You can't have progress here because if\n   they see that you have something new, if other people see that you have\n   something that you have barely bought or something, they're going to want\n   it and they're going to want to take it away.\" And to leave your family, or\n   to have your father get killed over a car, it sounds stupid to me, but it's\n   a reality a lot of people face. To get shot down for a car, a motorcycle,\n   for a phone. For a phone. I mean, it's a phone. A lot of people take it for\n   granted, but if you walk around with your phone in hand, you'll get robbed\n   at gunpoint for it. A lot of people don't see that or don't understand\n   that. That a lot of migrant families leave because it is very violent in\n   their home countries. And that's something that I would like for them to\n   try to understand, just a little bit. A lot of violence is just scary, and\n   you wouldn't want your kids to get robbed at gunpoint outside of their\n   middle school because, I don't know, some guys just want their phone. So,\n   yeah [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
