  "text":"Ivan: No. That time I was 19. And I had missed so much from this country. I\n   didn't know where to go, how to move around. I didn't know anything. So I\n   stayed here for three months and I tried to look for jobs. But at that time\n   the industry was so different. There was not a lot call centers. I didn't\n   know I could go to a call center because I spoke English and just get a\n   job. So it was hard for me. I was looking for some other options and I was\n   not able to get a job. So I was like, hmm, I need to go back.\n \n"
