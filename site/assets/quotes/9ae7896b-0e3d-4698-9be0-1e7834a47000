  "text":"I remember when I first got picked up, they took me to\n   Wisconsin\u2014I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois\u2014for processing.\n   That was the processing center.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: They took my fingerprint and my name, first and last name and\n   everything. Right? So I wasn't\u2026 I'm sorry, I lost my train of thought. They\n   took my name and everything, right? But then they had a form in front of me\n   and they told me here, sign here and you know you'll be all set. And I\n   asked them, \u201cWell here, give me a second, let me read it.\u201d And there was\n   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four\n   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner\n   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera. And I told\n   everybody\u2014 I was the only one who spoke English or perfect English at\n   that\u2014\"Hey man, don't sign anything at all until you know what you're\n   signing because you don't know what you're signing. For all you know you're\n   signing your liver away. So, just don't sign anything.\u201d And the guy told\n   me, \u201cHey man, shut your mouth. We're talking to you; we're not talking to\n   them. I'm talking to you. Don't be a hero or don't be a jailhouse lawyer.\u201d\n   I'm like, \u201cA jailhouse lawyer? I'm not in jail.\u201d\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And they told me, \u201cJust sign here.\u201d I'm like, \u201cNo, I'm not going\n   to sign it.\u201d And I started reading through it, and it basically everything\n   that it said was, \u201cI waive my right to an appeal. I waive my right to any\n   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.\u201d And I'm like,\n   \u201cSo you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what\n   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?\u201d\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Because they told me, \u201cWe're not going to let you speak to your\n   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't\n   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.\u201d Because they even\n   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's\n   a federal crime punishable by between\u2014I think it was like\u2014three to seven\n   years in federal prison.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics\n   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect\n   me. I'm like, \u201cOkay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I\n   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.\n   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I\n   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.\u201d\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And they told me, \u201cWait right here.\u201d And then they went to go get\n   a supervisor, and the supervisor spoke to me in private and he gave me\n   another form and he was like, \u201cOkay, you want a proper hearing? Sign here.\u201d\n   And I read it and, okay here, then like, man, this is what it is? It took\n   me getting loud with you. I was a bit belligerent, I'm not going to lie to\n   you tell you I was the best, as they called me, \u201cdetainee.\u201d But I'm going\n   to fight for my home. I understand I was born in Mexico, but Chicago's my\n   home, it's my land, that's where I'm from. And whatever I can do to stay\n   there, I'd be okay.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And so, yeah, that's what it was. But it took me probably a good,\n   five months before I could see a judge.\n \n \n   Sergio: You were in detention that whole time?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I was in detention. I was in a detention center for five months.\n \n \n   Sergio: Before seeing the judge?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Before seeing the judge. And it wasn't even a formal hearing I\n   did. It was over the internet and the monitors, surprisingly that day, did\n   not work. So, all I heard was voices and I told them \u201cNo, I want a proper\n   hearing. I can't see the judge. For all I know there's a guy in the next\n   room talking to me and there's no judge.\u201d \u201cOkay, well you're going to have\n   to wait on a whole another six months.\u201d And I'm not going to lie to you,\n   those detention centers aren't all that pretty, you know what I mean?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I just didn't want to be locked up anymore. That, honestly, that\n   scared me. I didn't want to do another whole six months. By that point, I\n   would've done a year just to go see one judge for a bond. Finally, I said,\n   \u201cYeah, you know what? Yeah, I want one. I'll take the six months, give me\n   the six months. Just so I can see a judge.\u201d Surprisingly, there was another\n   court hearing, I think, a month from then. So, I finally got to see the\n   judge, but they set the bond at $50,000. And I don't have a $50,000, my\n   family doesn't have $50,000. So, I sat there. I sat the two and a half\n   years because I wanted to fight it. Every possible angle that I could\n   probably touch, I tried it.\n \n \n  "
