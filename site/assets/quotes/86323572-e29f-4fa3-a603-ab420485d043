Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them\n   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate\n   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think\n   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon\n   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his\n   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back\n   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're\n   human beings.\n \n \n  "
