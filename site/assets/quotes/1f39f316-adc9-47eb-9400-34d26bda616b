  "text":"Ruben: So that's the things you got to change from them. They used to call\n   me \"cholo\", a lot of them. Now they call me Ruben. Finally, after like a\n   month, they will be like \"What's your name? I don't want to be calling you\n   \"cholo\". What's your real name?\" \"Ruben.\" \"Oh, okay.\" Now they call me\n   Ruben. I can go and have a talk with them, laugh, and that's all around\n   here. When I lived in Estado de Mexico, it was the same thing. My\n   neighbors, I would talk to them, \"Good morning\". I would sweep the whole\n   sidewalk all the way to the corner and people would be like, \"Why you\n   sweeping in front of my house?\" I'd be like, \"I don't know. I felt like it,\n   so I just swept the whole street. Is there a problem? I'll put your trash\n   back.\" But they started liking it, and they got used to it, too, like\n   \"Ruben will clean''.\n \n \n  "
