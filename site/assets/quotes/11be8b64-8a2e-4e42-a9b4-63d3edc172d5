It got boring for me and I was really good. I should\n   have never started.\n \n \n   Mike: I remember I was taking Japanese, I was taking English, social\n   studies, a bunch of extra stuff just to try to advance my knowledge and\n   stuff, but I don't know. Once you don't get that motivation and wants to\n   stop, it sucks.\n \n \n  "
