  "text":"Anne: So, what happened? What happened to bring you to detention and\n deportation?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, this last issue had to do with labor. I was used to these\n labor department investigations and this last few really started getting\n more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the\n Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all\n the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, for the federal contractors?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. And I'm an illegal alien, but you can look me up in the\n Michigan records. And I'm registered there as a preferred government\n contractor. I did well over 200,000 units and for Amtrak, which is in a bad\n area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,\n Indiana and Ohio, Florida and Mississippi, Texas, I was a preferred\n government contractor. And did they know I was illegal? Damn right they\n did.\n      \n      \n Anne: They did?\n      \n      \n Ben: I know they did. There's no way that they couldn't have known. Did\n they care? No. They just needed their job done.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: At the end, I think they still didn't care but I think the heat\n got turned up and they started\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: That's all you can think of?\n      \n      \n"
