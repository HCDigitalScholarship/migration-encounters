  "text":"The fear. The constant fear, that actually came true [Chuckles], of\n   your family members being deported or coming home from school because since\n   I was underage, I kind of knew that I was safe from that because they\n   weren't going to raid schools, like middle schools and stuff like that. But\n   it was a constant fear of coming home and being told that, I don't know,\n   your dad's not coming back or your mom's not coming back. And it did happen\n   like that. Unfortunately, my father was working and he was raided. So he\n   got taken away and then when I came back home one day from school, my mom\n   told me. It was really hard.\n \n \n  "
