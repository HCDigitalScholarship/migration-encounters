Right now, she's manager of a\n   restaurant. She's the manager but she did a lot of work. She was never\n   around the house because she has to work a lot. She was always saying that,\n   \"If I came to America it's to get you in school, and to always have money\n   so we don't end back in Mexico.\" That was her idea.\n \n \n   Anne: So, then you became the mother of your brother?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, kind of. I was always taking care of him. I teach him how to\n   cook, or how to make the stuff. Basically, I learn from my mom, but my\n   brother learn from me.\n \n \n  "
