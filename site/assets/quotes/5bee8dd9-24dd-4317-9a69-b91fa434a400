  "text":"is\n   there anything you feel like you want to share that you haven't gotten the\n   chance to share? Or any other things that you just want people to\n   understand?\n \n \n   Laila: Just mostly to have an open mind and an open heart to people that\n   don't have papers. Just because we don't have a paper to validate our\n   residency in the States doesn't mean we don't like being there, doesn't\n   mean we don't love the US. In my school we used to always pledge our\n   allegiance to the flag, you know? And a lot of people would be like, \"Well\n   you don't have papers, you're not from here so you shouldn't be doing\n   that.\" And it's like, no. I love being here, I love being in the US. I love\n   all the opportunities I have. It's just that one paper that I don't have.\n   So just to have them be a lot more open minded and open hearted to people\n   like that because, honestly, all those things that are said that Mexico\n   sends their worst, that's not true. I know a lot of people that were in my\n   high school that were actually getting to go on a foreign exchange student\n   to Japan and to other places because they were the top of the class or top\n   of the state. They were going to the best universities and they were all\n   immigrants. So just be a little more open minded to a lot of people like\n   that. And not just Mexican immigrants. Immigrants in general. A lot of\n   people fear immigrants from other places but it's like, no, you don't think\n   we go to the States with fear? You don't think we're scared of being there?\n   Honestly, we are. My parents went to the States without knowing one word of\n   English. So it's scary. It's scary on both sides but just be a little more\n   open to people like that. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
