So, I was like, \"Man,\n you are at your lowest point, but you could still do something if you want.\n You can become somebody if you want. Just like these guys created this\n amazing genre, you can be somebody if you really want.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: And so, it just gave me faith. I had low self-esteem.
