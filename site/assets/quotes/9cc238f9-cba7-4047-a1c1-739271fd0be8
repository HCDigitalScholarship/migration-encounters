  "text":"Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed\n   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't\n   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad\n   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or\n   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the\n   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't\n   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket\n   and go over there? I think about it in a different\u2014at the same time, I was\n   a little kid too\u2014I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because\n   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom\n   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and\n   I can't fly.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but\n   then it turned into anger. It was like, \"Man, why can't I?\" It was always\n   just that, \"Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't\n   born here, I can't fly?\" I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC\n   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, \"No, you're crazy, you can't go\n   alone.\" She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.\n \n \n  "
