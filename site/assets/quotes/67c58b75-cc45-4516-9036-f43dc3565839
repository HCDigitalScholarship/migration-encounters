  "text":"Rocio: In a month I already rent my own studio. I get my furniture. So I\n   was all set up in a month\u2014and of course I compare the payment here in\n   Mexico over there\u2014and I just stay, I mean without thinking, without\n   planning, I just stayed. After a year I came back because I wasn't sure if\n   I'm going to stay or not in the USA. And I started working again here and\n   when I was in the job, someone opened my purse and stole my wallet and I\n   arrived to work and I just saw it and I was like, \u201cNo, I don't like this\n   anymore so I'm going to come back to Palm Springs.\u201d And I did. And I stayed\n   for 18 years.\n \n \n  "
