  "text":"Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How\n   did you hang out with these people?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work\n   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and\n   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would\n   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.\n \n \n   Anita: What did you cook?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.\n   [grilled meat] I don\u2019t know if you know tripa [intestine]\n \n \n   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something\n   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole\n   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would\n   always be like, \"I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.\" He will\n   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my\n   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.\n \n \n   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No.\n \n \n   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.\n   Sometimes we would be like, \"Let's go out to eat.\" \"Yeah, let's go.\" He\n   would go, \"No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.\" I would be like,\n   \"Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.\" One thing he\n   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. We would make it\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: With chicken?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah, with chicken, and onions, and chipotle.\n \n \n  "
