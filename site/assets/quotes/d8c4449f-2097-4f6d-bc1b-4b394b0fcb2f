You've got to\n   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do\n   a voluntary departure and you go.\" At that time I felt like I wasn't any\n   good to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on my family.\" So I just\n   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran\n   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was\n   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I\n   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just\n   said, \"Screw it.\"\n \n \n  "
