  "text":"Josue: Oh, it was really stupid [Chuckle] Because I was driving my dad's\n   car, and I went to a friend\u2019s in downtown Seattle. Left the car parked in a\n   parking lot, and then I went to my friend's house, or whatever. I was\n   coming back and I didn't have my driver's license with me\u2014I forgot it that\n   day. And so, somebody I guess called the cops saying that maybe I looked\n   suspicious or something because the cops came, they got me, I didn't have\n   my ID, the car wasn't under my name. And so they said that they were\n   charging me with car prowling, which at the end they dropped everything\n   because that was not the case. And yeah, that's what happened. They took me\n   in.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, the police detained you?\n \n \n   Josue: Yeah, it was the cops. And so, they got me and then I spent a few\n   days in County. Ain't nobody told me anything. Like I would ask, like \u201cWhy\n   am I exactly here? Can I speak with somebody?\u201d And they kept on telling me,\n   like \u201cOh, you're going to get your hearing,\u201d whatever. But I never did. A\n   few days after that, ICE came and you know they start asking like, \u201cWhen\n   did you come in? What's your social security number?\u201d All those questions.\n   And then they left. A couple of days after that, they came back, but you\n   know already with the shackles and everything for a bunch of people. And\n   that's how they took us down to the detention center in Tacoma.\n \n \n   Sergio: What year was this, that that happened?\n \n \n   Josue: 13? 2013.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, you never actually went before a judge for this case that the\n   cop stopped you for?\n \n \n   Josue: Never. I had a persecutor right there when I had my hearing in ICE,\n   with a judge, cause I told her, she asked me, \u201cDo you want to fight the\n   case? You want to do something?\u201d I said, \u201cNo.\u201d And I told her I just want\n   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the\n   left, he was like, \u201cNo, like he has charges.\u201d They wanted to deport me,\n   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me \u2018cause I'm not going\n   back. But he said, like \u201cHe's got this, charges,\u201d whatever. I don't know\n   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with\n   anything \u2018cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained\n   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him\n   and the guy said, \u201cOkay, we're deferring the charges.\u201d That's just what he\n   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Sergio: That's wild.\n \n \n   Josue: It was.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, they just looked at you and they were like, \u201cOkay, we're\n   dropping everything?\u201d\n \n \n   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The persecutor just said, he used that term,\n   \u201cWe're not dropping the charges, we're deferring the charges,\u201d something\n   like that. She said, \u201cOkay,\u201d signed it. And that's how I got the voluntary\n   one.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, were you informed of your rights during this process?\n \n \n   Josue: No, I would say no. No because whenever I explained it to the judge,\n   I told her like, \u201cWhenever I was in county, nobody ever told me anything. I\n   didn't know anything of whether we're charging me with. Whenever ICE came,\n   same thing. They just took me and didn't say anything.\u201d\n \n \n   Sergio: Did you have a lawyer helping you through it?\n \n \n   Josue: No, no. \u2018Cause like I said, I didn't want to fight anything.\n \n \n   Sergio: So you weren\u2019t provided with legal assistance?\n \n \n   Josue: No.\n \n \n  "
