I have time to be with my kids a lot because I worked nine to\n   four, so I have all afternoon with my kids. I was able go to the beach. As\n   you know, Palm Springs is very close to the beach, the snow, and mountains.\n   So I love the USA. I just love that place. So I hope\u2014I mean it's not going\n   to be the same of course, but it's different. I just always love to be\n   there.\n \n \n  "
