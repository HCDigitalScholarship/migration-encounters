  "text":"Roberto: And well you know I'll give it another try. I would like to go to\n   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to\n   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is\n   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If\n   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in\n   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,\n   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think\n   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful\n   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's\n   what I always think.\n \n \n  "
