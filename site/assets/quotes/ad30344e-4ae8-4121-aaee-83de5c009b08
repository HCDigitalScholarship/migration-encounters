But the way I look\n   at it, we're all borrowed in this life. We're just born one time. We're\n   going to die at the end of the day. I told my mama that one time, I'm like,\n   \"Mom, I'm borrowed. At the end of the day, I'm really not even yours. I was\n   born, you take care of me 18 years, and I'm gone on my own. At the end of\n   the day, that\u2019s what\u2019s going to happen. Everybody continues with their own\n   life. At the end of the day, you're going to die some day. My life is going\n   to continue. My brother's life is going to continue. Everybody's going life\n   continue. Why cry? Why suffer? What's the point of it?\"\n \n \n  "
