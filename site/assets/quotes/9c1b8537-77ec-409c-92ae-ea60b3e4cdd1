  "text":"And we lived in\n   Oregon, the rest of the time in Portland, Oregon and there, I went to\n   school, I went to elementary school in grade elementary school, I loved it.\n   It\u2019s called the Ventura Park Elementary School. It was great. A lot of\n   great teachers. I remember one teacher in particular, Miss Gilmore, she was\n   always like, even when I went to middle school, she was always there. I\n   would run into her even in the streets, and it was really rare to run into\n   one of your teachers. But when I did, and she would see me, and she would\n   get really happy. And she would always tell me, \"You're a great leader,\n   you're very smart, use that for something good, you know?\" And I always had\n   that in mind. And that was pretty much always my intention, I don't know if\n   I started going off a little bit off track during middle school\n \n \n  "
