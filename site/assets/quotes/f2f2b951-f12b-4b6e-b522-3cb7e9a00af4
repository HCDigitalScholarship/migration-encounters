Instead\n of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.\n      \n      \n Anne: People can come and go.\n      \n      \n Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of\n somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could\n pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the\n US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do\n that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private\n business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to\n pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].\n      \n      \n"
