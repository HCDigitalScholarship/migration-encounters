  "text":"Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, \"Mom, you're not going\n   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to\n   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.\" It was a\n   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that\n   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't\n   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to\n   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like\n   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they\n   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, \"You\n   don't come from the States.\" Like, \"Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I\n   do come from the States. I basically come from there.\" Like, \"No, you\n   don't. You're just a Oaxaque\u00f1a.\" Start calling me names again, \"You're\n   brown. You're short. You're skinny.\"\n \n \n   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.\n   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a\n   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if\n   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so\n   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my\n   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come\n   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, \"Okay. Just give it\n   back.\" Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start\n   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad\n   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't\n   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and\n   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting\n   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and\n   this girl started punching me. So I was like, \"Hey, I need to protect\n   myself now.\" So I did, and I got expelled because of that.\n \n \n  "
