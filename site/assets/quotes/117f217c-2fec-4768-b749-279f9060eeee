  "text":"Well, January 6 is the Dia de los Santos Reyes Magos, so of course I wanted\n   my toys. Then fourth of July was more like everybody doing firecrackers and\n   of course I wanted to do that, too. When it was Dia de los Muertos, we\n   celebrated a little bit different because we put an altar and we celebrate\n   all our people who have passed away. Then the day before was Halloween, so\n   we could dress up as whatever we wanted. Obviously, Christmas is both, but\n   we mixed it because in the Mexican culture the Christmas is not only giving\n   gifts, it's also doing, I don't know how you call them, when you go out and\n   you sing songs, Christian songs-\n \n \n  "
