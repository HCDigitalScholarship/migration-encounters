  "text":"Isabel: And you said you became a chef\u2014you started at Applebee's\u2014can you\n tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving\n around from there?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction\n and so after a few years he got tired of that physically\u2014it was very\n physically demanding\u2014so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,\n he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me\n along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to\n want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and\n literally just because I had his last name, it was, \"Okay, you got the\n job.\" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would\n call him offering jobs or\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, \"Okay, I might not be able to go\n to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own\n kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant.\" And so being\n under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were\n points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son\n anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be\n like, \"Yeah, I know who you are.\" At first it was all like, \"Okay, who are\n you?\" \u201cWell, I'm ____ son.\u201d \u201cOh wow. Okay, well here you go.\u201d But then\n after a while it was, \"Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you\n and we need you to pick our store back up.\" And so after that, that was my\n goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.\n      \n      \n Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?\n      \n      \n Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just\n because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me\n learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,\n that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?\n      \n      \n Angelo: [Affirmative noise].\n      \n      \n Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going\u2026Start\n pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your\n father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had\n to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?\n Were you together?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had\n legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a\n little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point\n where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,\n so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many\n times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age\n of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.\n And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, \u201cI\n could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a\n father.\u201d\n      \n      \n Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'\n house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got\n my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to\n support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.\n So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something\n bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It\n was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make\n it.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you\n were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security\n cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than\n what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,\n or anything like that.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there\n know that you were undocumented or that are younger?\n      \n      \n Angelo: No.\n      \n      \n Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?\n      \n      \n Angelo: 16.\n      \n      \n Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I\n Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].\n      \n      \n Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,\n and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know\n you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you\n work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the\n other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Oh very.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Very much like more high end?\n      \n      \n Angelo: [Affirmative noise].\n      \n      \n Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span\u2026still so incredibly\n young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Isabel: That's enough credit.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would\n get called in from other stores and they would tell me, \u201cLeave where you're\n at and we'll give you $3 more.\u201d Literally, I've never made minimum wage.\n And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The\n reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,\n and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also\n be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all\n like, \"Okay, so who's in charge?\"\n      \n      \n Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.\n      \n      \n Angelo: So that's when I said, \"Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to\n do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it\n and I got my name out there.\n      \n      \n"
