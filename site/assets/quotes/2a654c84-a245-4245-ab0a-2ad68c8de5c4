My parents don't send me any money right now, since they're\n   dealing with their own problems and I don't ask for anything, I feel like\n   it's more of a struggle. I see my own grandparents struggling and I feel\n   like I have to support them. I would always wonder when I was younger --\n   I'd be like, \"Why do Hispanics all live together? Like grandparents, kids,\n   grandkids?\u201d But I understand now. It's not because they want to, it's\n   because of economic reasons, because if you get seven thousand pesos, which\n   is like three hundred dollars a month, you really can't afford anything,\n   and when the houses here are over three to six million pesos, which is like\n   six hundred thousand dollars, you can't really afford to live anywhere.\n \n \n  "
