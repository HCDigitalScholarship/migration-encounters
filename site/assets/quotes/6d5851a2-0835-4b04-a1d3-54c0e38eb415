  "text":"Ben: The business started blossoming when we were in Texas. I had told\n my wife to give me\u2026Within five years we'll have a house and we'll both have\n good vehicles, dependable vehicles, but it's going to take a while. Well\n within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and\n we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I\n took a project on in Akron, Ohio. And when I took that project on, I did\n not want to go up there for many reasons. One, because I had this\n immigration issue on me and I'm going near the Canadian border. Another, I\n didn't really want to be away from my family.\n      \n      \n Ben: But when these customers get persistent, \"What's it going to take?\n What's it going to take?\" And I said, \"It's just out of the question. I\n can't go up there, I got all these jobs going on. Plus, I got bad\n equipment, my equipment\u2019s old and if my equipment breaks down up there, I'm\n not going to be able to meet the schedules and we're all going to be in\n trouble.\u201d \"Is that it? Really?\" The last price he had upped the price of\n what the contract was to pay, and the pay was fine. I had other reasons why\n I didn't want to go. Well when he says, \"I'll throw in a brand-new texture\n machine on top of it, but I'll sign off on the paperwork after you complete\n the project.\u201d And I go, \"You'll do that?\" \"I'll do that and when have you\n known me to not keep my word?\" And I go, \"Done deal.\u201d\n      \n      \n Ben: One of those texture machines, the price tag at that time was\n about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're\n talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got\n up to Akron though, they had projects, there were projects everywhere,\n Kentucky, Michigan. And the pay, the pay was awesome. And that is where it\n really, within I think about the second month that I was up north, it just\n completely changed.\n      \n      \n Ben: But I hadn't seen my wife and children since I had taken off up\n there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with\n her. I go, \"Look these other jobs,\u201d and I had already said I was going to\n take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, \"What if you\n go to be traveling?\" I go, \"It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,\n but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take\n the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together\".\n      \n      \n Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in\n Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a\n bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.\n And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of\n apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,\n but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.\n      \n      \n"
