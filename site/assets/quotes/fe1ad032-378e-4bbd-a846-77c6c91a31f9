  "text":"Is there anything that you wish just average American people\n   understood about migrant families?\n \n \n   Laila: What I would personally like them to understand is, we're not bad\n   people. I mean, a lot of people do bad things, yeah. But it's not because\n   we're immigrant. Everybody chooses what to do. They choose their own path.\n   A lot of immigrant families, like I mentioned, go for a better future for\n   their children and for themselves. A lot of them leave their home countries\n   not because they want to, but because they have to because of violence,\n   because of war, because of a lot of things. A lot of people in the US think\n   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they\n   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think\n   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting\n   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to\n   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed\n   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He\n   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside\n   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out\n   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, \"Get\n   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck\" at gunpoint. And he\n   was like, \"Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my\n   kids are in the car.\" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in\n   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I\n   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he\n   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I'm so sorry.\n \n \n   Laila: So yeah, my cousins had to grow up without their father. It was very\n   difficult. And I wish a lot of families in the US would just think about\n   it. What it would be like to go through something like that. It's not easy.\n \n \n  "
