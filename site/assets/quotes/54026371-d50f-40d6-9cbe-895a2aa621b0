  "text":"Jeimmy: American people are more like anti-violence, I guess. Like if your\n   kid comes to you and they tell you that they're being bullied, you would go\n   directly to the principal and you would speak with the principal, right? So\n   it's like, \"Okay, my kid's being bullied in your school, what are you going\n   to do about it?\" And the director would try to find a solution or what so\n   on. And here in Mexico, if you go and tell, \"les van haciendo burla a tu\n   hijo\u201d [they are teasing/picking on your son] he would be like, \"Okay, well,\n   I can't do anything about it. I can\u2019t be just behind your kid all day.\" So\n   what happened here in Mexico would be like, \u201cmira mi amor si te pega,\n   [listen my love if they hit you] you better whoop their butt. Because if\n   not, coming home, I'm going to whoop your butt.\u201d So that would be like the\n   Mexican part. So yeah, I guess I would get like on both sides.\n \n \n  "
