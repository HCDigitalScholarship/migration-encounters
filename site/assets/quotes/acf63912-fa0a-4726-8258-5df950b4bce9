  "text":"Olimpya: Growing up in the USA was awesome. [Laughs]. Yeah, it was the best\n   years of my life. Right now, I can sit down and think about it. I was\n   happy. That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family\n   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that\n   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she\n   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,\n   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it\n   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was\n   just great. We enjoyed life more than here. You have to work, and work, and\n   work. You're never going to get what you're looking for.\n \n \n  "
