  "text":"Many: Yeah, because I didn't have anything, no papers, nothing to work\n   with. So it was the only job available by that time. It was the only time.\n   When my mom knew about the surgery and everything, they were telling me\n   that they want to come back to take care of me. But I used to tell them no\n   because they already have a life in the States. So if they come back here,\n   they're going to start all over again like me. So it was going to be very\n   difficult for her too to start all over again. So, I told my mom, \"Just\n   stay there. Don't worry about me. I'm going to be okay. I just got out of\n   the hospital and the doctor told me that everything is okay.\" Because they\n   was asking these... Well, there was questions about, if I hear good, if I\n   can talk correctly, if I can move my hand, my face and everything. When I\n   passed the test he say, \"Okay, well, you ready to go.\"\n \n \n  "
