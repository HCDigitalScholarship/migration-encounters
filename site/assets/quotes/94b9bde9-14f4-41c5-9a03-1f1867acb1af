Me and my sister.\n   Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: Was it hard to leave them?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah. They were really strict. They were the types of people that\n   you couldn't put... if you were eating at the table, you couldn't put your\n   elbows on the table. You couldn't speak at the table. They'd wake you up at\n   4:30 in the morning so you can shower.\n \n \n   Ruben: But I mean they treat us good."
