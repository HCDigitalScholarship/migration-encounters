  "text":"Lizzy: As a child, when you were in the States, or as a teenager too, do\n   you remember what did you want to be when you grew up?\n \n \n   Laila: I wanted to be a marine biologist. I actually went to a high school\n   where they had that program. They had marine biology there, so it was\n   pretty cool. We had a lot of fish tanks and we were able to see a lot of\n   things. Our school offered scuba diving lessons for free, they would take\n   us to the Catalina Islands to scuba dive in California. But I wasn't able\n   to fulfill that dream of going to the Catalina Islands because of the\n   deportation of my dad and all of that. But yeah, I vividly remember I\n   wanted to be a marine biologist since I was very small.\n \n \n   Lizzy: If your dad hadn't been deported and you had stayed in the States,\n   do you think you would have continued down that path?\n \n \n   Laila: Completely. Yeah. I actually wanted to finish high school and go to\n   UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]. I think they had a marine\n   biology program there, and I wanted to go to UCLA. I had already told my\n   parents, and they were like, \"You're crazy. You're going to go to\n   California by yourself. Like, what are you going to do there?\"\n \n \n   Laila: And it's like, I don't know, but I want to be there. I want to do\n   that for a living. I love the ocean, I completely love all of that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I do too [Laila laughs], it's one of my big passions too, I get\n   that. Yeah.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, so I had already had something planned out you could say. But\n   life just comes at you in a different way. So I couldn't finish that. I\n   looked for a program here in Mexico, but they were all in the Canc\u00fan area,\n   the beach areas, and very expensive. So I had to put it, a complete stop on\n   that dream and just, I guess, grow up [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
