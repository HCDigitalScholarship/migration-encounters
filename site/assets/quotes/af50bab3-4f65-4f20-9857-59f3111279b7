  "text":"Rodolfo: And I feel like somebody's first experience or first impression or\n   how they've gone about being in Mexico has to do greatly with their support\n   system in Mexico. And unfortunately, I had the shorter end of the stick. I\n   felt like I needed to pass by the things I needed to pass in order for me\n   to get to the point where I am right now in this very point in time, in\n   this chair, wearing these clothes.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: It wasn't the most prettiest thing. I was homeless for a while. I\n   didn't have a house. My house was a 2016 Nissan Versa and that's only\n   because I took a job as an Uber driver and it wasn't even my car, it was\n   somebody else's. But I couldn't tell that guy it wasn't my car because he\n   probably wouldn't even have let me keep driving. So, my first, my initial\n   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every\n   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by\n   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I\n   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should\n   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.\n \n \n  "
