  "text":"Mike: Because this is the reason that I moved, my dad was telling me that\n   rent was one thing, but he was just telling the landlord that he knew to\n   charge me extra. He was telling me it was 3,500, but the landlord was\n   keeping 2,500 and giving him 1,000 of it. And I had found out, because the\n   own landlord lady told me, and I had to move and I had to lose my job.\n \n \n  "
