  "text":"Zayuri: There was a girl. She was around four years old. And there was the\n   boy. He was around eight or something like that? But they were really calm,\n   and they were chiller than my brothers. Sometimes I was like, \"You guys\n   need me to babysit?\" \"No, we're okay right now.\" \"Are you guys sure?\n   Because I could go there. I know that I'm like 40 minutes away from you,\n   but I could go. Really. You just hit me up if you need more.\" And 10\n   minutes later, \"Are you sure that you don't need me today?\" [Loud voice].\n   Because my brothers, they're not annoying, but they're very loud,\n   especially when they're together. So, I was like, \"Yeah, I need to get away\n   from here.\"\n \n \n  "
