  "text":"Erik: Because right here in Mexico, you can have a degree, you can have an\n   education, but you don't get paid for. I used to make the same kind of\n   money being just a laborer or working in a factory. You know? And it's not\n   that I don't like to be a psychologist, it's just that economics is a big\n   motivation to keep studying. You know what I mean? And well, I don't\n   volunteer, but I've been working a lot of psychology issues like assisting\n   people working on rehab centers. Like, NA, Narcotics Anonymous. And being\n   listen their problems, and talking to them, and tell them how I left the\n   drug issues and all that. So I just get tired of psychology, you know?\n   [Laughs].\n \n \n  "
