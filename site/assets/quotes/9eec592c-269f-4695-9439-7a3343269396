  "text":"Ruben: Yeah. And it was just something really, really, really for us,\n   scary. We had just got to LA, from San Diego so basically we tried to\n   understand the situation. We didn't really know what was going on. We just\n   knew it was in between cops and African American people. So it was\n   difficult for us to go to school because we figured they either going to\n   get us on the way or on the way back. You can hear people saying, \"Go get\n   food because there's not going to be no food for a long time.\" We actually\n   never really went into no store, nothing. We just waited until it was over.\n   Find out what was going on. A lot of people would say, \"Stay inside.\" You\n   see cars crashing into the gates of stores, just to get them open. Payless\n   Shoes, I remember we had a Payless Shoes and they lit it up on fire. So it\n   looked like a big ball of fire.\n \n \n  "
