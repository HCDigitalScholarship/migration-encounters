I always\n liked what I saw between my mom and my stepdad, and I always wanted a\n family. At this point, I got three babies with three different moms, and my\n mom tells me, \"You need to stop.\" I'm like, \"I'm just trying to have my\n family.\" She's like, \"You have a family.\" I was like, \"Yeah, but I want\n that family like you and my dad had.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: And that's always been my dream, to have my... I don't want fancy\n stuff, I don't want to be rich, I don't want to be famous, none of that. I\n just want to be able to have a family of my own. Be able to live with them,\n be with them, actually see my kids grow up, see them become the young man\n that they're going to be, the older man that they're going to be, instead\n of just having to talk to them over the phone.\n      \n      \n"
