  "text":"Donovan: I never felt like I didn't have papers. I'm very easy to get along\n   with, I make a lot of friends. My word of mouth, it's\u2026 I almost never\n   stutter. I'm a very good person. My mom never even told me that I never had\n   papers, until I got a little bit older in age. But it was frustrating that\n   I'm not able to unravel my full potential. I had a lot of scholarships that\n   got shot down, because of my status.\n \n \n   Donovan: They disqualified me for a lot of scholarships, because of my\n   status, so it's frustrating. Then you have my sister on the other side\n   who's only three years younger than me and she's officially a lawyer,\n   immigration lawyer, in San Francisco. She just passed the state bar exam\n   three weeks ago.\n \n \n  "
