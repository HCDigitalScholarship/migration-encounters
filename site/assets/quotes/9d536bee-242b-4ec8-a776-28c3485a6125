  "text":"Anne: I was not present at your survey, so I don't know much about you. So\n   maybe we could just start by you telling me about the circumstances for\n   you, going to the US, how old you were, your first impressions, why you\n   went or your family went.\n \n \n   Mike: When I was really young, I had gotten accident that required surgery\n   and I needed to get that surgery done, so when I went to the hospital and\n   get it done there was actually a couple of people from a criminal\n   organization that were supposed to, I guess, kill somebody in there. I\n   remember this like it was yesterday. I had a little breathing mask on and\n   the doctor was telling me to breathe when he counted the eight, I could\n   just hear the gunshots.\n \n \n   Mike: And I remember waking up in a bus, because my mom had gone inside the\n   hospital, grabbed me and got on the bus. And I remember waking up kind of\n   like, \"Where am I?\" And she ended up telling me all that happened, because\n   of that we decided\u2014well, my mom decided\u2014that she wanted a better life for\n   us. So we ended up crossing the border to Arizona. It actually took us\n   three days.\n \n \n  "
