  "text":"Anita: And one question is do you think that the US government has\n   responsibility for Roddy?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: In some parts, I think, but they won't do anything. I mean, to be\n   really honest with you, they never going to do anything because they have\n   so many people over there. It's not just Americans. It's not Mexicans. It's\n   everybody. It's all the Latin people, all the people from Europe or from\n   Africa. There's a lot of immigrants from over there, and they, some of\n   them, they already born over there. So, they're Americans, too. They don't\n   even receive help.\n \n \n   Anita: But what about Roddy being here. What kind of responsibilities \u2013\n   What do you think the US government should do to help Roddy?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, what I would like is probably just to help him with medical.\n   That would be all. I mean, because over there, they give you that \u2013 How's\n   it called? That program that they give you meals and all that?\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: And they give you benefits. Well, for that, I mean, I work for it,\n   and we used to pay our own things with your own work. But, I mean, I\n   wouldn't ask for money. The only thing that I would ask is for medical\n   assistance for him.\n \n \n   Anita: What about for his school?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: And schooling. Yeah. And that's one of the things, too, because on\n   the future, one of the things that I want him sooner or later for him to go\n   back is because I want him to go to school over there.\n \n \n   Anita: He's got to learn English.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. So right now, my goal up to this point is I want him to go\n   to an English school, and that's my new goal. I won't be able to do it in\n   this month, but probably next month, he will start doing English. And not\n   because I don't want to. It's because we need money to do all the process,\n   too. I'm starting my track and probably not this paycheck, I can\u2019t do it,\n   but next paycheck, next month, I will be able to do it. And that's\n   something that I really want to do because, to be really honest, I probably\n   just want to stay probably right here one or two years more, and he may go\n   back. That's something that I have. I want him to go to high school over\n   there, just out of high school to go to college, so he could start the\n   school over there already.\n \n \n   Anita: And would his mother \u2013 could he live with his mother?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No. No. I grew up in California, and I got a lot of aunts for my\n   mom's side. So, they will be able to take care of him, and plus, that's my\n   other goal, too. For next years, I want to try to apply for my visa. I\n   mean, I don't have no bad records at all over there. I didn't do anything\n   wrong over there. I came over here to fix my papers. I have everything, but\n   it didn't happen. So, I never tried to come back illegally, so I want to go\n   and try to get my visa. If I get it, good. If not, I'm just going to wait\n   for him to get my papers fixed. So that's my dream. I wish it will be done,\n   but we will try.\n \n \n   Anita: Those are great dreams. That's great dreams. Let me stop "
