It's not going to be over\n   the river or anything like that. It's in the car.\" Well, that's why my mom\n   decided to say yes, because this is a better way to cross over. Then after\n   that we got over to Reynosa again, and I think we did cross over the\n   desert, yeah, the border. We were walking in the night, I remember. It was\n   really dark. We couldn't see anything. We were just waiting for this guy to\n   come over with a car to cross over.\n \n \n  "
