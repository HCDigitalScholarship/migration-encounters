  "text":"My mother, she had to cross\n   the bad way. She went through the desert, she went through the river. My\n   sisters and I, we went through the bridge, like the regular crossing, but\n   we used other people's papers. My middle sister, they cut her hair off\n   completely, and I had to call her Jose.\n \n \n   Luisa: She had short, short hair. My sister's hair was up to her waist, and\n   my mom just shaved it off and her name was Jose now, and it was a game. I\n   didn't know what was happening, of course."
