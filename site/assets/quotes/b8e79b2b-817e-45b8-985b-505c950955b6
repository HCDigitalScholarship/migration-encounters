And what's one of your first memories in the US?\n \n \n   Roberto: My first memories hmm\u2026well, I don't know the place, every time\n   that I try to picture United States, I picture like the streets, the\n   places, the cars, everything, like most the streets, clean, I don't know,\n   clean. That's how I picture the States.\n \n \n   Sergio: Do you have like a memory that really sticks out, that you feel\n   like this is America?
