  "text":"In my\n   house we spoke Spanish all the time because of my mom. To this day, she\n   doesn't want to learn English even though we tell her to learn English. My\n   little sister, she doesn't speak Spanish, she speaks more English and with\n   her it's different. We tell her, \"You have to learn Spanish because it's\n   going to help you,\" but she doesn't want to learn.\n \n \n   Anne: Is she a citizen?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes, she was born in the US. So my parents didn't really adapt to the\n   American culture. They always wanted to follow Mexican traditions, even\n   when it's Mother's Day over there \u2026 I think here it's May 10th but over\n   there, when is Mother's Day?\n \n \n   Anne: I think it's the second Sunday of May, so it could be different days.\n \n \n   Juan: We could take that as an example. They'd rather follow Mother's Day\n   here in Mexico than over there. Also Christmas, I guess the one thing they\n   did adapt to was Thanksgiving. We don't celebrate that here in Mexico, but\n   they do celebrate there, and they did adapt that. Another thing, Easter\n   day. You go out with your family, you hide the eggs as a tradition, no?\n   They adapted to that, but here in Mexico they don't do that. They don't\n   even know about that. In a way they wanted to keep their Mexican culture\n   alive even though they were in the US, but they also wanted to adapt to the\n   things that they did there.\n \n \n  "
