There's a lot more educated people than me without jobs here in\n Mexico\u2014that\u2019s the only thing they don't have, English\u2014and I might get paid\n twice as much. And that's all the friends that I've made through the call\n centers through English, bilingual jobs. I\u2019ve been very fortunate because\n it's people that I can talk to in Spanglish with each other and that\n understand me culturally, which is another thing.\n      \n      \n"
