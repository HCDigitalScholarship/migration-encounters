  "text":"esus: The thing about government is, we're never going to be able to\n control it. It's only 1% that controls that system. So, trying to change\n the government is going to be the hardest thing to do. I'm guessing it's\n more like changing yourselves, changing the people, because the people are\n the majority of the people that live in the United States. So maybe just\n changing off from that racism and that stereotypes and all that, and going\n a different way, taking a different look at life where we're just humans.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So, try to change people's attitudes?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. We should all just have a chance to do something. Maybe that\n will make the best out of everybody.\n      \n      \n"
