  "text":"Mike: That was my mentality. When I shouldn't have thought like that, I\n   should have been thinking like, \"You're not from here. You got to watch\n   out. You need to get something going on because, you got another life that\n   depends on you.\" But it was crazy, because it's a mood swing. It's like you\n   want to do good, not just for yourself, but for your family, but at the\n   same time you're just like rebelling because you didn't get to live the\n   things that you did.\n \n \n   Mike: So it's like you know you're supposed to do this, but you're like,\n   Ah, whatever. And then you just end up doing that. But then when you do it,\n   you're like, \"Damn, why did I do it?\" You just reflect back on it. And it\n   was always a freaking struggle in my head man. Just trying to do the right\n   thing, because I felt like the world owed me all the time I lost. You know\n   what I mean?\n \n \n  "
