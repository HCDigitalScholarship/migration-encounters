  "text":"Anne: Did you have trouble with drugs?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. Marijuana. I feel like some people don't classify it as a drug,\n   but at the same time, when you're depressed or when you're going through\n   stuff, it really affects you. It affects every decision that you make. And,\n   of course, everybody\u2014I've tried drugs, I'm not going to say exactly which\n   one, but I've experimented.\n \n \n   Mike: I've never really liked it though. I don't like to be high because I\n   used to fight a lot. I would always see that when I would smoke, I would\n   always get beat up."
