  "text":"Erik: To erase co-dependency, basically, everything starts over when you\n   start to take care of yourself. So, whenever I take care of myself,\n   everything around me is fine. I don't know if that makes sense.\n \n \n   Anita: I do get it. It makes a lot of sense.\n \n \n   Erik: It makes sense what I think. The best value to me is take care of\n   myself. If I want to do a contribution to my city, I need to start for\n   myself. Keep my room clean. Keep my bathroom clean. Keep my house clean. Do\n   not throw trash on the street. Be responsible in my job. Pay my bills.\n   Besides contribute, do not be a load, or do not be a charge.\n \n \n  "
