  "text":"Yair: We didn't have nothing to eat. This guy really\u2026 he was not really\n   polite to us and stuff most of the time, because we didn't have nothing to\n   eat. My mom was just trying to see what work ... just to see if she could\n   feed us, because she didn't have no money. My dad told her to send the\n   location where we were at. I guess my dad was sending my mom money, so that\n   way we can eat because this guy didn't give us nothing to eat or something,\n   and my mom was getting really desperate. My mom was like, \"You know what?\n   I'm just going to go back to the city, because this guy is not treating us\n   right. He's not feeding us or anything like that, and the money that you're\n   sending to him, I don't know what he's doing with it. He's not giving us\n   nothing, and the kids needs clothes and stuff.\" That's when we decided to\n   just come back. My mom was like, \u201cNo, I'm never going to try this again.\n   I'm not going to risk my kids anymore,\" and this and that.\n \n \n  "
