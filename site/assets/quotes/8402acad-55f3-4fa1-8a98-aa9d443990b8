  "text":"Laila: They were super, super happy. He was actually the first generation\n   of our family to go to college. He wasn't able to finish because school was\n   very expensive, and he didn't have a scholarship so it was very difficult\n   for our parents. And as for my father got deported, well it was even more\n   difficult for him to continue studying.\n \n \n  "
