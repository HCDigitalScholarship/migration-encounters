I've always been very\n   mature, I've always been very aware of situations and what's going on, and\n   I could tell that they were having a really hard time. So, my dad leaves, I\n   stay with my mom and my brother, and yeah, it was hard because my mom\n   alone, and things like that. But when my dad saw that it would be better\n   for us to be over there, then I had no other option but to go with them.\n \n \n  "
