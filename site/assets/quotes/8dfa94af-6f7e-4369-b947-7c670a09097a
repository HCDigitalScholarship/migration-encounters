  "text":"Anne: I mean, the whole idea was you're going to come back and you're going\n   to try and continue your studies? So how did that go?\n \n \n   Laura: At first, it didn't go pretty well because my Spanish was horrible.\n   Right now, my English is horrible but later, back in the time, my Spanish\n   was horrible, so I had to learn. I save a lot of money to pay a school to\n   get regularization\u2014it was for learning how to write and how to speak\n   properly. So, I took that course. I tried to do my test for getting to the\n   UNAM (National Autonomous University of Mexico), but I couldn't. My Spanish\n   was still horrible. My reading was horrible. So, I had to adapt once again\n   to learn Spanish.\n \n \n   Anne: How long did that take?\n \n \n   Laura: That took about six months probably? Or one year because I have to\n   work, too. Here in Mexico, they do the test every six months, so I have to\n   wait until I have learned very well. So, when I learn, once again, I did\n   the test to get into the UNAM or to the Polit\u00e9cnico. I started on both\n   school but I went to the Polit\u00e9cnico to study nuclear physics.\n \n \n   Anne: To study\u2014\n \n \n   Laura: Nuclear physics.\n \n \n   Anne: And are you still doing that?\n \n \n   Laura: I have to finish my tests but I'm almost finished.\n \n \n   Anne: So, when did you start?\n \n \n   Laura: I started back in 2011, 2012? Don't remember pretty well. My mother\n   tried to help me with money, but sometimes it was not enough for me because\n   I have to pay my bills, and she didn't know about Mexico. She believes that\n   it's cheaper than in the US. It is kind of cheaper\u2014well it's not that much\n   cheaper. I have to pay my rent, my bills, and all of that. So, basically, I\n   started to work, and I study in the school as well.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you were doing part time?\n \n \n   Laura: Well, in that timeframe, I was doing part time. Right now, I work in\n   a full job.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you're trying to finish your undergraduate degree? Is that what\n   you're trying to finish right now?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, my undergraduate degree.\n \n \n   Anne: In nuclear physics.\n \n \n   Laura: In nuclear physics and I started that second career, economics.\n \n \n   Anne: A second\u2014\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, a second career on economics.\n \n \n   Anne: And so, when you graduate, you'll have a major in both?\n \n \n  "
