  "text":"Jesus: Yeah, because I mean, what I noticed in the States was you don't\n even know your neighbor at times. You don't even know the people that live\n two houses down. So how are you supposed to open up to somebody when you\n don't even know the person that lives next to you? Here, people know each\n other, so that forms a sense of community, I guess. You know your neighbors\n and everything. But over there, everybody is just in their own world.\n Everybody's stuck in their own thing, looking out for their own lives. You\n have to work for yourself. You've got to take care of yourself, and\n everything's more independent. But if you took a chance to get to know your\n neighbor and your other neighbor, they might be able to help you on things\n you might need help on. I think that's where you should start, just by\n getting to know your neighbor, getting to know the whole block and getting\n know the whole street, and then everybody just knows everybody, and it\n makes it safer.\n      \n      \n"
