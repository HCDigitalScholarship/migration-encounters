  "text":"Anne: Yeah. You were talking about drugs.\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah, drugs, man. It's just it didn't really get to me. But I\n   could see if I didn't have that motivation in myself, I could see how it\n   would be really easy to just go down a spiral and just drug binge. But\n   luckily thank God that that didn't happen to me. But weed I would usually\n   use it a lot, because it was my coping mechanism.\n \n \n   Mike: When you smoke, it makes you feel like nothing is important. All your\n   problems go away basically. And it was just like a coping mechanism to just\n   go on every day with my life. I felt like if I didn't have that, there was\n   no point. My life was whack.... There was one point in time that I had to\n   smoke before I do something fun.\n \n \n   Mike: It got to that point and it sucked, because I'm like, \"You had so\n   much energy. You did so many things and now it's like you got to smoke weed\n   to have fun.\" You know what I mean? But that's the only thing I had a\n   problem with. I've tried drugs, but it never really got something to where\n   I could say like, \"Dang bro, you're addicted. You need to stop.\"\n \n \n  "
