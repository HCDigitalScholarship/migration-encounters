But I'm very glad that people like you\n   are doing this because what I want is to be able to talk to more people, to\n   know what this is about. And it's just not because I went to United States\n   because I don't like Mexico or I come back and going to steal jobs because\n   I speak English because it's not that way. And the way we can help the\n   people that go through these situations and go to the government and ask\n   them\u2014I'm here for nine years and I can't get a job and I'm 55 or I need to\n   support myself. I need to support my kids. I need to live. I'm Mexican and\n   I am not able to do nothing if you're in my country and it's terrible. And\n   that's what I'm going to fight for now. Because if not, I don't know if I'm\n   going to survive or what am I going to do. My family is not going to be\n   there forever.\n \n \n  "
