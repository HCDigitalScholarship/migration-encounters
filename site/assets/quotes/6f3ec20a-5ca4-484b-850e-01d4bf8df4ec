  "text":"Anita: How did you cross the second time?\n \n \n   Joana: Basically, with fake documents. That was how because my mom didn't\n   want me to go through the normal way, I guess, of crossing the border. She\n   didn't want me to go through that because when I was five, she kind of knew\n   that my brain was going to block it and I wasn't going to be able to\n   remember, but when I was fourteen, there's no way for me to not remember\n   that. So, she tried to get the best thing that she could. She paid a lot of\n   money for it.\n \n \n   Anita: You got somebody's U.S. papers and you crossed by bus?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. That's exactly how.\n \n \n   Anita: There was no trouble?\n \n \n   Joana: No. There wasn't.\n \n \n  "
