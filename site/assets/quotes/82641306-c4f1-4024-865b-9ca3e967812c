  "text":"Anne: You enjoyed your life in Atlanta with the kids?\n \n \n   Many: Yeah. Everything was really nice. To live with my family, it was\n   really nice because I never had the experience before with my real family,\n   with my mom and my dad, with my brothers. So I tried to do my best in order\n   to give them what I didn't have at that time, when I was young. So I was\n   just trying to change the way I used to live. I was trying to give my kids\n   another life. I was just kind of patient with my family. I tried to work\n   every single day to provide my family with a good life. I tried to give\n   them a good education. I tried to give them nice advice to my kids, teach\n   them to be respectful with the rest of the people, especially with the\n   brothers, with their mom and everybody. When I remember this, when I start\n   talking about this, my mind just gets crazy, it starts going back. So yeah,\n   it was pretty cool to live with them. I lived with them for almost ten\n   years and then I got deported.\n \n \n  "
