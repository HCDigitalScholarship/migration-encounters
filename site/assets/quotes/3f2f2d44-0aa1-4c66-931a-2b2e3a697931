  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n     Remind me finally, where did you learn your English?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I learned English in California.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     How?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad\n     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was\n     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody\n     was like, \"The new guy\" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And\n     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL\n     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I\n     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had\n     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that\n     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was\n     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class\n     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling\n     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts\n     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. \"Huh?\n     Okay.\" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. \"Okay. I heard about him.\"\n     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, \"Blah, blah, blah,\n     blah, blah.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Okay and I understood \u201cAbraham Lincoln,\u201d and that\u2019s all. \"Abraham Lincoln.\"\n     \"Good. What about him?\" Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.\n     I was good at math because I learned \u2013here in Mexico, they're very good at\n     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher \u2013 It was a\n     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for\n     something and then the girl told me, \"Hey he's calling you. The teacher is\n     calling you.\" She said that in Spanish. \"Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?\n     What does he want me to do?\" \"He wants you to go to the board and complete\n     the mathematic there.\u201d\n \n \n    "
