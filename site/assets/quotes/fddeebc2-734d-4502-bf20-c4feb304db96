  "text":"Sergio: So, you were detained in the ICE facility or were you not?\n \n \n   Josue: Yes. Well I was in county first and that was in downtown _____, like\n   right on Fifth Avenue.\n \n \n   Sergio: How long were you in County?\n \n \n   Josue: It was just a few days, like maybe a week, 10 days.\n \n \n   Sergio: How did you feel there?\n \n \n   Josue: It was okay. I was in a different area where you really are like in\n   a fish tank \u2018cause it's all glass right here and the cops are right there\n   on like an island and they're literally just looking down at you. So it was\n   fine. I mean it was horrible \u2018cause it was county, but yeah, they didn't do\n   anything wrong.\n \n \n   Sergio: You didn't experience any abuse?\n \n \n   Josue: No, no. They had us, really just watching us right there. So no, it\n   was just the fact that nobody told me anything, they just kept on telling\n   me to wait, that somebody would tell me what was happening. And that never\n   happened.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, if you were detained, you were detained by ICE. How long did\n   ICE detain you for?\n \n \n   Josue: Oh, I was there for like two months minimum.\n \n \n   Sergio: Do you know where?\n \n \n   Josue: Tacoma, Washington.\n \n \n   Sergio: How'd they treat you there?\n \n \n   Josue: Oh no, that was fine. Yeah, yeah. I think that was fine.\n \n \n   Sergio: You ever have a bad experience?\n \n \n   Josue: No. Well the thing is they are not ICE. They're a private company. A\n   horrible part there was with ICE, whenever they actually get you to ICE.\n   So, bad experiences, it was with ICE, not with the police and not with the\n   other company. Yeah, it was with them.\n \n \n  "
