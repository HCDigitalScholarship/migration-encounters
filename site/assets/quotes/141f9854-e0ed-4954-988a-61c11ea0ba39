  "text":"Okay. My neighborhood had to respect it, and then their neighbor would have\n   to respect it. We will never do a meeting in either one of our\n   neighborhoods. We will always go to, I don't know if you guys ever heard,\n   in winter, there's a park called, well there's Whittier Narrows, but\n   there's another one where there's a Lake Santa Fe down. That's a big park\n   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.\n \n \n   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?\n \n \n   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of\n   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that\n   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never\n   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never\n   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the\n   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another\n   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,\n   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had\n   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at\n   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that\n   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we\n   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.\n \n \n  "
