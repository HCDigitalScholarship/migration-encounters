  "text":"Anita: Did you know that you were undocumented?\n \n \n   Joana: When I was small, no. Then when I got older, in my teenage years, I\n   did have the knowledge, but I was afraid and embarrassed for anyone to find\n   out. Especially in school [Chuckle]. But I didn't know that education wise,\n   they don't have a problem with it.\n \n \n   Anita: Why were you embarrassed about being undocumented?\n \n \n   Joana: I was embarrassed about being undocumented because I didn't want to\n   get bullied. I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been\n   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so\n   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.\n \n \n   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?\n \n \n   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone\n   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.\n   [Emotional].\n \n \n   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?\n \n \n   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to\n   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family\n   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.\n   It was extremely hard. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being\n   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.\n \n \n   Joana: Imagine\u2026 I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of\n   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do\n   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,\n   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone\n   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a\n   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That\n   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I\n   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to\n   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,\n   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's\n   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,\n   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.\n   It's extremely hard.\n \n \n  "
