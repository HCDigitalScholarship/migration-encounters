  "text":"Rodolfo: I think a lot of the deportees, when they come back, yes. But I\n   think more about their family\u2014the inability to help your family member, the\n   person who you love is one of the most horrible... it's a horrible feeling,\n   not being able to help, let alone help one of your family members.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I remember my mom crying over the phone and telling me, \u201cMan, I\n   just want to help you. I wish I could just go and get you.\u201c Or, \u201cMan, I'm\n   going to ask around and see if I can find a lawyer and everything.\u201d Oh my\n   god, don't let me get started on the lawyers over there. They're not quite\n   good people, right? Because they take advantage of that as well. But that's\n   another conversation.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, on that piece about helping families. What do you think the US\n   government can do to help Mexican deportees and the families that they\n   leave behind? You left your family.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: If it'd be up to me, everybody would be together and there would\n   be no borders and no laws. But what the US government can do to help\n   families in that position is if one of your family members is in a\n   detention center, you automatically\u2014 there should be a law, there should be\n   a rule, whatever man\u2014can go and visit. You can go visit and get visited by\n   anybody who they want and they can't touch them. It doesn't matter if it's\n   a federal, state law or whatever.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: You can't deprive somebody of their family like that, man. I\n   understand you're not from here, and okay, they're in deportation\n   proceedings and everything, but that's why there's so many fights in there,\n   you know? That's where there's so much aggression, so much tension, because\n   you don't know what's going to happen.\n \n \n  "
