  "text":"Ivan: Yeah. What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at\n   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.\n   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the\n   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd\n   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,\n   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.\n \n \n  "
