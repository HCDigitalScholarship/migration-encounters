  "text":"sabel: Yeah. No, I think that's really fair. A couple of closing\n   questions, you said both the US and the Mexico has contributed to your\n   identity and your mentalities. Do you feel Mexican or American?\n \n \n   Dan: On most times, American.\n \n \n   Isabel: Most times American. Why is that?\n \n \n   Dan: In the US, that's where I create my lifestyle. The point of view is\n   based of your lifestyle, who you hang out with, why you hang out with them,\n   what you're capable of doing for some people or some others, not. Over in\n   the States, I would have a weekend where I would go out, party with my wife\n   and the next day I will go to a very expensive restaurant and buy her a\n   bracelet or a necklace, earrings and spend my money with who I love\u2014my\n   family, my mom, my sisters. I would be very happy being in that restaurant\n   and everybody around the table and just take care of the tab and not worry\n   about it. I think that way. In here, in Mexico, even though that is a\n   little bit harder, I actually do the same thing. I hang out, I go out to\n   dance, I go to the karaokes. Back then, in the US, I would go to the lake,\n   do a barbecue. And here, I go to Acapulco. It's a lot better. I don't see\n   the negative things\u2014I mean, I don't always focus onto the negative things\n   because negative things will ruin your life. Focus in what you have, who\n   you are, what you're capable of doing, and what you're capable of helping\n   others about, with this, with that. If people see you as a valuable person\n   for the experience you have at this point, they're more than welcome to get\n   help from myself. But not a lot of people think the same way.\n \n \n  "
