  "text":"Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end\n   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't\n   get anything. In my mind I thought, \u201cMan, what's the point of really\n   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any\n   help?\u201d My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want\n   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she\n   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do\n   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her\n   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to\n   work that much. That's it.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, \"Well, okay, what's the point of\n   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my\n   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.\" Then the aspect of\n   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that."
