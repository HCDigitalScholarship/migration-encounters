The day I was supposed to learn\n   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then\n   [Chuckles] I sculpted something\u2014a huge tiger\u2014and I turned it in and it was\n   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one\n   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still\n   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.\n \n \n  "
