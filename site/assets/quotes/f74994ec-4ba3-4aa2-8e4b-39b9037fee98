  "text":"I loved school. My first years, elementary and junior high, I was in\na GATE program, gifted and talented education, I was pretty smart. I did\nreally good. When I started out hanging out with my friends, that's what\nmessed me up later on. And I didn't get in trouble a lot. I mean, I\u2019ve only\nbeen to jail three times. Except I did a lot of time for it. But I mean, I\nwasn't going in and out of jail. I wasn't going to the halls. I've never\nbeen to juvenile hall in my life. It wasn't until I was an adult that I\nstarted getting in trouble. I mean, I had a little bit of run-ins, but I\nnever did any time. I was pretty good. I was scared of my mom and dad, they\nwhooped me [Chuckles]. So I tried to do good to please them.\n      \n      "
