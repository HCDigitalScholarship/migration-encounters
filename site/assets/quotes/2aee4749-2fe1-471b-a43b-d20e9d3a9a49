  "text":"Laila: Well, mostly from my mom that she has actually told me most of what\n   happened. She says that the first couple of times we were detained, they\n   were just taken back and left at the border. Just go away, go home. There\n   was one time she was actually carrying me. She actually carried me the\n   whole time because I was three so and she says it was around rain time. The\n   shrubs were very tall and all the spines and all that. She didn't want me\n   to get injured, but she actually fell on a rock and got a hole in her knee\n   and she couldn't walk. When the border patrol saw that, they aided her and\n   they gave us water and they wanted to help her. They couldn't really give\n   her medical treatment, but they just helped her get back across the border.\n   She says that one of them told her to go home. Not risk her kids and there\n   was no reason for that. [Pause] There was no reason for that [Chuckle], but\n   I guess my mom says she's very stubborn. So she wanted to reunite her\n   family and we were able to cross on the fifth time [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow. Your mom sounds like a strong woman.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, she is. She is. She actually helped us a lot [Emotional].\n   Sorry.\n \n \n   Lizzy: It's okay.\n \n \n   Laila: [Starts crying] To get something better. [Pause] sorry.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You want me to pause to go get tissues?\n \n \n   Laila: Please.\n \n"
