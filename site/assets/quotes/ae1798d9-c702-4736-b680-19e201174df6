  "text":"Anita: So, what happened to you? How did you get stopped by the police?\n   What's the story?\n \n \n   Erik: I was on my AA meeting. I was on the work, and before work I have a\n   AA meeting, so I was driving without a seatbelt. I was pulled over by a\n   police officer, he asked me for my driver's license. I have driver's\n   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.\n   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the\n   law. So I have a driver's license from another state. For which, the police\n   officer is supposed to give me only a ticket at the most\u2014you go to the\n   court, the court told you no, you have a valid license, you don't have\n   this. But the police officers knew if he locked me down then they going to\n   interview me with an ICE officer. So he knew what he was doing. But, it\n   was, well, just driving without the seat belt.\n \n \n  "
