  "text":"Rocio: I was cleaning rooms. Something very different of course, because I\n   work here in an office and it was hard for me. But really it was the\n   difference in the salaries, that just made the difference you know. To have\n   my studio in a month and furniture and everything I hear is hard to do\n   that. So, and then I was by myself. I wasn't married, I didn't have kids, I\n   didn't even plan it, but I stay.\n \n \n  "
