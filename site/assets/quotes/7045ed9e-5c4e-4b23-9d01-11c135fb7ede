  "text":"dgar: But when the DACA DREAM Act, when I got the DACA, it really helped\n   me a lot. I could have got the license to drive but I don't know why I\n   didn't. I didn't do that, either.\n \n \n   Anne: So when did you apply for DACA? How old were you?\n \n \n   Edgar: I was like 15, 16. Around that time. Yeah. My mom actually told me\n   about it. And she told me I have to apply, that I couldn't let that\n   opportunity go.\n \n \n   Anne: Did your brother apply?\n \n \n   Edgar: I don't think... No, he didn't. He didn't apply. I don't know why.\n   Yeah. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: So you applied and you got your papers?\n \n \n   Edgar: Yeah. They gave me a meeting. I went there, got a passport, got my\n   social security. And, yeah. I got a job. I could do more stuff with it than\n   without it.\n \n \n   Anne: And you had to stay in school.\n \n \n   Edgar: I had to, yeah. I had to. I had to.\n \n \n   Anne: So did that give you any more incentive to stay in school or were you\n   still smoking weed?\n \n \n   Edgar: It did. But, no. I really didn't care either, though. I didn't renew\n   it, though. I had to renew it. I don't know how much they give you for\n   that, DACA?\n \n \n   Anne: Every two years.\n \n \n   Edgar: Every two? Yeah, I think I only had it for two years then. I didn't\n   renew it because I didn't go to school no more. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
