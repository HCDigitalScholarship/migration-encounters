He's the host,\n   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he\n   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry\u2014and in\n   English.\n \n \n   Luisa: He understood English and he would tear up with a lot of the stuff\n   that I would give him. Very, very understanding, but we bonded over\n   literature because he was extremely, extremely into books",
