  "text":"Anne: So I don't know if you follow what's going on in the US. There's a\n   law, that probably won\u2019t get passed in the Senate but just got passed in\n   the house, that basically says that if someone like you, graduates from\n   high school, or is on the way to graduating from high school and hasn't\n   gotten in trouble, you can get a conditional residence\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: Right.\n \n \n   Anne: And get a social security card for ten years. Ten years conditional\n   residence. And then if you get employed in three years during that time you\n   can get permanent legal access.\n \n \n   Mike: Oh, okay. So that was the Trump administration when they came to an\n   agreement, right?\n \n \n   Anne: No, they haven't reached an agreement, but it's this new dream. If\n   you had known that all you had to do was keep going to school and you could\n   get a social security card and you could have a path to citizenship, would\n   that have made a difference, do you think?\n \n \n   Mike: Yes. I feel like yes, if I would have known earlier. But at the same\n   time, once you start living in Arizona, or anywhere in the US, you kind of\n   start thinking like you're from there. I was telling the nice lady from\n   earlier, Anita, that once you get used to it, once you think that you're\n   from there\u2014that was my mistake, because I started not caring\u2014you just start\n   doing stuff that if you don't have papers you should know you're not\n   supposed to do. I got kind of carried away and was trying to get the whole\n   world. Because I didn't have my papers, I was trying to go after everybody.\n   I'm like, \"Okay. So if I can't work, cool, I'll just do my own thing, or\n   I'll just do this, do that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: I feel like if I was a little more informed, it would have gone a\n   different way, or a little more help, programs or anything. I feel like I\n   could have still had a fighting chance.\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah. I mean the hope is that there will be policy that will give\n   hope to people like you that as soon as you finish going to school, you can\n   then get a social security card, you can get a job, you can make a life for\n   yourself, but currently\u2014\n \n \n  "
