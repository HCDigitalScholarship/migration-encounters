Well, it was too big for us, you know?\n   Iguala is really small, our city was really small. Chicago is such a huge\n   city. The buildings are really amazing, so I remember that we were really\n   impressed. We couldn't believe that we were in the U.S.\n \n \n   Laura: So we went in the Chicago in October, so it was really beautiful\n   because the trees has those leaves color red, and some of the trees doesn't\n   have any leaves, so it was really cool.
