  "text":"Miguel: Yeah, it is difficult though. It really is. You're in that mind.\n   Like I'm 31 and I don't feel old, and I don't feel young. I feel like I'm\n   at a point where I need to hurry up and do something though. And it's\n   really hard to hurry up and do something out here when there's very little\n   for us to do. And you don't have very many opportunities. I would love to\n   have my own house out here and pay a mortgage and have a car payment and\n   have my son come home and be like, \"Dad, I love our car\u201d or \u201cdad, our house\n   looks nice\u201d or \u201cdad you got a good job,\" or things like that. And it's\n   impossible to really see that, to really visualize what I had over there.\n   Even where I live, people are like, \"Oh, you live in a nice area.\" I'm\n   like, \"I do live in a nice area, but my house is not nice.\" It's like it\n   might look nice and everything but where I live is not really, and they're\n   like \u201coh\u201d you know. But it is hard. It really is. It's really difficult,\n   it's frustrating, it's very stressful.\n \n \n   Miguel: I want to do more than just work. And I would like to, not own a\n   big business but own a little store or something. But it's hard. And\n   especially now, I think about it like I'm 31 will be 32 by the time I'm 40,\n   I try to focus more in the future and it's hard because then you're like,\n   \"Okay, but I got the path following me, I got to catch up and I got to\n   focus now and so,\" but I try. I really do try and that helps me a lot\n   talking to people and especially people that come from the States, like we\n   have a lot in common, just like the language itself helps us a lot.\n \n \n  "
