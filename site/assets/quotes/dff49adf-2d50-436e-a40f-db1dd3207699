  "text":"Sergio: After your mom told you couldn't go on that trip, how did that\n   affect the way you were involved in school, the things you wanted to do,\n   did that change? Is there anything that you...?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I didn't put as much effort as I did anymore. I knew, at the end\n   of the day, I'm not eligible for scholarships. I don't get any aid, I don't\n   get anything. In my mind I thought, \u201cMan, what's the point of really\n   working hard in school if at the end of the day, I'm not gonna get any\n   help?\u201d My mom is having to work to put me through college. No, I don't want\n   this, so I just thought, you know what, I'm just gonna give her what she\n   wants, my diploma, my high school diploma. From then on, if I want to do\n   something, it'll be by my own hand, out of my own pocket. I didn't want her\n   to... Not that I was a burden or anything, my objective was for her not to\n   work that much. That's it.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: After she told me that, I'm like, \"Well, okay, what's the point of\n   really working hard and putting your best effort into school if, in my\n   position, I won't be able to surpass US citizens.\" Then the aspect of\n   financial aid, or any aid at all, I'm not gonna have any of that. I tried\n   it with the fake social, but obviously it didn't go through. Nothing\n   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything\n   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of\n   the country, and I used to get invited and, \"No, I can't go man, my family\n   doesn't think...\" It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I\n   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my\n   family always told me, \"Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If\n   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away\n   from here, they can take us away from each other.\"\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and\n   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do\n   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in\n   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.\n \n \n   Sergio: What do you think you would have wanted or end up being before you\n   found out? What kind of things... Like you were on debate team that was\u2014\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I wanted to be a lawyer, man, that's what I wanted to be. That's\n   what I wanted to be, a lawyer. It's funny, because when I was younger I\n   wanted to be a lawyer. Then after that I'm like, \"I want to be an\n   immigration lawyer, that's what I want to be now. I want to be an\n   immigration lawyer.\u201d I was already on the right track to being a lawyer,\n   but then when that happened, it really opened my eyes more to, \"Okay, let's\n   help my people.\" I didn't realize... I know individuals over there who are\n   citizens, and they're panhandling because they want to. They're on their\n   own addiction or for whatever reason right? Or people who are just living\n   off the government, but then I see some of my family members, or my\n   friends\u2019 family members and they're not citizens but they have businesses.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: They have a business, they have trucks, they have houses, they're\n   great. They're not living off the Government, they're not asking for a\n   handout. They're living better than what a citizen is living. It's all\n   about how much work you put in, right? If you hang around people who don't\n   want to do anything, then you're not gonna do anything. I remember Gerald\n   Ford always told me that. He was like, \"If you want to be a millionaire,\n   hang around millionaires. If you want to be successful, hang around people\n   who do successful things, but if you want to keep doing what you're doing,\n   and just be a little caddie or whatever, stay here. Stay here and maybe one\n   day you'll do something else.\"\n \n \n   Rodolfo: He was very blunt in that aspect like, \"Always do a good job. I\n   don't care if you're a shit-shoveler, you're gonna be the best shit\n   shoveler there is.\u201d That always stuck to me, that's why whatever I do, it's\n   always been 100%.\n \n \n   Sergio: That's good.\n \n \n   Anita: Can I speak? I'm Anita, I'm the director of this project.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Okay.\n \n \n   Anita: I'm really pleased to meet you\u2014\n \n \n   Sergio: Likewise.\n \n \n   Anita: I'm amazed at your incredible story. When you talked about the trip\n   to DC, the debate club, and you got very sad\u2014\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: ... what made you sad, and did it make you feeling... Do you\n   remember what your feelings were as you sort of found that all these\n   options were gone to you?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Well, it was just mixed emotions. I felt sad because I contributed\n   to the team a lot. I wasn't just there, and it made me sad because I wasn't\n   going to be able be with my friends, my teammates. It also made me mad\n   because all my life, all my short period, my whole time here in Chicago or\n   whatever, I don't think I've done anything bad. Why shouldn't I have the\n   privilege to go if I put in the same work as they did? Only because I don't\n   have a social security number or a document that lets me buy a plane ticket\n   and go over there? I think about it in a different\u2014at the same time, I was\n   a little kid too\u2014I just cried a lot. That night I just cried a lot because\n   I knew I wasn't gonna go. My mom spoke to the, I'm not sure what my mom\n   told her, but see, I don't think she told her that we're undocumented, and\n   I can't fly.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, I just remember that night feeling very sad, very sad, but\n   then it turned into anger. It was like, \"Man, why can't I?\" It was always\n   just that, \"Why can't I? I put in the same work, and just because I wasn't\n   born here, I can't fly?\" I even looked into bus routes and everything to DC\n   and stuff like that, but my mom was like, \"No, you're crazy, you can't go\n   alone.\" She worked and everything, I just felt sad, mostly sad.\n \n \n  "
