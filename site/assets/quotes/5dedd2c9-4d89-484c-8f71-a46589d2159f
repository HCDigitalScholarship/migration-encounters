  "text":"I think in fourth grade was the first largest book\n   that I read. It was the Bram Stoker's Dracula, the big one. That was the\n   first biggest book that I read, and then I had an obsession with Roald\n   Dahl. Roald Dahl was my thing. I loved Roald Dahl. The BFG, the Twitches,\n   the Witches, all of it, I loved it. I loved it. I loved it. Matilda,\n   Matilda. Oh, my God. I loved Matilda. Roald Dahl was a huge thing -- as\n   well childrens\u2019 books -- but I was also reading adult books at the same\n   time. Around this time is when I started getting my obsession with the\n   Holocaust, with all this tragedy.\n \n \n  "
