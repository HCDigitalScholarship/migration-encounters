They have good quality, you know? Here in Mexico you can find\n   anything. You can find the same thing, but not as much good quality, or you\n   can, but it's really expensive. For example, for shoes, some Nike shoes, I\n   really like some Nike shoes. Nike shoes are like here they're 3,000 or\n   4,000 or 5,000 pesos.\n \n \n  "
