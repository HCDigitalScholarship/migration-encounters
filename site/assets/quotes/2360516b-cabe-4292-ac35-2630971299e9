They\n   needed like infinity of paperwork. And my dad's like, \"Okay. So me estas\n   diciendo que les estas negando los estudios a mi hijo por esto, esto y lo\n   otro,\u201d [you are denying my son his studies for this, that and the other]\n   And they're like, \"No, we're not denying him.\" -\"No entonces?.\"[no, so?]\n \n \n  "
