  "text":"Rodrigo: Because they live over there. To be honest with you, one of the\n   reasons that now I get it is because in Minnesota, they didn't have a lot\n   of Hispanic people. So, when you apply over there to get an\n   immigration\u2014because my aunts, they were trying to get the residential for\n   my uncles, for their husbands\u2014it was more faster for them to do it over\n   there. So, they moved over there. Then they started buying houses. That's\n   why we stayed there, for a while. Then they come back to California when\n   they get their papers, and some of my uncles, they stay in Minnesota, and\n   some, they stay in California.\n \n \n   Anita: Wow. So, was California better than Minnesota?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Pretty much, yes, and no.\n \n \n   Anita: Okay.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I have to be honest with you, in California, there were more Latin\n   people, more Hispanic people, more Mexicans. I will say that, where we\n   live. It was easier for me because they have more programs on the high\n   school to learn English. We have the ESL, ESL one, ESL two, ESL three. That\n   helped me a lot. It was better because I was used to being always at home\n   back in Minnesota, and over here, not, because it was more sunny. It was\n   better. It was more familiar with Mexico.\n \n \n  "
