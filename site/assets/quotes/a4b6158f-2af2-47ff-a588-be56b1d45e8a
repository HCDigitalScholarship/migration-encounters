  "text":"Tim: So, I'm just wondering, does anyone ... I assume most of these calls\n   are coming from the United States. Does anyone hear your accent and ever\n   attack you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Oh yeah, all of the time. That's in every call center here. I\n   mean, that happens all of the time, that when you talk to somebody, and\n   they say, \"Oh, I don't want to talk to you. I want someone from the United\n   States.\" The only thing that you control is, \"You know what? I'll transfer\n   you to the IVR\u2014\"\n \n \n   Anita: To the what?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: The IVR. \"But I won't promise you-\"\n \n \n   Anita: What's the IVR?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: When you call to customer service\u2014\n \n \n   Tim: An automated system.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. So that's when you will be like, \"You know what? Okay. I\n   will transfer you to the IVR, but I won't promise you that you will be\n   speaking with somebody from the United States.\" They will get upset and\n   they will hang up. Other than that, you will tell them, \"If you want to\n   talk with someone from the United States, you will have to go to the local\n   office to do the process because pretty much all of the call centers are\n   ... I mean, I'm working, right now, Alliance, I don't do any phone calls. I\n   don't receive phone calls, it's pretty much back office. It's kind of\n   different. But it's better, I think. It's less pay, but it's better.\n \n \n  "
