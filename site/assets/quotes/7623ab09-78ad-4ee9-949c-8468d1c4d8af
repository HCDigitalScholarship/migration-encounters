  "text":"Anne: And did your mom work too? Or just your dad?\n      \n      \n Ben: My mom, she worked quite a bit, but there was a period when my\n youngest sister was born, she ceased from working and she stayed home with\n her for a few years. And then once\u2014I think my sister was about four years\n old\u2014then she went back and started working again until we were doing good\n in the construction. When I jumped into the construction and started my own\n business, then my dad went to work for me. And when he went to work for me,\n then my mother didn't have to work any more. We were really doing pretty\n well, we did pretty well. Did a lot of construction projects all throughout\n the Midwest and eastern seaboard. Lot of government projects.\n      \n      \n Anne: Really?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. A lot of low-income housing for the government.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you moved around, it wasn't a local company that just stayed\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: I based my company in Indianapolis and the main reason that we\n ended up based in Indianapolis is that I had a project going on in Akron,\n Ohio, one in Indianapolis and then I had two coming up in the Kansas\n City\u2014in both-- Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas. And I knew it\n was going to be a lot of jumping around, and I figured well Indianapolis\n will be right in the center. So, I rented an apartment there for me and my\n wife and my son and my daughter; my son was a baby, but my daughter, she\n was like four years old, or three years old.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then right about after that, we bought a house. Well, no, my\n wife wanted to enroll my daughter in pre-K to get her going because her\n age. Her date of birth and the cut off with the school, they won't let her\n in for regular elementary school. So, she found this church and she told\n me, \"There's this church that's got pre-K and we're going to get her\n started there.\u201d And I go, \"Well okay, go ahead.\u201d So, we enrolled her there\n and we ended up getting involved with that church and we were the only\n Hispanics at the church at the time, whenever we did it. But they were good\n to us and they still attend there.\n      \n      \n Ben: That church, they started building one year on, every year they\n would add a year onto the school. And my daughter was one of the original\n students. So, she's one of the original students. The first original\n student to go all the way through the academy and graduate.\n      \n      \n Anne: What's it called?\n      \n      \n Ben: Cornerstone Baptist Academy in Indianapolis.\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n"
