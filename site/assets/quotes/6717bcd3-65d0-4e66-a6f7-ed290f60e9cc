  "text":"Jesus: Like I said, [Sigh], over here, and I hate to say this, it's like\n   law is lawless. Israel has brought this up before too. 1% of crimes get\n   solved here. The reality is, if a husband gets mad at their wife, whatever\n   amount of violence he brings onto her, chances are it's not going to get\n   resolved, and not quickly and it's not going to be fair way. So, I just\n   feel like\u2014oh wait, what was the question one more time? Sorry about that.\n \n \n   Anita: I was wondering whether women are more jealous or possessive here\n   than in the States?\n \n \n   Jesus: Yeah. So, I feel like up in the States because the laws are more\n   fair, if you hit a woman up in the States, the law's going to come down on\n   you. Regardless of whether or not you actually did hit them, or didn't, the\n   law's going to come down, and it's going to take it down on the man\n   whatever way possible. And so, women over there are more willing to be\n   like, \"Hey, you know what? You're messing around with this other girl. I'll\n   go mess around with someone else.\" So, it's safer for them. They can go out\n   to the club and be like, \"This guy, he doesn't mean this. So, I'm going to\n   go out with my girls, hook up with another dude.\u201d Over here, if they try\n   and do that, sometimes you get the issue of where the guy gets jealous and\n   like I said, the crimes don't get solved here very quick, so...\n \n \n  "
