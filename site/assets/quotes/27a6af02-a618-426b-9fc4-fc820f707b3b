So I ended up just saying, \"I'm going\n   back out to Mexico to live this time and actually live out here.\" I ended\n   up just coming back, and just forgetting about college over there, and came\n   back here to Mexico to actually live. And of course I was actually helping\n   my mom with the cancer thing.\n \n \n  "
