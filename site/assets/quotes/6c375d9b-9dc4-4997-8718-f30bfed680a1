  "text":"[51:59] Then as I got older, maybe in my mid 20s or early on, when I was\n   25, I learned that I had nothing to do with it. It was their choice.\n   Recently, my mom came to visit here, and it was amazing because once again\n   my whole family was sitting down at a table eating together. My mom has a\n   boyfriend, my dad has a girlfriend, so I guess they put those issues aside\n   as, \"Hey now, we're still family. It doesn't matter who's next to us. We're\n   always going to be a family.\" This happened last month.\n \n \n  "
