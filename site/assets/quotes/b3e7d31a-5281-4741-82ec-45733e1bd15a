  "text":"Dan: Well, when I crossed the border the last time, that was back in 2009.\n   I was married already and I had my child. My wife was pregnant with my\n   daughter. The violence and the economic situation here was to a point that\n   it was not standable no more. My dad came over. He was an American citizen\n   by then, and he drove us to the border. And I crossed the border in an\n   automobile with my sister and my nephews. And just the officer were like,\n   \"You American citizen?\" \"Yes, I am.\" \"Where were you born?\" \"Dallas,\n   Texas.\" And he says, \"What hospital?\" \"Parkland.\" And said, \"Okay. Go, go,\n   go.\" They didn't check anything, and that was after 9/11, which the\n   security shouldn't be a little tighter? And then my wife came across the\n   border with my father and they didn't have any issues. We didn't have the\n   necessity of walking down the mountain or going through ... risk our lives\n   like other people.\n \n \n  "
