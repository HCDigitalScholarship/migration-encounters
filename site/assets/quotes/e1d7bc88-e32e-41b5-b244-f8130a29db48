  "text":"Jeimmy: And they were trying to look for a substitute teacher. So while\n   they were looking for a substitute teacher, we were like three weeks\n   without a teacher. So you could imagine kids just coming in and out of the\n   classroom, throwing stuff. Everybody was doing whatever they wanted. And\n   then they found a substitute teacher, but the kids were so horrible that\n   the substitute teacher left crying and didn't come back.\n \n \n  "
