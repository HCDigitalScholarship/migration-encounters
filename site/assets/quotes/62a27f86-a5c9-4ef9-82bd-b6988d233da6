But she's helping him and\n   I can't see her because I don't have the money to bring her. Do you know\n   the flights and everything? I mean, I have very much contact with her and\n   with my boy. With him I talk\u2014of course he don't have Facebook or\n   anything\u2014every 15 days and with my daughter every time she's on Facebook we\n   talk. But she have a baby and I haven't meet him. He's going to be already\n   two years old. So I don't know, it's just a nightmare.\n \n \n  "
