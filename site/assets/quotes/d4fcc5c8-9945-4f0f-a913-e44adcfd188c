Then in\n come these soldiers, U.S. soldiers, come into the restaurant.\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, so they come in, they sit down and then they get into a\n political discussion. That's already the first error. My brother, he starts\n talking about the corruption dude and just about the government bro and\n he's saying this to these U.S. soldiers.\n      \n      \n Anita: About the corruption?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yes, in the U.S. of course. So, the soldiers, I don't know what\n happened, I think it got heated, the argument, and they called the police,\n not to arrest anybody just to get the information out of them. Just to get\n the story. Okay? Yes, so they come, and they start talking, \"Oh yeah, it\n was just a political discussion that got a little heated.\" They get the\n soldiers' names, they leave, they look for my brother and they can't find\n him. They were like, \"Sir, we can't find you in the system.\" [Claps]\n Deported.\n      \n      \n B"
