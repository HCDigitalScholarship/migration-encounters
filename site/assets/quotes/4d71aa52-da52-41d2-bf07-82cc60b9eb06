I\n   didn't like going to school because I didn't understand anything. Then they\n   started giving me like, \"Okay, you are going to be half your time here and\n   half your time in a Spanish class.\" So that kind of helped me understand.\n   And then when I was like in second grade, then they're like, \"Okay, you're\n   ready to be in a full English class.\" Yeah.\n \n \n  "
