  "text":"Mike: So yeah, I feel like it was around my freshman year, everything\n   started going downhill, because I used to be in events, classes, and all my\n   teachers loved me. I would have conversations like this with my teachers\n   and they'd be amazed sometimes like, \"Wow, this kid has so much insight. So\n   much to talk about.\" And they would always encourage me, but the thing\n   about it is I wouldn't feel like that.\n \n \n   Mike: I would always feel like, \"I'm not shit. What are they talking about?\n   What do they see in me that I don't see in myself?\" And it sucked because\n   other people looked at my potential and I put myself so low that I didn't\n   even look at that. Every time they're like, \"Dude, you've got so much\n   potential.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, right dude, what are you talking about?\n   You just trying to butter me up man.\"\n \n \n  "
