  "text":"Anita: Tell me about the tattoo on your arm.\n \n \n   Ruben: It's a portrait of one of my elementary friends. We grew up\n   together.\n \n \n   Ruben: We were like brothers, inseparable. Wherever he went, I went.\n   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed\n   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I\n   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.\n   \"Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.\" I took the blame for both of\n   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his\n   house.\n \n \n   Anita: By?\n \n \n   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.\n   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me\n   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool\n   frien"
