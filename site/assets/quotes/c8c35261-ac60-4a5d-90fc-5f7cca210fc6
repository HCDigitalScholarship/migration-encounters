  "text":"Claudia: Why? Do you think it's because of all the tattoos?\n \n \n   Yosell: Probably, that's probably why it is. The way you dress.\n \n \n   Yosell: Since I do remember I was maybe 17 or 16 when I started getting\n   tattooed drunk.\n \n \n   Claudia: Here or in the States?\n \n \n   Yosell: Out in the States.\n \n \n   Claudia: What did you like about tattoos?\n \n \n   Yosell: Basically, the story it tells. There's a lot of things into it.\n \n \n   Claudia: Do you have a favorite one?\n \n \n   Yosell: My favorite one would probably be like I have these two angels\n   here. Those are my two brothers, so I decided to get them, and I got my mom\n   tattooed on my head.\n \n \n   Claudia: Oh wow, that's amazing.\n \n \n   Yosell: That's probably one of my favorite ones. Let's see, I had a cousin\n   that got shot out in the States out in Utah, so I ended up getting a Salt\n   Lake tattoo right here.\n \n \n   Claudia: Oh, I see.\n \n \n   Yosell: I guess there's a couple. I got these two right here, it's probably\n   my favorite tattoo, actually. It says\u2014\n \n \n   Claudia: Did that hurt a lot? I know that's a stupid question, but I'm just\n   very curious.\n \n \n   Yosell: [Laughs]. It didn't hurt quite as much as I thought it would, it\n   was just more like, \"Oh my eyes are really like, tiring,\" kind of stuff, so\n   that didn't really hurt. I think the worst I've ever had hurt was probably\n   right here on the collarbone area. Yeah, that's probably the worst.\n \n \n   Claudia: We've heard from a lot of people here tattoos are kind of\n   associated with gangs and criminal activity over in the States, and that's\n   why a lot of migrants when they come back get profiled. Do you think that's\n   true?\n \n \n   Yosell: I have to tell you, I'm going to guess that's really true. Because\n   it's just something really common up there. Either you join something and\n   you're known as hardcore, you're known as somebody, or you don't join\n   anything and you get bullied around. That's what I could say.\n \n \n  "
