  "text":"Anita: And what was it like crossing the border the second time?\n \n \n   Diana: The second time was more scary because I was 19 and my son was two\n   years old. So then we went over there, and it was with my husband and then\n   it was also \u2013 the first time I crossed by Tijuana, and then the second time\n   we went through Sonora. So then it more hard. And then the first time, they\n   took us on a van with more people. The good thing is that since I had my\n   son, I was sitting on the front and then everybody was like hiding in the\n   back and stuff like that. But then they caught us and then they deport us.\n \n \n   Anita: You got caught?\n \n \n   Diana: Once. So then while we stay at the border, that same people, you\n   know the coyotes, they told us, \u201cOkay, go back here,\u201d and everything. And\n   then the second time we cross, but it was not with a lot of people no more.\n   It was just me, my husband, and a couple, and an old guy just took us on\n   the car.\n \n \n   Anita: And you were with your son?\n \n \n   Diana: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: But did you have to walk in the desert, or you went by car?\n \n \n   Diana: By car. Yeah, it was by car.\n \n \n   Anita: Okay, how did you decide where you were going to go live?\n \n \n   Diana: My mom was over there in ____, so we went, and I stayed with my mom\n   for a little bit.\n \n \n  "
