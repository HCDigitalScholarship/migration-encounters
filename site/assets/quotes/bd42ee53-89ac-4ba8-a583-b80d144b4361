  "text":"This situation I only did\n   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two\n   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my\n   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, \"His first\n   time being a father,\" this and that. \"Give him an opportunity.\" They did.\n   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.\n \n \n   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the\n   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one\n   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know\n   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks\n   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my\n   lawyer and was like, \"Hey, what's going on?\" He's like, \"For a fight. Best\n   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping.\" As a minor,\n   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee\n   under their eyes.\n \n \n   Weco: So, he's like, \"Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will\n   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.\"\n   So I was like, \"All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I\n   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too.\" He's\n   like, \"All right.\"\n \n \n   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.\n   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,\n   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then\n   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.\n \n \n  "
