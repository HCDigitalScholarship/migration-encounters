  "text":"Yordani: I guess just the culture, I guess. Yeah, I had Mexican parents,\n   but it's like I interacted more with Americans, so it's like... I guess,\n   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm\n   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,\n   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they\n   dress a certain way. They have their own style. I don't really follow that.\n   You know, like they dress in their hats and stuff like that and like I\n   don't really do that. Like the music too, I don't really feel like I really\n   like Mexican music. It's like I'm forcing myself to do it because I want to\n   fit in, but in the end I don't.\n \n \n  "
