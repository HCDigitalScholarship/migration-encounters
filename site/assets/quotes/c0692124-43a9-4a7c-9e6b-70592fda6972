I want my restaurant and\n I still want it.\n      \n      \n Isabel: What would you call it?\n      \n      \n Angelo: All styles, all around the world restaurant. That's what I want,\n all around the world restaurant. Something from every place. And that's\n what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single\n style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had\n a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep\n learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as\n there is, and that's my dream one day to have my own store, maybe here in\n Mexico\u2014most definitely here in Mexico because I really don't see any\n chances for me to go back.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So that's your plan for Mexico too, or your dream?\n      \n      \n Angelo: My dream to have my own store. That's my dream, that's my goal, to\n have my own restaurant, that's my passion. I love the reaction from the\n clients and I just love making good food.\n      \n      \n"
