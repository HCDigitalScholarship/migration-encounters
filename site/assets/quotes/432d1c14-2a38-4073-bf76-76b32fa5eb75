  "text":"Yeah, so I was there and then it got a little bit rougher\n   as time passed. And violence was\u2026 just a poor quality of life overall.\n   Violence, poor services. Because since it's outside of Mexico City in\n   another state\u2014it's close but it's still another state. It's called an\n   unprivileged neighborhood or something like that\u2014they have a formal name\n   for it. So, we were living over there and the conditions were really\n   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents. \n   They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us\u2026 \u201cYou can \n   always come and live with me.\u201d And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation\n   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we\n   disappeared.\n \n \n  "
