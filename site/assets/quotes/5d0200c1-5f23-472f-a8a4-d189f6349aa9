  "text":"lly: I am a Mexican right? And so, it's like, \"Dude, you're American but\n you're not? This was crazy!\u201d and so right there I was like, \"Dude, what am\n I?\" At one point I was like, \"Dude, what am I? Am I...?\" Not in terms of\n who I am, in personality, but my nationality. I was like, \"Am I American or\n am I Mexican?\" Eventually I just said I was Mexican. That's my nationality,\n that's where I was born but I had an experience in the U.S. you hear me?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, it's just like, because people are like, \"Bro, are you white?\"\n I don't like saying I'm white because I'm not white. It's like, \"I'm not\n white, Bro, I'm Mexican.\" They're like, \"How are you Mexican, man? How do\n you speak English like that?\" It's like, \"Yeah, man. I'm Mexican. It's\n cool, bro, it's cool.\"\n      \n      \n Anita: So, you said you were Mexican. Why did you say you were Mexican?\n      \n      \n Billy: Just because I couldn't say I was white. What am I going to say? I'm\n white? No, I'm Mexican. But at first, I thought I was white. I was like,\n \"Dude, you're just a skater kid. You're American.\" Then after I started...\n My dad told me, \"Dude, if you get arrested, that's going to be an issue.\"\n That's when I realized, \"Bro, you're Mexican, dude, and this is part of\n you. This is part of your roots. Just be proud of it. Grab it and be proud\n of it.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So now I'm proud to be Mexican and it's awesome because when a white\n guy thinks I'm white and I start speaking Spanish he's like, \"Whoa man, I\n didn't know Mexicans could do all that.\" And it's like, \"Yeah, bro. Yeah,\n man. I'm here to show that. I'm an example.\" So now I'm even more proud of\n being Mexican.\n      \n      \n A"
