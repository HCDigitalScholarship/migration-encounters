  "text":"my mom always told me, she's like,\n \"Trust me, you don't want to go to Mexico.\" She's like, \"Life over there is\n not as you picture it. It's like your cousins and everything, they say\n they're having fun over there, but they've been over there they're whole\n life.\" He's like, \"You? You're going to have difficulties.\" One, is the\n tattoos. Two is they look at y'all as a target more because not only for\n y'all as in general, but then also because they know that you have family\n over here, they try to use it as extortion and they have tried to call her\n a couple times and tell her that they have me and, \"We have your son and\n you better send some money and blah, blah, blah.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: But she always have someone with her like my sister or my stepdad or\n something, and while she's on the phone with them, then my stepdad, my\n sister contacts me to make sure that it's not true and that way they can\n just go ahead and blow it off and stuff, but thankfully, nothing like that\n has actually happened but they always worry about that part of... They\n worry more about that than anything else. They know that I can take care of\n myself and they know that I work and I'll make my money and I can handle\n myself as far as economically, but they're still worried about just because\n they know how the environment is. Not only just in the streets, but just\n everywhere in general, the transports, everything. You can't even get in\n transports without have your hands in your pockets or grabbing your stuff\n because if not, somebody will just take it in the middle of nowhere. Next\n thing you know, you're just like, \"Oh, my wallet, my phone's gone.\" I don't\n even know where it happened, nothing.\n      \n      \n"
