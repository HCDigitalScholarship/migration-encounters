  "text":"Luis: Yeah. It was mostly something that I knew. If I went with one of my\n   friends and tell him, \"Hey, I'm not a US citizen. So how do you feel about\n   it?\" I knew he probably would've accepted me because we knew each other for\n   so long, but I don't know, there was always that doubt inside of me. That\n   like, \u201cWhat if he tells all the other kids? What if they start treating me\n   like they treated that girl over there?\u201d\n \n \n   Anita: So, you didn\u2019t tell your friends?\n \n \n   Luis: Nope. They always assumed that I was a kid that they knew from the\n   neighborhood. So yeah, I guess I was just lucky or maybe I just remained\n   silent.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you kept that secret?\n \n \n   Luis: And I think that was good.\n \n \n  "
