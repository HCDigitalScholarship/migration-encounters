So, There was\n   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being\n   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but\n   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was\n   like, \"Oh, it's just this normal thing.\" My black friends, they were doing\n   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was\n   just in general.\n \n \n  "
