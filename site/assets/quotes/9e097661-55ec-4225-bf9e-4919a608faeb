  "text":"Claudia: In what ways do you think that being in the U.S. all that time\n   shaped who you are?\n \n \n   Yosell: I think the only way I can put it really is just being strong.\n   Because basically you got to learn how to mature in a faster way than you'd\n   probably do it here. I've seen a couple of family members or friends here\n   that are like 30 years old and they're still living with their dad and mom.\n   They're just like not doing anything for their life, and opposed of people\n   out there, most of them that I do know were just living by themselves and\n   doing their thing. I'd say out there it's probably not that good because\n   you\u2019d get, because most of the people would get into some kind of a drug\n   addiction or something like that. I\u2019d say, here, here it'd be probably the\n   same, but out there it'd be easier to make money. Here it's a lot harder.\n   That's probably what's the difference here to there. That's what I'm\n   saying, I think out there you learn how to be strong. When you come here,\n   you're just like, \"Oh.\" most people get depressed or frustrated here.\n   Others actually know how to move on and continue. That's probably how I see\n   it.\n \n \n  "
