I'm\n getting all my stuff translated, getting whatever\u201d\u2014having it be more like,\n maybe, have someone help throughout the process or more available to help\n throughout because it sometimes feels like a secret like, \"Oh, I can go to\n college here, I didn't know.\" That's a really hard thing and I think a lot\n of people would love to go to school if they could.\n      \n      \n"
