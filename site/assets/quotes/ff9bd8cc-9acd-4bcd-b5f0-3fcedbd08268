  "text":"everything was good and I stayed out of\n trouble from 14 all the way till I was 19, which is when the recent charges\n and everything came, the evading arrest and I got my shit. I didn't have no\n reason to evade arrest, I didn't have anything on me or anything. I had had\n one or two beers. I wasn't drunk or anything, but I did know I had kind of\n smell, and I knew that they were going to play that on me, and I was still\n at...\n      \n      \n Anne: Did they pull you over? Were you speeding or something?\n      \n      \n Axel: No. I wasn't speeding. They just said that it was random checks. But\n really, I really think they just ran the plates, they saw that I had a\n couple tickets before for no license, stuff like that, so they do the check\n again. I was like, \"Okay, they're going to smell my breath. One, they're\n going to smell my breath, they're going to say I'm drunk. Two, I don't have\n my license. Three, I'm underage, I'm not even 21 so I'm not even supposed\n to have alcohol at all.\" I'm like, that's just not looking good at all for\n me, so I panicked, I stepped on the gas and I left.\n      \n      \n"
