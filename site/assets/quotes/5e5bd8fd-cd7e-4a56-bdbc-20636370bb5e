It was like a mix\n   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us\n   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special\n   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the\n   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].\n \n \n  "
