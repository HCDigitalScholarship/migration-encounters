  "text":"Lizzy: What do you miss the most about the States?\n \n \n   Laila: I would say my family, mostly. Probably the opportunities that you\n   would get there. In Mexico, it's really hard to get an opportunity. A lot\n   of people are where they are because they know someone [Laughs] or because\n   they've paid to be there and it's really hard trying to be what they would\n   say, the working class. Trying to work your way to a point where you know\n   you're successful and you can say, \"I've done a lot of things.\" But if\n   you're not the cousin of the owner, or if you're not a family member\n   related to somebody in power, it's like you don't have a chance.\n \n \n  "
