  "text":"Anita: So how did your daughter get in touch with yeah?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: By her grandma. I had her grandma in Facebook, and we talk\n   sometimes, and she got ahold of me by phone. I was like, \"Great.\" I mean,\n   it was for a long time that she wouldn't get in touch with me. She didn't\n   even try to talk to me, and now she did. I'm like, \"Well, this is one step,\n   no, towards \u2013.\u201d\n \n \n   Anita: Your friends with her grandma, which is your ex-wife's mother, on\n   Facebook?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I get along with them, except with the mom. I get along with both\n   sisters, with both brothers, and with the grandma. I mean, we get along,\n   but with her, we don't get in touch at all. I mean, she doesn't want to\n   talk to me, and I mean, that's fine because she's already with somebody\n   else. I respect that. Plus, I don't want to know anything about it either.\n   But there's something, she don't want\u2026 It's because she doesn't want... She\n   will want it. She will be like, \"You know what? I pay for the passport. She\n   pays for this. We do this. We do that.\" So, he will be able to go over\n   there, and my daughter will be able to come over there. We could be\n   connected, but she doesn\u2019t want to do that.\n \n \n   Anita: She doesn't want to? But is she going to allow her daughter to come\n   here?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, that's the thing that we were planning. I mean, I was\n   telling my daughter, \"Right now, I wish I could have the money to be like,\n   'You know what? I'll send you for the passport. And I have the plane\n   ticket.'\" But it's a process. I mean, I don't want to put things on the\n   hurry. I want just to be little by little. Probably if not by when she will\n   be 18, it will be different. Right now, this is one step. I know in one\n   time she will be able to come and is sooner than before.\n \n \n   Anita: When was the last time you saw her?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Oh, yeah. It has 11 years.\n \n \n   Anita: It's been 11 years?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: It's been 11 years, and I want to see her already. I mean, I want\n   to see her. I know she needs me, and I need her, too.\n \n \n   Anita: Have you spoken on FaceTime?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you see each other?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. But, I mean, it's not the same. I wish it would be like I\n   could have her here right here.\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah. Does she look like you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I will show you a picture right now. Let me see. Hold on. Let me\n   see. She's really big, though.\n \n \n  "
