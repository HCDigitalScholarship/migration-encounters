  "text":"Jeimmy: Something else, I don't know why. This isn\u2019t general, but the\n   majority of women in Mexico or girls these days, they're 14, 15 years old,\n   and they're already getting pregnant and having kids when they barely\n   finished middle school. So it's like everybody looks at me, or at least in\n   my family, and it's like, \"Oh, Jeimmy, why haven't you gotten married yet?\"\n   Like, \"I'm 22 years old. I still live with my parents. Why would I get\n   married?\" [Laughs].\n \n \n  "
