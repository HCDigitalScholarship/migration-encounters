I don't know why\n   there was a lot of fucking trucks, there was a lot of people running around\n   border just making their patrols and stuff. But I don't know, I just didn't\n   want to be caught because I knew for some guys that when they got caught,\n   they just beat the shit out of them, and they just bring them back to\n   Mexico. But no, I just didn't get caught. I crossed the fence. And I\n   started running as fast as I could.\n \n \n  "
