  "text":"Mike: It was gang members. I used to hang out with people that they didn't\n   care for themselves. I remember walking into my friend's house and the\n   house was just like, \"Oh my God.\" It was like a tornado went in and I\n   usually don't hang out with people like this. I was so scared just being in\n   that house and I just started getting used to it, because those are the\n   people that I could not relate to, but I had something in common like,\n   \"Okay if you're not ish, then I'm not an ish either.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So we relate and I feel like kind of adopted. They kind of adopted\n   me. The streets adopted me kind of in a way. I didn't really have a\n   relationship with my family. When there was a family events or anything, I\n   felt like an outcast. I would never go to them. Christmas, I was always in\n   my room. Every little... It's just weird man. Everything messed me up. I\n   feel like traumatic. Just the trauma of everything.\n \n \n  "
