  "text":"Nothing\n   happened. Yeah, it changed a lot. It changed the way I viewed everything\n   around me. Like, spring break all my friends would go certain places out of\n   the country, and I used to get invited and, \"No, I can't go man, my family\n   doesn't think...\" It would always have to be lie after lie after lie. I\n   didn't want to... for one, I always had that idea of like my mom and my\n   family always told me, \"Don't ever tell anybody you're an immigrant. If\n   somebody has that knowledge they can do you harm. They can take you away\n   from here, they can take us away from each other.\"\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I'm seeing it now, with the families going across the border, and\n   them being separated. I didn't understand it at the time, and man, now I do\n   understand it. I didn't know how it really was until I finally got put in\n   handcuffs and got shipped to an immigration facility.\n \n \n  "
