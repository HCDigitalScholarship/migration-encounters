  "text":"uis: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a\n   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that\n   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start\n   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.\n \n \n   Anne: Oh, yeah.\n \n \n   Luis: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw\n   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, \u201cOh, this is what I do for\n   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even\n   get papers.\u201d But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the\n   country and I couldn't move.\n \n \n   Anne: You couldn't get on a plane, right?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, \"You know\n   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting\n   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.\u201d They didn't want me to and for two\n   years they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I\n   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back\n   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in\n   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because\n   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I\n   want to do. Because after break dance I was like, what if I become a\n   firefighter? Never mind, I can't do that. So yeah. And so I came back and I\n   thought, \u201cOkay, this is going to be\u2026this is going to be kind of difficult.\n   But I mean I already been here. Right? I already been here and\u2014\"\n \n \n  "
