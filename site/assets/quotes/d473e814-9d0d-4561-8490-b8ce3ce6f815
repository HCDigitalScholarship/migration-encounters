  "text":"Even though we were kids, we knew like,\n     \"I don't like this, this Chicano, this gang member thing.\" I was invited\n     many times to join them because of discrimination with them. I never had\n     this bad experience with an American telling me, \"You're a wetback.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     No, I had the bad experience with Chicanos telling me I'm a wetback, and I\n     had a lot of fights there. I used to tell them, \"You know what? I'm a\n     wetback, but guess what? I know what I am. I'm Mexican. You don't know what\n     you are. You don't know. Tell me what you are, and I\u2019ll respect you.\" That\n     got me into a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble because that's what my mom\n     told me. \"They don't know what they are. You know what you are. You're\n     Mexican. They don't know.\" She taught me about it. \u201cYou know, they go to\n     Dodger Stadium, they're Americans, hotdogs, beer, all this. Cinco de Mayo,\n     they're Mexican. So tell me what they are.\u201d\n \n \n    "
