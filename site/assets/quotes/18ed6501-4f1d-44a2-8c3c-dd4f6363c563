  "text":"Do you\n consider yourself more Mexican or American?\n      \n      \n Ana: Oh, that's a hard, hard question. So I consider myself more Mexican or\n American. It's funny because just yesterday, there's a fair here. I'm not\n sure if you're aware of it. It's called feria de las culturas amigas. it's\n in Chapultepec, which is basically, it's a fair that happens every year. A\n lot of whole different countries come, and they expose their culture. It's\n beautiful. Yesterday, I was there and we stopped by US, a friend of mine\n and me. It was really funny because he mentioned to me, he was like,\n \u201cyou're more gringa, so this is where you should be.\u201d And I was just like,\n \"Ugh, no.\" Basically, I don't know. I think 10 years ago, if you would've\n asked me, I would have said American, definitely. I think six years of\n finally accepting where I am, really adapting to, trying to adapt to where\n I currently am, I still wouldn't say\u2026I'm leaning more towards Mexican, but\n I think, I'm not sure.\n      \n      \n"
