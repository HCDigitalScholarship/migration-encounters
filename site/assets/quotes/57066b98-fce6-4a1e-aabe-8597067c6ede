  "text":"Ben: But over twenty, 22-23 years.\n      \n      \n Anne: 23 years? And were you worried about getting deported those 23 years?\n      \n      \n Ben: Right after my daughter was born, yes, every day, the thought\n would cross my mind. I had many brushes with Immigration, as we're in the\n construction business. Many times, job sites would get raided and the only\n thing was just to keep cool and walk straight up to them. Don't walk away\n from them, if I seen them walking this way, I walked towards them instead\n of walking away from them. I walked towards them.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, they probably, you being the head guy, they didn't think of you\n as much\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: No, but during the raids I don't think they had any idea of who\n was the head guy or not.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh.\n      \n      \n Ben: Because a lot of the times, a lot of these raids, I was all\n covered in drywall, compound, white compound all over me, almost like if\n you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't\u2026I would just walk right up\n to them. And there was another gentleman\u2014this was amazing because he didn't\n speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come\n up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never\n run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and\n immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one\n officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because\n there was a big old wall.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: And so, he finally gets out and comes inside the house and he\n walks right past me and that happened a couple times where they would just\n walk right past me, didn't even acknowledge that I was even there, nothing.\n I go, \"Is God making me invisible?\" [Chuckle]. It really felt like that\n because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.\n He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the\n scaffold and he goes, \"[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?\u201d and from up there\n he goes, \"Yeah.\u201d And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.\n      \n      \n Ben: And it was three times with that one person. And then after that\n last time that I was with him that happened, he goes, \"Look at that,\n they're taking all these poor guys that don't want to go. I want to go\n back, I want a free ride back. But they don't want to take me.\u201d And I spoke\n to a cousin of his, it\u2019s probably been about three years ago, and I asked\n him about him, and he says, \"To this day, he don't have his residency, he\n never got his papers.\u201d He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was\n when I talked to his cousin. His cousin goes, \"He's in Atlanta, but to this\n day he never got his papers and he's never been deported.\u201d And I go, \"Some\n people are lucky and some are not\".\n      \n      \n"
