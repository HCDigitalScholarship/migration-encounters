But then there's some people, I have some cousins,\n   they don't like to be there. So, I mean, sometimes we like to joke around,\n   let's trade spots, you know. Because they like Mexico and I don't like\n   Mexico. They don't like being in the States. But that's because they were\n   born over there. If they were born over here, they would be the same thing.\n \n \n  "
