Later we knew that if they would have\n   called the cops, we could have probably fought back, legally because they\n   can't physically hit my mom if they're an employee. We were just scared,\n   they scared us out of doing anything by telling us that they were going to\n   call ICE.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Of course you'd be scared. How old were you when that happened?\n \n \n   Laila: I was around eight. I was around eight years old when that happened.\n   We never went back there. Later the store closed completely.\n \n \n  "
