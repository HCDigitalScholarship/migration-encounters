  "text":"And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was\n the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me\n and to my family. So, I said \u201cI'm going to be the best father,\u201d and I want\n to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my\n kids right now, they stay with their grandparents\u2014they don't have a father.\n I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are\n they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.\n      \n      \n"
