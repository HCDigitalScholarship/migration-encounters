  "text":"Anne: So in high school, you're not liking school as much. When did you\n   figure out that you were undocumented? Or did you know it all along?\n \n \n   Edgar: No. I think I found out... I thought about it. But I found out, I\n   was like around eight years old.\n \n \n   Anne: Eight years old?\n \n \n   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah. Watching the TV and everything, watching people getting\n   deported. And, yeah. My mom pretty much told me that we were undocumented.\n   That's when I found out.\n \n \n   Anne: Did she tell you to be careful or...\n \n \n   Edgar: Well not really to be careful, nothing like that. But just that\n   we're not from here. We're from Mexico.\n \n \n   Anne: So as you're growing up, how did you feel when your friends were\n   getting their licenses and starting to drive cars?\n \n \n   Edgar: Oh, man. Yeah. It felt different. It felt way apart. Not like, I\n   don't belong with them. Like I wanted to get that but I couldn't.\n \n \n  "
