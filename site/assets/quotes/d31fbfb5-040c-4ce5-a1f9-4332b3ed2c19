And\n   I was like, \"Okay.\" It wasn't hard for me to go to sleep, so I just fell\n   asleep. And when I woke up, I was over there, everything was so different.\n   So I was surprised... I don't know. I felt good.\n \n \n   Isabel: What was different?\n \n \n   Pablo: I mean, you can see everything... It was just\u2026 the city was just\n   more clean, or I don't know, it's just a lot of different stuff. The stores\n   and buildings and everything was just different.\n \n \n  "
