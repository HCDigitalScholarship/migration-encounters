  "text":"Jose: Yeah. Actually, I don't remember it being as difficult as people say\n   it is now. But back then I remember we were driving just on the street. We\n   could see the border and then you know the river? The bridge? We got out\n   maybe like a couple of miles before that, went into the bushes. We waited\n   until nighttime. At nighttime, we went in inflatable rafts. I was on\n   somebody's back and they crossed us over one by one. Once everybody crossed\n   over, we ran for a couple of minutes to a Walmart. I remember going inside\n   the Walmart \u2018cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and\n   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel\n   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to\n   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas\u2014we got stranded\n   in Texas. Yeah, another whole different coyote had to come and pick us up.\n   And that coyote delivered us from Texas to ____, where I've been living for\n   like 16 years.\n \n \n  "
