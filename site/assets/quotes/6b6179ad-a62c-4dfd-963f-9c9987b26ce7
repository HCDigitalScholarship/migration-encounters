I know call centers, they pay pretty well,\n   more than on the street or working in construction, but my plan right now\n   is to get on track in my studies, get my GED, get to university, get some\n   career. Well, to get a career as quick as possible because I'm not speaking\n   about ten years from now or five years from now, I'm speaking\u2014well maybe\n   five years. Ten years is too much. I'm trying to hurry up as quick as\n   possible and get a job.\n \n \n  "
