  "text":"Mike: Yeah. I had to. That's the only thing that I could do. And I\n   remembered to try to be good with the mother of my kids, I went after she\n   invited me to go with one of her friends because they had a hotel in a\n   resort casino. And I remember that I just wanted to please her. I wanted to\n   make her happy.\n \n \n   Mike: So again it's really hard to make someone happy when you can't\n   provide for them. So every little thing, I was just trying to be kind of a\n   kiss ass. And yeah, I went with her. I didn't like her friend. I hated her\n   friend. It's just one of her friends that always made her do bad stuff.\n \n \n  "
