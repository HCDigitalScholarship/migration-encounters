  "text":"So, she offered it to me that we can\n   continue, try to see if we can get any type of help so you can continue\n   studying and also my parents offered me if I wanted came back to Mexico\n   because I wanted to get into the Army, but they told me that if I want to\n   serve to country that I should serve to my country. So that's another\n   reason why I also come back to Mexico.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Did you think about serving in the Army in the U.S. or in Mexico?\n \n \n   Frank: Actually, this get into my mind because my brother when he was on\n   the senior high, he got this paper saying that he wanted to serve but it\n   was just a copy, not the hard copy. My dad just break it off and say if you\n   want to go serve to a country, serve to your country. My brother came on to\n   tell us in 2015 and in 2016 that he get into the Mexico army.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Do you still want to join the army here?\n \n \n   Frank: Actually, I try it four times. I try first for an engineer and\n   because of the culture exam I wasn't able to get in. On the second one. I\n   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon\n   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits\n   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve\n   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh\n   space, so I needed seven people more to quit so I could get in to join in.\n   The other two times I tried again, but the first time they told me for the\n   engineer [program] I was over the age that I wasn't able to continue on\n   because I wanted to get into the army to continue studying, but they told\n   me because of the age I was not able to get into that program.\n \n \n  "
