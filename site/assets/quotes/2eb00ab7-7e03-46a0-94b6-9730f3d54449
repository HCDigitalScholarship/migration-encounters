Maybe because we were always outside of like Mexico City.\n   \u2018Cause even though me and my brother, we were born in Veracruz, but\n   nobody's from over there, just my parents were there by that time. And so,\n   we never really got to see my uncles, cousins, so I never got like really\n   attached to them. It was always my family.\n \n \n  "
