On top of that, we're not from there. So we don't have papers. Not\n   papers, but you know how you have to get the medical shots. We had to redo\n   all of that stuff. So my mom got the shots, did all the immunization\n   records and all that stuff. When we were with my dad, we didn't have none\n   of that. So we had to redo it again.\n \n \n   Anne: You didn't go to school for two years?\n \n \n  "
