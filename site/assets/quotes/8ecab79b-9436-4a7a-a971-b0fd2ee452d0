  "text":"Melani: 6,500 pesos per month, and they give you commissions. But they\n   always trick you and they always keep your money. So it's not really\n   beneficial to work there.\n \n \n   And I said, \u201cWell fine. I guess I can't find a job and I don't really know\n   anyone around here. So I'll take the job with my aunt, since I know I'll be\n   with family.\u201d I took it, but when I got there I hated it because they\n   discriminated [against] me because of my Spanish. They would talk behind my\n   back. And they had no respect towards employees because there's a lot of\n   classism in Mexico, and if you're not in an upper class or have a high\n   position in society, then you're nobody and they treat you like if you were\n   their slave.\n \n \n  "
