  "text":"Laila: It was scary for me, thinking that we were that close to a police\n   officer. It came to the point where I was scared of the police, completely.\n   I couldn't even trust them with, I don't know, an emergency or something\n   because I knew that they might ask me for papers and I would be completely,\n   I don't know, done at that point. I was actually my parent's translator\n   since I was very young. They didn't have a lot of time to learn English,\n   they just decided to work. So, since I was a child, I would always go with\n   them into stores or places where they needed an English speaker, and I\n   would do that for them. They received a lot of discrimination at various\n   parts. We actually, my mom actually, got into a physical fight with a woman\n   at a store because she called her a dirty immigrant and wetback. My mom\n   physically got into a fight with her, and she was an employee of the store,\n   and it wasn't even called for.\n \n \n  "
