  "text":"Rodolfo: The Mexican government, they provided some help. They provided 50\n   pesos when I first got here. And they just give me a whole bunch of\n   pamphlets of school and housing, right? But I feel as though independent\n   organizations were the ones who ultimately would have helped me a lot more.\n   When I first got off the plane, they told me about all the resources, all\n   the help, all the things that their company or their organization did for\n   other people, deportees. So, I feel like independent organizations would\n   have helped me more than the Mexican government.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: What can the Mexican government do to help deportees?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Well, I mean, look, when I first got here, apart from them giving\n   me 50 pesos... In my opinion, the Mexican government can be more supportive\n   in having\u2014I don't know,\u2014what I was thinking is probably a fund, you know?\n   Or maybe a fund or some type of little packet. Not saying that we all are\n   entitled to it, but it'd be good to get here and have a little bit of money\n   or a place for yourself, or right away giving out jobs or something like\n   that. I'm not saying that the Mexico City doesn't have jobs for a bilingual\n   speaker or bilingual people but it's through third party organizations,\n   outsourcing and stuff like that.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: But if the Mexican government really do want to help then that\n   would be my suggestion. More jobs, more jobs for people like us. And not\n   just for people us more so, but that would help out everybody else. Or\n   simply, when I got here maybe there'd be a little fund that everybody gets,\n   a certain amount of money to start their own business. Because I did hear\n   about something like that. That there are help for people that want to\n   start their business, especially if you're deportees.\n \n \n  "
