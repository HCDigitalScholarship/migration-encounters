  "text":"Do you remember arriving in the US? Your first day there? That's\n   what I wanted to hear about.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, pretty much, it was something different. I mean, you are\n   used to be right here in Mexico, where I was used to being right here in\n   Mexico. To go over there, to see different people, pretty much, the\n   differences, how people speak, because it was really different. I didn't\n   know anything about English. We were like, \"What are they talking about?\"\n   We were like, \"What?\" That's the only word I knew. But it was pretty much\n   good. But at first it was like even the TV, the news, everything was\n   different. I was a kid. I mean, the way you see, I was a kid and it was\n   really different. I tried to play with the other kids, but they couldn\u2019t\n   speak Spanish, and I couldn\u2019t speak English.\n \n \n  "
