I don't think that that's a nice thing to do.\" I work here in\n   a college, in a private school, and the principal, she was horrible to me.\n   She was like, \"You need to cover your ears.\" She didn't even allow me to\n   put my hair up, even if the weather was too hot.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah, you're sweaty and stuff.\n \n \n  "
