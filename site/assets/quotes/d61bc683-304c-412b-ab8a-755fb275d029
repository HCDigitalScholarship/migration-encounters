If they ran it\n through, it'd be like, \"Oh, it fell, didn't go through. Maybe the number's\n wrong, can you double check it?\" And you're like, \"Okay, yeah, let me go\n ahead and double check it.\" And you just never go to that place again\n because you know they're going to check it, so you're just like, \"No, never\n mind. Let's try another place.\"\n      \n      \n"
