  "text":"Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is\n   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,\n   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, \u201cI'm not like that, guys, for\n   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of\n   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I\n   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the\n   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.\n   I'm not taking that.\u201d Also, there's quite a few situations that I went\n   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the\n   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying\n   to think what to do. You don\u2019t have to deal with it, you have to return to\n   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you\n   guys thinking about?\u201d\n \n \n  "
