  "text":"Weco: If I was still in the U.S., I think I'd still have my job that I had\n   out there, which was the cleaning, and I'd just be out there taking care of\n   my son. That's all I was out there. When I actually got out on my bond and\n   I had my son with me for that period of time, that's all I did. Just went\n   to work, relaxed, came home. That's it. That's all I really done. After I\n   had my son, I really stopped. I stopped all my bull crap. I grew up without\n   a father, so I know what it's like. I told myself that's what they want,\n   and I actually failed at that because I'm down here and he's down there. It\n   hurts me sometimes, but at the end of the day, I made the decision. So, I\n   have to deal with that. But I can tell everybody he going to grow up. He\n   going to know the truth. He's going to know I fucked up. So if he accepts\n   it, then we go from there. If he don't, I got to deal with the consequence.\n \n \n  "
