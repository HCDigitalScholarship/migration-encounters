  "text":"Anita: If you could think back on your experience in the U.S. what would\n   you say is the best part of it, and what was the worst?\n \n \n   Luis: If I had to choose the best part it would be living with my\n   grandparents. I was five years old when they took me into the United\n   States.\n \n \n   Anita: Your grandparents?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. So, sadly, my mom and my dad were having a lot of marital\n   problems between them. So, the thing is that my grandpa, he didn't want me\n   to live as he lived with his parents and stuff so, he kind of said, \"I\n   don\u2019t know, screw it. I'm just going to go ahead and take this kid.\" I have\n   a brother, but my brother was already eight years old, so he knew what was\n   going on and he loved my mom more than anything. But I was a kid. I didn't\n   know what the hell was going on.\n \n \n  "
