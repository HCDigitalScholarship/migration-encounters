  "text":"Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp\n   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They\n   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They\u2019re like, \u201cThis is the best\n   thing that you gave me?\u201d There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three\n   pounds of rice. It was decent. \u201cNo, I don't like the rice, because it's\n   just rice.\u201d \u201cEat it with the chopsticks, I don't think you guys can use it,\n   so use a fork.\u201d They're like, \u201cNo, I don't want to eat just rice.\u201d \u201cWhy?\u201d\n   \u201cBecause I'm not a chicken.\u201d I'm like, \u201cJust eat it.\u201d And now they're\n   saying, \u201cOh it just tastes like garlic.\u201d \u201cThat's what fried rice tastes\n   like! Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.\u201d Yeah,\n   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my\n   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to\n   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef\n   meat. They're happy with it.\n \n \n  "
