  "text":"Jose: No, I just feel that more people need to be more aware of the reasons\n   people are in the States. A lot of people think they're just there to take\n   their jobs, but it's not. People just want a better life. People just want\n   to be part of something. I feel the States is probably one of the best\n   countries in the world and it will be for the future because it's a\n   culmination of so many countries and so many cultures. You take every other\n   culture away, what's there really in the States? Everybody in the States\n   was an immigrant at some point and people forget that. A lot of citizens\n   that are racist towards immigrants forget that their grandparents at some\n   point immigrated from another country for the same reasons they did. I just\n   want people to remember that America is a country of immigrants.\n \n \n  "
