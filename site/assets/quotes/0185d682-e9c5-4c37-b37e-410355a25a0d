  "text":"Yordani: I mean, it was only that one day, and actually the church paid for\n   it because I would go to this church. And yeah, I guess a little silly\n   thing happened, my pastor came... My mom called the pastor because I wasn't\n   listening to the doctor. I guess I was unconscious or something, and the\n   doctor was giving me instructions because they wanted to remove the tube,\n   and I had to sit up or something. I was sedated and they would remove the\n   sedative and I'd wake up and they would ask me to do things, I wouldn't\n   listen. So they called the pastor and I actually listened to him. The\n   doctor would ask me to do something, I'd be like, \"No, I'm laughing here.\"\n   I'd be like, \"No.\" And the pastor came and I was like, \"All right, I did\n   it.\" So they found out about it and they were nice enough to pay for that.\n \n \n  "
