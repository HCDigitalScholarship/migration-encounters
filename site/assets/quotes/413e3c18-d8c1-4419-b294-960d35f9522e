  "text":"Rodolfo: Yeah, absolutely. Ms. Mule, Ms. Mule was my second or third grade\n   teacher, I'm not sure which one it was. She was awesome, she always help me\n   out with the English, always. Even in parent teacher conferences, she would\n   literally always talk to my mom as if she'd be really interested. She would\n   show genuine interest in what was going on with, not just me, but with the\n   Hispanic kids. Kids who had trouble with English or weren't doing the best\n   academically. She always would tell me, \"Don't worry, you're gonna get it.\n   You're gonna learn it.\" She had such a big heart.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Still even, my mother and I still talk about the teacher to this\n   point in time. She tells me, \"I remember Ms. Mule and she used to use hand\n   gestures. She would always be like, 'Yeah, for this or for that.'\" Even\n   though I knew I wasn't the smartest or the most best behaved kid, she would\n   always have that initiative to get us there. Get us to that point. Yeah,\n   that was one of my favorite teachers. Man, I value that so much actually\n   now. I miss that teacher. Another teacher was in fifth grade, his name was\n   Mr. Stoom. He was Argentinian, he was from Argentina. He was another great\n   teacher. He always told us, \"Don't ever forget where you came from. Your\n   roots are who you are, even though you all are coming from different parts\n   of the world, don't ever forget who you are and where you come from.\"\n  "
