  "text":"But\n     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end\n     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,\n     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all\n     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small\n     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that\n     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try\n     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff\n     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down\n     to eat. That's when I was like, \"Okay, what am I doing here? They're making\n     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.\"\n     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're\n     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is\n     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two\n     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back\n     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general\n     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I\n     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the\n     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or\n     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]\n     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started\n     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a\n     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a\n     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much\n     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's\n     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to\n     move forward.\n \n \n    "
