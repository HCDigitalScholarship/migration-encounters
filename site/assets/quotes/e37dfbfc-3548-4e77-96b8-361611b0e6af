  "text":"Joana: Here, for example, if someone rapes you and you go to a police\n   officer, sometimes they really won't help you. There's a lot of corruption\n   that's mainly everywhere, from the president down. Everyone. It's pretty\n   weird because the cartels, they're actually the ones that actually help\n   their states out. They actually offer jobs and the president doesn't. It's\n   like, why? But, it's just the way it is. You're actually scared to actually\n   go up to a police officer because you know that if you get stopped, they're\n   not going to read you the laws. They're going to ask you for money. You're\n   not going to see a U.S. officer do that, ever. They're going to arrest you\n   on the spot. Here, they don't do that. That's how Mexico is.\n \n \n  "
