I was really happy about that, but\n   then you look back, and you're like, \u201cMy dad, my sisters, my house, my\n   toys, my things, what's going to happen?\" I was happy during the day\n   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad\n   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.\n \n \n  "
