  "text":"Anne: How long have you been back?\n \n \n   Juan: I've been here for three years.\n \n \n   Anne: Is it hard?\n \n \n   Juan: At the beginning it was hard because \u2026 Getting adapted to Mexico and\n   not being with my family, but I was determined. I'm still determined\u2014like I\n   told you, right now I'm in college. I'm halfway through my career and, just\n   recently, two weeks ago, I quit my job so I can start to look into \u2026\n   Because I'm done working for another company. I want to start my own\n   company, and I don't know if you met Mauricio, he's one of the teachers\n   here.\n \n \n   Anne: Yes.\n \n \n   Juan: You could say he's been my mentor now because right now he has his\n   school of English and he's showing me the path of how I can be an\n   entrepreneur. Right now, my goals are to, first of all, finish my career\n   and then start off Airbnb. We're looking into that. We're looking for a\n   potential house in Tepoztl\u00e1n, which is an hour and a half from here, which\n   is a really tourist part.\n \n \n   Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the\n   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school\n   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back \u2026 So my parents\n   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it\n   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both\n   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression\n   and started hanging out with the wrong people.\n \n \n   Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.\n   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,\n   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to\n   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, \"We're proud of you and we've\n   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for\n   nothing.\" I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with\n   architecture.\n \n \n   Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of\n   plastic\u2014not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build\n   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,\n   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really\n   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses\n   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are \u2026 How do I\n   say it? Houses that are \u2026 I had the word.\n \n \n   Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because\n   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every\n   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they\n   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.\n   Right now, I'm not looking into the making the profit for me. I want to\n   give back to my community, make it grow.\n \n \n   Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see\n   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home\n   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I\n   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an\n   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills\n   that I'm developing right now.\n \n \n   Anne: That you're studying in school?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes, I'm studying architecture. I want to be able to \u2026 Right now, I'm\n   starting to comprehend how I can make it possible, how I can make houses\n   out of plastic. They're already making it happen in Colombia and they have\n   another method of, here in Mexico City, making houses out of plastic. I\n   want to come up with my own research but I know it takes time, it takes\n   dedication. I'm willing to work for it because it's something positive that\n   I want to give back to my community.\n \n \n   Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and\n   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer\n   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I\n   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,\n   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,\n   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I\n   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.\n \n \n   Anne: That's amazing, that's great, that's wonderful. You have great\n   dreams.\n \n \n   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
