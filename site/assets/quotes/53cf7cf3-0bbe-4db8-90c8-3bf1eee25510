  "text":"Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks\n   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared\n   like a deer in the headlights. \u201cNo, I'm not. I'm not.\u201d I was so scared of\n   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody\u2014an ex-girlfriend, I think\n   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we\n   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we\n   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So\n   I was not allowed to tell anyone.\n \n \n  "
