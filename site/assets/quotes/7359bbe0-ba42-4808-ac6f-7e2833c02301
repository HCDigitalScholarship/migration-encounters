  "text":"Anita: Let's talk about that in a second. I want to ask you one more\n   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that\n   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden\u2026\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave\n   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,\n   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone\n   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who\n   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad\n   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,\n   \"Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.\u201d\n   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I\n   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The\n   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on\n   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.\n \n \n   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with\n   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this\n   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.\n \n \n   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?\n \n \n   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my\n   dad after three, four years?\n \n \n   Anita: You asked him to take you back?\n \n \n   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't\n   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, \"No,\n   that's not happening with us.\"\n \n \n   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?\n \n \n   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking\n   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my\n   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them\n   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate\n   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think\n   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon\n   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his\n   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back\n   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're\n   human beings.\n \n \n   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or\n   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me\n   leave the room. She was like, \"I can't see you right now. Leave the room.\n   You're so much like your dad. Leave.\" It really affected her. I get it.\n \n \n  "
