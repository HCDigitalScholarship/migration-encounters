  "text":"Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is\n   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I\n   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.\n   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.\n   I think the problem with human beings is that you\u2019re your only true enemy.\n   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you\n   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,\n   sniffles].\n \n \n   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.\n   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid\n   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because\n   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't\n   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get\n   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].\n   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.\n \n \n   Luisa: I remember I had a personal project that I was supposed to work on\n   my entire year. I did that in three days. The day I was supposed to learn\n   to sculpt, I learned to sculpt [Pause] in thirty minutes and then\n   [Chuckles] I sculpted something\u2014a huge tiger\u2014and I turned it in and it was\n   one of the top. There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one\n   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still\n   not a challenge. So I started doing extracurriculars.\n \n \n  "
