I wasn't one who was looking to commit a crime or\n cause that kind of conflict or attention. I think it was a bigger deal for\n my parents. I do remember them saying that we had to behave properly, or we\n had to take care of how we were behaving to avoid the cops or to avoid the\n police. But it wasn't something that I would say, I think, I would be\n intimidated of their figure, but more on my parents\u2019 account than my own.\n      \n      \n"
