  "text":"So you've been to the\n   United States twice?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: And the first time you went as a middle schooler?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Was that hard to all of a sudden leave your country?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes, because of the situation. Because my parents split up, and then\n   I didn't know what's going on. And then once I was over there I didn't know\n   any English. So the first year was hard also because when I went there, I\n   had to go back one year from school because I did not know English. And\n   then third year, the things that they teach at the bilingual classes, it\n   was not on the grade that I was, it was below that. So I think that, that\n   got me, I lost interest in school because of that. So I started hanging out\n   with bad people and stuff like that.\n \n \n  "
