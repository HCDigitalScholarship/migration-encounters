  "text":"Isabel: Yeah. That makes sense. And a lot of people mention fear of driving\n because if they they drive without a license, but probably weren't as much\n in New York or...\n      \n      \n Ana: No, or at least from... I don't remember how old I was, but my dad did\n get a car. And so he would try to teach us to drive, my sisters and myself.\n I don't recall it being an issue, trying to get a driver's license. I think\n as I got older, I realized that it could have been a conflict, but I think\n that he always looked into what state would be giving the driving...\n Because I didn't know until I was older that only certain states provide\n that. And so he would find it and he would go for it. But living in a city\n like New York, it wasn't a necessity, having a car to move around and such,\n it was more of what my dad wanted in life. So that's what he got.\n      \n      \n"
