A lot of\n   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to\n   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think\n   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the\n   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you\n   have more opportunities, they treat you different.\n \n \n  "
