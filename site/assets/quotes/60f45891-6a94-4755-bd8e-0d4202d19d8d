  "text":"Anne: How far did you get in school?\n \n \n   Carolina: I was going into 10th whenever I came back.\n \n \n   Anne: I see. When you were in school, did you do well in school?\n \n \n   Carolina: I was, but then I got sick again and they never... Oh, the\n   doctors didn't know what was wrong with me, so I missed... We're in school\n   like nine months, right? I was in school for two months on all the school\n   cycle.\n \n \n   Anne: Which grade?\n \n \n   Carolina: Eighth.\n \n \n   Anne: And what was wrong with you then? Do you know?\n \n \n   Carolina: The doctors couldn't find what was wrong with me. They'd be like,\n   \"Oh, no, well, you don't have anything.\" They ran tests, they did this,\n   they did that, and they couldn't find what was wrong with me.\n \n \n   Anne: And eventually you got better.\n \n \n   Carolina: Yes and no. I still suffer from stomach pains. My head will\n   constantly hurt, really strong migraines, but they're not migraines at the\n   same time. And my bones will hurt at times. I can't move. So it's really\n   weird. And they don't know what it is.\n \n \n  "
