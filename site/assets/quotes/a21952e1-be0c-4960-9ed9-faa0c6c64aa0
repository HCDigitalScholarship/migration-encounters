  "text":"Isabel: So, just to start, a couple questions, for the reasons for\n migration. I know we covered in the survey, but just like reiterating what\n motivated your family to migrate from Mexico to the US.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Well, it was really to the point that my dad wasn't doing anything\n productive here in Mexico. We were staying in a one-bedroom house with my\n grandpa, it was all of us, it was a really small room. My mom spent a lot\n of time being depressed, my dad was an alcoholic, and my mom literally told\n him, \"I'm leaving. And you can come or not.\" So yeah, it was basically for\n a better life for me and my mom, my siblings, and that's the reason that we\n went to Mexico.\n      \n      \n"
