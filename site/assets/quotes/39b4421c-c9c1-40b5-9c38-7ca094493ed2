You weren't given the chance to fight your case or\n   anything?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yes, I was, but I didn't want to.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah. Why was that? Just didn't want to spend that much time in\n   detention or anything?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah. Yeah, because I would see a lot of people that they'd be\n   fighting their case and they would be in jail for a year. And then after\n   that, they'd still get deported. So might as well just deport me right\n   away. I don't want to spend a lot of time just here, so that at the end you\n   can just go and deport me anyways.\n \n \n  "
