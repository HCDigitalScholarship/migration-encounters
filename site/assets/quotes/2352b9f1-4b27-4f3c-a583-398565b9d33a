I'm not going to take my son away from her because she's been so\n   nice, but I'm not going to sign that you know [laughs]? So I mean, it's\n   just a nightmare for everybody. It's just not right. We don't go to steal\n   nobody's jobs. We go to have a better life. That's it. And we are very\n   hardworking people. So I don't know what's going to happen.\n \n \n  "
