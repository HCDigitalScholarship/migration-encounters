  "text":"Yair: Then my dad, he said that he wanted to come back too, because my mom\n   wanted to come back over there, but then she saw all her family after nine\n   years and stuff. She said that she ... It was my decision if I wanted to\n   stay. I was like, well, I did want to stay because I wanted to graduate\n   from high school, but then she's like, \"No, I just want you guys to come\n   back here.\" My dad took the decision to just come back over here. We drove\n   all the way over here, and he took the car and trailer. We actually took\n   all of our stuff from home for all the way over here. We took our kitchen,\n   our living room.\n \n \n  "
