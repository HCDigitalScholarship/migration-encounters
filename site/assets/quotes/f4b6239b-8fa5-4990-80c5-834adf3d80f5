It\u2019s the hardest at\n   night\u2014just knowing that you used to sleep everyday with them in your bed.\n   And just when you're alone in that bed, just thinking about everything,\n   that's when it really hits you. It just like bop right in the face. But\n   other than that, Mexico has been good to me. I\u2019ve gotten blessed with that\n   job.\n \n \n  "
