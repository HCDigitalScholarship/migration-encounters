  "text":"Many: One day, I went back home, and her cousin tell me, \"You know what? I\n   don't want to tell you this, but your wife is with this guy in his house\n   because we saw the car.\u201d They saw the car at this guy's house. I got mad\n   and got sad because I can't... That happened because I never have time to\n   solve the problem. After that, I went to this guy's house and I pulled up\n   my truck and started kicking the doors because I know she was in there\n   because her car was on that place. So, I started kicking doors and\n   everything. When I break into the house, I saw them, those guys on the bed.\n   So it was kind of a shock for me to see something like that. I was thinking\n   to just go away and not doing nothing, that happened in my mind, that\n   person in my mind. But then when I see this guy is laughing in front of me,\n   I don't know, it made me mad. It made me so mad. So I started hurting him.\n   I started fighting with him. After that, she jumped on me too. She started\n   hitting me too, and I was fighting with her and then with him at the same\n   time.\n \n \n   Many: Every time when she was pulling my hair or when she was slapping me,\n   I was feeling like this relationship is just\u2026 I mean, it's over. It's done.\n   We're never going to fix something like this. I can do nothing to fix this\n   right now. By that point, I can't. What happened, I just leave them and I\n   walk away. Like I was telling you, as soon as I closed the door, police was\n   there just waiting for me outside. So I started talking with one of the\n   police officer and we were just having a good conversation because I\n   explained to them the situation. My wife, she was cheating on me. Well, the\n   thing is the police officer can't help. They had to take me to jail because\n   I committed crimes. I went to jail"
