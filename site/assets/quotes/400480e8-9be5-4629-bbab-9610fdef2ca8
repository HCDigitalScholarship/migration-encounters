  "text":"Anne: Sometimes we ask people just to reflect on some patterns, or ideas\n   related to deportees and I was wondering, you like many young men you came\n   over with kids and growing up in the States for whatever reason end up\n   getting in trouble. Why do you think that is, that it's such a prevalent\n   pattern?\n \n \n   Mike: I feel like it has a lot to do with you realizing that it's not like\n   people say, because in America you're taught to believe if you really want\n   something you could achieve it. And when you realize that that doesn't\n   apply to you, that's what I feel like that's the big spiral down that you\n   go to.\n \n \n   Mike: Once you realize that it's not really how you were taught to believe,\n   or not for you in that case, I feel like a lot of kids just give up and\n   lose hope, because it's already hard as it is. Not being able to get a job\n   and still trying to do things right without breaking the law. And then when\n   you realize it's never going to change for you, man, you just like,\n   \"Whatever. Okay.\" Or, \"If I can't get it like this, I'm going to get it\n   like that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And a lot of thing is survival too. A lot of people have to survive.\n   A lot of people don't have the luxury of being able to get up, go to work\n   every day. A lot of people wish that they had a job. Would kill to just get\n   up early and just get that paycheck. I know a lot of families that they\n   have to go through the most, but they still do it, because they have to.\n   They have no choice. And it's way better than here. And I didn't understand\n   that until now.\n \n \n  "
