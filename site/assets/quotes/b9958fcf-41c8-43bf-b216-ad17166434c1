  "text":"Oh, yeah. I think of myself as Mexican, but I do love America. United\nStates, because we are in America here. I always consider myself as being a\nMonrovian, Californian. I mean, I paid my taxes, I went to school there. I\ngrew up there. I guess it's not where you're born, it's where you were\nraised. I love this place though too.

I lived in Huntington Beach,\" or \"I lived in Long Beach.\" \"Oh,\nis that right? Oh man, I lived in Monrovia.\" Become friends. That's why I\nstill speak English. I mean, I don't lose my\u2014\n      \n      "
