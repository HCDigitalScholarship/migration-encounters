  "text":"But I said, \"No. I have to go.\" [Cries] I\u2019m sorry. So I left and I came\n   here, and my grandma was waiting for me in the airport - she called me.\n   She's like, \"Do you see me?\" But I'd never ever seen how she looked, not\n   even in a picture. So I got into the airport and I was like, \"Where are\n   you? I can't find you,\" and she said, \"I don't see you either.\" She was\n   right in front of me, literally [Laughs], and I said, \"Oh.\" And she's like,\n   \"I have blonde hair and I have a red shirt and jeans on. Can you find me?\"\n   And I was like, \"Oh my goodness! It was the lady just in front of me.\u201d\n \n \n  "
