They all start with the letter A and at the time I only had three.\n   So, I only have three stars because they're going to be stars. And I did\n   them on my eyes because they're always going to be in my sight. So just\n   three stars. They're my stars. And like, all my kids start with the letter\n   A.\n \n \n  "
