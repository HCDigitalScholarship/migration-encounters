  "text":"actually like\n   sports. I was in wrestling, and soccer, always soccer but I was more into\n   wrestling. And so I did wrestling. I have a picture of my trophy here in\n   Mexico. And I have my picture here.\n \n \n   Anne: It\u2019s hard.\n \n \n   Miguel: I have a lot of things here. I enjoy working on cars. My very first\n   car was a Chrysler. And I remember installing a stereo. I remember washing\n   my car. Things like that, that I wish I had here."
