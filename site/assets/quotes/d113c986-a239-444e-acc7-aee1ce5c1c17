Who are you looking for? Are you trying to\n connect stuff, are you trying to find somebody with some type of substance\n or something?\" Like no, I'm just trying to find the street here. I don't\n know where I'm at. Most of these streets don't even have names. They're\n covered or they're blocked by little taco stands. That's not bad.\n      \n      \n"
