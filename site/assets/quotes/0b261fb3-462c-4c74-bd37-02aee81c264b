  "text":"Sergio: Have you always known that you were undocumented?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Have I always known that I was undocumented? When I was younger,\n   when my mother and I arrived to Chicago, I remember my aunts telling her,\n   \"Don't go out that much. Stay indoors, because if they see you, they can\n   take you.\" I'm at a very young age, at that point, I think I was six or\n   seven. Adults are talking in the room and you hear them tell your mom,\n   \"Don't go out that much. If they see you out there, they're gonna grab\n   you.\" I thought like, \u201cWhoa, who's gonna grab us, who's gonna grab mom?\u201d I\n   didn't understand the concept of the legal side of migration. Why we're not\n   supposed to be here. I'd never quite fully understood why I wasn't supposed\n   to be there.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Until finally, one time my stepdad, he told me, \"You need to go to\n   school and do everything that you need to do, because we're not supposed to\n   be here.\" I asked him, \"Why not, why can't we be here?\" He told me, \"We're\n   immigrants, we come from a different country. You weren't born here, I\n   wasn't born here, and this isn't our country. People don't want us here\n   because they say we take their jobs. Or they have a preconceived image of\n   what an immigrant is.\" I still didn't understand it yet, I didn't know why.\n   You go to work, you pay your taxes, you do everything as my American\n   parent's friends do.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Everybody... I go to their house and, yeah, they have big \u2018ol\n   houses and mansions and stuff like that, but at the end of the day, they go\n   to work, they have a job. I don't see you out here stealing or doing\n   anything, you're not causing any harm. Why can't we be here? He told us,\n   \"Well, I mean, that's just the way things are.\" I didn't understand that\n   until obviously I grew up and then I found that out. When I finally really,\n   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was\n   the day that\u2014I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the\n   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I\n   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my\n   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, \"Can I\n   go?\" She's like, \"No you can't.\" I'm like, \"Why?\" \"Because you can't fly.\"\n   I'm like, \"Why can't I fly?\" She said, \"Because you don't have a state ID,\n   you're not from here.\" I'm like, \"Damn.\" Then, I think she told the\n   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,\n   \"Damn, this shit is real, this is real.\" Then after that I just, \"Okay,\n   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.\" Yeah, that's around the\n   time I found out.\n \n \n  "
