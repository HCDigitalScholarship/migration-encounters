  "text":"Anne: And how did you learn English?\n      \n      \n Ben: How did I learn English? English, when my father was working at\n the horse stables of course I grew up around it because the owners of the\n stables, they would talk to us in English and they would give us candies,\n they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he\n had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have\n my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be\n able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's\n the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to\n learn, was that little recording machine.\n      \n      \n"
