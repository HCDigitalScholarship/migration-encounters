  "text":"Do you consider yourself Mexican or American? American\n   like United States.\n \n \n   Weco: Mexican.\n \n \n   Isabel: Mexican? Why is that?\n \n \n   Weco: It's in my blood. It's running through my veins. If I wasn't Mexican,\n   they wouldn't talk about, \"Oh, you gotta get deported.\" It's in my veins. I\n   always say I'm Mexican. I'm proud of it. I love it. It's in my veins. We're\n   the shit. We're the shit. This is the way I look at it. Where I was at in\n   the States, a lot of construction workers, a lot of working places outside,\n   any type of hard work was really us. Really us. Hot sun, any type of thing,\n   it's us. Also, drug wise, it's us. We're out there. We're both ways.\n \n \n   Isabel: You are really honest.\n \n \n   Weco: I'm just being honest. We're both ways, and Mexico is known for that.\n   A lot of good people, working people, and then there's drug people. They've\n   got both."
