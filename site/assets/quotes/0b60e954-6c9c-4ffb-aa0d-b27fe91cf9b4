  "text":"Brenda: We started the immigration process when I was fourteen, I think. My\n aunt adopted us, she is a US citizen, and the whole thing was supposed to\n be super easy peasy. She adopted my brother and I, and legally we lived\n with her because she lived across the street\u2014we lived with my parents, but\n she was across the street and formally she was our parent. It was supposed\n to be like, \u201cHere, you're her daughter and you get papers right away.\u201d It\n was not that simple or easy. Our attorney just said, \"You do have to leave\n the US\" and I was like, \"But when?\" I was already eighteen. I was like,\n \"When?\" It's like, \u201cOh, I don't know.\u201d No one ever included me in the\n process of what had to be done. So, I had to look it up myself and see at\n eighteen and I don't know how many days old, your time starts counting as\n an illegal alien. I was like, \"All right. So, no one's checked on this. I\n have months till I have to leave.\u201d\n      \n      \n"
