  "text":"Jesus: Well, I want to visit here in Mexico first because I heard there's a\n lot of nice beaches and a lot of super nice places to go to. The forest and\n pyramids and stuff. I've been to a few, but I want to go to a lot more.\n Then after that, I want to go to Canada, so I could study. I want to be a\n pilot.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Cool. So, you want to go to school for that in Canada?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, because out here, it's super expensive. It's like two million\n pesos.\n      \n      \n"
