It's working.\n   The thing that you not able to leave the country, you get used to it, like,\n   \u201cOh, it's just Mexico.\u201d I was just playing. To be honest, I would never\n   come back. I would never come back if I wouldn't have deported, so that's\n   one positive thing about the deportation. I got to know my country, my\n   culture. Got to spend more time with my family. If it wouldn\u2019t have been\n   like that, I would never have come to Mexico. Yeah, I think all the people\n   that leave Mexico and emigrate to the US, we do the same thing. \u201cOkay, next\n   year, I'm going to go to Mexico.\u201d The year goes by, and the year go by.\n   \u201cOkay, in two years, I'm going to try to save my money and I'm going to\n   Mexico.\u201d The two years go by, and it just goes by, goes by, it goes by, it\n   goes by. It's just like that.\n \n \n  "
