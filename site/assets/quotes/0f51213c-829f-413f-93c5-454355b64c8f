  "text":"Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and\n   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.\n   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the\n   sea, to the bay.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On\n   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of\n   July. We would make some Mexican food.\n \n \n  "
