  "text":"Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them\n   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they\n   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him\n   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from\n   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't\n   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just\n   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.\n \n \n  "
