  "text":"Olimpya: My first year of high school, I almost finished it, but my mom\n   decided to come back. She said that it was time. I was like, \"It's your\n   time, not mine. You can leave.\" [Laughs]. Yeah, but she said that she\n   didn't want to be there anymore. Since I was underage, so I had to grab my\n   stuff. It was kind of the same way that we came. One day, she was talking\n   on the phone. Then she woke me up and said, \"We're leaving.\"\n \n \n   Anita: So again\u2014\n \n \n   Olimpya: We start all over.\n \n \n   Anita: All over again.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: How old were you?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Around fifteen?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. It was hard because I don't know if it's a lot of years that\n   I lived there or not, but I had a life. I had friends. I had family. I had\n   school. My life was there. I didn't know anything about here in Mexico. I\n   know I was born here, and it's my country, and it has nice things, but,\n   hey, it's not my house.\n \n \n  "
