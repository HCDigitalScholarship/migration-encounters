  "text":"Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's\n a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when\n you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to\n explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure\n that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the\n word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my\n mom trying to ask, \u201cWhat's wrong with her? What can they do?\u201d Doctors just\n going, \"She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's\n it.\" Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just\n kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the\n hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.\n It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was\n okay, it was mostly of, \"What's going on with you right now?\" \"I'm bleeding\n out.\" And doctors going, \"Are you having an abortion? Are you\u2026\"\u2014A\n miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion\u2014and it was just hard at that time\n because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was\n still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there\n was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being\n able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You\n can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be\n there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that\n it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.\n      \n      \n"
