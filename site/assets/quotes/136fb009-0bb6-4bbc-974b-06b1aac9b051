  "text":"Anita: You were angry?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free\n   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at\n   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.\n   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some\n   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help\n   them out. And when they try like right now\u2026. I mean, Donald Trump really\n   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We\n   can't get them back. That's it.\n \n \n   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.\n \n \n   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,\n   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, \"How are\n   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's\n   going to happen?\" No one asks. They're just like, \"Oh, well, you don't\n   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.\" That's how\n   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them\n   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that\n   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really\n   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.\n   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the\n   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American\n   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, \"Wow,\n   congratulations. You deserve it.\" Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't\n   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We\n   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think\n   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get\n   treated that way. I just don't believe it.\n \n \n  "
