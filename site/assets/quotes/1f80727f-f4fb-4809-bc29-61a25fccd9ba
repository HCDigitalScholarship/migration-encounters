I was 18, and I said to myself, \"If you have this one dream,\n   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be\n   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.\" So, I just\n   said, \"Okay, I'm going to leave.\" And I left my parents and my brother, and\n   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.\n \n \n  "
