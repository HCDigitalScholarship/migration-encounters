[first me, next me, and last me] So everybody's like, yo\n   te chingo a ti antes de que tu me chingas a mi. [ I\u2019ll fuck you before you\n   can fuck me] You can speak to any Mexican and that's basically their\n   mentality. And I'm not like that. I'm like, \"I'll help you, hoy por mi,\n   manana por ti.\u201d [today from me, tomorrow from you] So I'll help you today\n   and I expect, or I hope, that you help me tomorrow. So, that's one thing.\n \n \n  "
