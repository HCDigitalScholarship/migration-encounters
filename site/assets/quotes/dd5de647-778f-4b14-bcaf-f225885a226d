  "text":"I guess I grew up more with my grandma because she would go and come back.\n   During summer, I would stay with my grandma more. Yeah, I did see my father\n   a lot. Mostly my father. My mom was the one that was more time at her job\n   because she became a supervisor of a company, so she had to be there most\n   of the time. My father was just a construction worker so after a certain\n   time, he can't work anymore because of the light. I grew up with my father\n   a lot. My sister and I, he would take us to the park, take us swimming. I\n   don't feel like I missed them too much. I always felt that we were a\n   family. No, I don't think I got that experience. I do know of other friends\n   that their parents were at work all day and he was by himself at the house.\n   I was like, \"Hey, just come over here. You can come play at my house.\" We\n   had a trampoline and everything.\n \n \n  "
