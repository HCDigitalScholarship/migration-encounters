  "text":"I've been to a lot of call centers, a lot. Tell me about it, you can ask me\n     about the call centers, the things I\u2019ve done, the accounts. I've been to a\n     MasterCard, Kohls, I've even sold packages for cable TV, all those things.\n     You get to learn too. That's one of the advantages because you're learning\n     too, because you're managing money, people's money, you actually get to\n     know. I mean, on my end, that's what I've learned. I don't talk bad about\n     the call centers. I learned a lot. I never, well, in the States I never had\n     a credit card due to the fact that I was an illegal immigrant. But here I\n     have been managing people's credit cards, and it's like, \"Oh, I didn't know\n     about this.\" I mean, right now I'm in a call center where you lease phones.\n     I was surprised about leasing phones. I never heard about leasing phones. I\n     heard about leasing TVs, leasing cars, but phones?\n \n \n    "
