  "text":"Isabel: Well, if there's anything else you'd like to add, or you want\n   people to know before we wrap up?\n \n \n   Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave\n   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, \"Don't even\n   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're\n   still going to be here.\" So, it was like, \u201cThat's nice advice for my first\n   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.\u201d So, I\n   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, \u201cWhat's the point?\n   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.\u201d?\n \n \n   Isabel: Not allowing yourself to get attached.\n \n \n   Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, \"What's the\n   point?\" For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't\n   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was\n   full of other migrants, so he was like, \"No, there's no gringos coming out\n   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something\n   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to\n   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.\"\n   That was like, \"Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?\" \"No.\n   No, no, no, no, no.\" So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here\n   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go.
