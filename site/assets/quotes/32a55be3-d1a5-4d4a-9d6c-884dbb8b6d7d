  "text":"Just from the steps of\n mourning, right? Acceptance, denial. Or I don't even know them in order,\n but for a whole long time, it was just denial and then acceptance and now\n really just flourishing into it.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And mourning, mourning your life in the US or?\n      \n      \n Ana: Mourning, I think more than anything, the loss of familiarity. I don't\n really remember my childhood to be honest. When I grew up here, I remember\n my grandparents and that's about it. So also adapting here in that sense,\n was really weird. People going up to you and going, \"Oh, I remember when\n you were so small.\" You would think that someone would appreciate that. You\n would think that, \"Hey, that's cute.\" And for me, because of the attitude\n that I had, for me it was just like, it was annoying. And it was like,\n \"You're a stranger to me. Why are you telling me about you knowing me, you\n don't know me.\" So, again, it was just really negative despite having\n people going to me and talking to me about my parents or talking to me\n about what they remember about my childhood. For me, it was not a welcome\n thing. So, it was, yeah. So, it was a mourning of the loss of familiarity.\n      \n      \n"
