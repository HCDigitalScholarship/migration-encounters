  "text":"I made the decision of returning, and I uprooted my sisters. My\n   little sister was a year old when we left. She knew nothing about Mexico.\n   She barely spoke Spanish, so I selfishly made everyone move back to Mexico.\n \n \n   Anita: Because?\n \n \n   Luisa: Because I wanted to continue my education.\n \n \n   Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?\n \n \n   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by\n   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so\n   she's like, \"Okay. That's okay.\" Eventually my sisters are going to have to\n   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much\n   when it comes down to it."
