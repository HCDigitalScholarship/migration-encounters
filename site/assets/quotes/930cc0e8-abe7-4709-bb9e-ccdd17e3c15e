Then we headed for the airport. That took us to TJ. Then from there,\n they crossed us over.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Did you drive across the border or walk across?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Well, they separated me and my mom. When we got to TJ, they were\n like, \"Your mom's going to go another place, and you're going to come with\n the guy that I was going to cross with, whatever.\u201d So, I went with him in\n his truck and we just crossed like nothing, no border.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: What did you think about it at the time? I know you were young, but\n do you remember\u2014\n      \n      \n Jesus: I wasn't really scared. But everything was different, I didn't know\n what the hell was going on. But I wasn't scared, I was just curious. I'm\n like, \u201cWhat's going on? What the hell are we doing"
