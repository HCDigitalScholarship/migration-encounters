But the problem was I had two phones. I had just\n bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give\n away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They\n caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, \"Why do\n you have two phones?\" Like thought I stole one. I'm like, \"No, I didn't.\n All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.\"\n      \n      \n"
