  "text":"Juan: As a community, we always do wrong. When I was in the US, we had\n   Bernie. I love Bernie, I wish he would have been president, but they chose\n   Hillary instead, and Hillary lost against Trump. Then I come to Mexico, and\n   we had all hopes that this new government was going to do positive things.\n   He is making a change, but it's going downhill right now. My long-term goal\n   is to be able to change the way people view things, because Mexicans can be\n   selfish, they can be ignorant.\n \n \n   Juan: That's because that's how they were taught since they were little.\n   What I want to do is change Mexico and take out all the potential that we\n   have, because we have so much potential, we just don't do it, so does the\n   US. The US has so much potential, one of the top ones with the potential,\n   but because of right now with the leaders that we have, we're not able to\n   provide it. Then again, I guess that's overall as a society. We want to\n   change this, let's change this or change that, but we can't, because the\n   person who is ruling is not going to \u2026 They have other things in priority.\n \n \n   Anne: Maybe you'll be a president.\n \n \n   Juan: I want to be president, but I want to make a change [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anne: That's great. Well, thank you very much.\n \n \n   Juan: Yeah, no prob"
