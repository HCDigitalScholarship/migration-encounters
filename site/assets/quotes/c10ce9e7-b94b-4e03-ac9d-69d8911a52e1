They didn't want to take the charge. But\n   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return\n   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was\n   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too\n   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just\n   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.\n \n \n  "
