  "text":"Anita: So what's been the hardest thing about being back?\n \n \n   Diana: That you don't make enough money. Actually, probably that's why I\n   like the more over there because even with low salary income, you still, if\n   you know how to manage and everything, you still ... I know that over there\n   the situation, it'll be you're poor, but you don't live that bad, you don't\n   struggle that much. And here, it's hard to find a job that pays good, the\n   hours are way longer, and then you have to travel sometimes a lot more.\n   Let's say I do, it's not that bad, but I make like an hour and 15 minutes\n   from here to my house so it's not that bad. But in other ones I would make\n   more than two hours, and then it's far and then you go in the subway with a\n   lot of people standing there.\n \n \n  "
