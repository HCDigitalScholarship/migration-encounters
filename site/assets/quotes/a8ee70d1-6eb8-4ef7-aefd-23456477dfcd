  "text":"Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad\n still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had\n to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending\n because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left\n alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many\n times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or\n I would have a friend that said, \"Let's go do this,\" I'll be, \"No, I'm\n going to get in trouble.\" Or, \"No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from\n here.\" And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had\n Chicanos\u2014which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that\n were born there\u2014and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was\n always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, \"Oh I\n have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.\" And so that was\n very, very, very difficult for me.\n      \n      \n"
