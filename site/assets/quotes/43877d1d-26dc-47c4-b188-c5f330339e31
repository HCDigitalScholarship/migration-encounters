  "text":"Donovan: How the world wants you to be. How they raise you. What is good or\n   bad? Actually, I have it on the book on my phone. Each time when I get\n   depressed and stuff like that. It's a mental process. I really recommend\n   that book. Actually, I have it on my phone, so I can share it to every\n   person I am able to give it out to. There was a point in my life where the,\n   the substance abuse had just taken over my brain, and I was going\n   schizophrenic. I was diagnosed as being bipolar. My teacher, the one that\n   that's always been with me my whole life, locked me up in a mental\n   institution and she gave me the book to read. That book saved my life. And\n   it saved my life so many times from doing stupid shit. And it's a really\n   mind opener. Really mind blowing.\n \n \n  "
