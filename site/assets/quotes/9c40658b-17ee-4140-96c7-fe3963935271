  "text":"Mike: They took me downstairs, checked me, and then they let me go. But\n   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next\n   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.\n   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I\n   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out\n   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going\n   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.\n \n \n  "
