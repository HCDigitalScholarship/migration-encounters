  "text":"Anita: And do you ever think about him going back to the States?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. Last week ... I have another daughter.\n \n \n   Anita: Yes. I remember.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I don't know if you ever remember that I told you. She's going to\n   be 17 already next year, so she didn't talk to me at all before. She\n   started talking to me last Sunday. She was like, \"You know what? I want to\n   go and visit you guys.\" And I'm like, \"Great.\" Well, I was happy. It\u2019s\n   something that I would never expect. First of all, I never expect that\n   phone call at all. Second of all, when she says, \"Well, I want to see you\n   guys,\" and I'm like, \"I want to see you, too, Mija, but we had to wait for\n   you to get the passport and everything.\" I know it's going to be a process\n   and you know everything will cost money, but I will make it. Probably next\n   year, she will be here, at least for a couple weeks, no?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: But, yes, I want him to get the passport and everything so he can\n   go, too. Later on, I want to see if I could get my visa, just to go and\n   visit them or just to take him to visit and so he will be able to know his\n   country. Because, believe it or not, he wants to go and see. Sometimes he,\n   like in the school, sometimes he gets racismo. I don't like it. I want him\n   to go over there, too.\n \n \n  "
