  "text":"Zayuri: [Laughs]. I was like, \"Why does that upset you that much? We're not\n   even talking about you, Cynthia. Why do you take it personal?\" [Emphasis].\n   She was like really mad about it. I remember that once she told the\n   principal that we were molesting her in the sense that we were annoying.\n   \"She's so annoying. She's constantly talking about all the other girls.\" I\n   was like, \"We don't even mention their names. How did you figure out that?\"\n   It was really confusing for me. Why do you think that we're speaking about\n   you when we don't even mention your name? And I never confronted her, to be\n   honest, because I am not that kind of people. I know that I should have\n   confronted her and be like, \"What is your problem with me? Can we make\n   something about it?\" but it was too much for me. One day she will get tired\n   of it. She didn't.\n \n \n  "
