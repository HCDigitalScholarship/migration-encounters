  "text":"Zayuri: It's annoying definitely because it downgrades you. It's like\n   you're not enough for anyone apparently. Especially in my family, they\n   treat you like\u2014they don't even want to listen to it. For example, my\n   grandma, the one that is here, she's so annoyed by the whole thing. She\n   thinks that all the family that went to the United States and came back ...\n   She's like, \"Ugh, now they think that they have seen the whole world, and\n   now they think that they're better than us.\" It's like, \"Okay. So, I can't\n   even talk to you about this, right?\" And don't even try to mention that you\n   miss something about the United States, because she's going to be like,\n   \"Well, go right there. Go back. What are you doing in here?\" I was like,\n   \"Yeah, that's the same thing that I question.\"\n \n \n  "
