  "text":"Luis: Well, while I was in high school, the overall feeling that I got from\n   my counselor was that \u201cHe's Mexican and he's lucky if he graduates.\u201d Right?\n   So I didn't even know what an SAT [Scholastic Aptitude Test] was. And then\n   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to\n   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And\n   thankfully I met a guy from, a Puerto Rican guy, from this community\n   college and he told me, \"You know what, you can do your general ed and then\n   you can decide on studying something.\u201d He just approached me, and he was really\n   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and\n   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California\n   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.\n \n \n   Anne: Okay.\n \n \n   Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really\n   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per\n   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre\n   education.\n \n \n  "
