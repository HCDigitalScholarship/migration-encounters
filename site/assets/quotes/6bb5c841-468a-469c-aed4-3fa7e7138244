  "text":"Anne: What do you think the Mexican government should be doing to better\n integrate return migrants?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, I think that there should be a program where returning\n migrant\u2026Well, one, there should be at least some type of assistance, get\n them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of\n origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers\n to hire new arrivals.\n      \n      \n Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of\n assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in\n monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the\n things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take\n 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't\n have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they\n have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out\n of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're\n dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's\n shelters, but them shelters are full.\n      \n      \n"
