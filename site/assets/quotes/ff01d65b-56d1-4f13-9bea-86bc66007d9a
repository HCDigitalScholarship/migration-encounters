I don't\n   even know how to start to learn English because I have Mexican people right\n   beside me and they didn't help me out. They didn't help me out. They didn't\n   let me know what there was saying. It was pretty difficult. But once I\n   start to learn English, well to start understanding just a little bit, I\n   just got involved to it.\n \n \n  "
