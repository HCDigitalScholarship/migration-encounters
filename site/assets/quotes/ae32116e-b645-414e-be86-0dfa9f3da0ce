They would call me \u201cillegal Mexican.\u201d So I took\n   that as a positive thing and said, \"Yes, I am,\" and I felt like I needed to\n   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because\n   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United\n   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to\n   represent them."
