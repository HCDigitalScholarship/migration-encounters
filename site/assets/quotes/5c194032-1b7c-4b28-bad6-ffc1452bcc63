I knew I was undocumented probably my\n   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things\n   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family\n   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.\n   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good\n   stories from him. [Laughs]\n \n \n   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me\u2014and I mean\n   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every\n   single day at her home or her grandparents\u2019 home. If my mom couldn't find\n   me, she'd call L___\u2019s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my\n   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, \"Hey. Could you\n   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have\n   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.\" All family events I\n   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.\n   We were best friends.\n \n \n  "
