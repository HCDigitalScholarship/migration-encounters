  "text":"Ilse: But the other company's director, he saw how pushy I was, how\n   dedicated I was\u2014I mean, I'm talking about, the normal hours to come into\n   work were at nine, and I signed my contract to go from nine to four, but I\n   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I\n   was calling, prospecting, and everything. And he saw my dedication, and\n   three months after my hiring, he offered me a position at the inspections\n   company. And that was just life-changing because after that, he obviously\n   raised my salary.\n \n \n   Ilse: He is an amazing boss. He's still my boss until today. After a year\n   and a half, been with both, the fusion of the company, he decides to\n   separate. So, we went from being the company department to being a company.\n   So, I've been able to help him out with the whole... from logo, from\n   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm\n   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice\n   already. I travel in Mexico City so much. I've met so many people, the\n   China chamber, the Mexico City chamber, so many important organizations, so\n   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're\n   trying to do services for them.\n \n \n   Ilse: And it was just so amazing. Everything happens for a reason. I know\n   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little\n   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's\n   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.\n   And I just want to tell people and help them understand that we don't have\n   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that\n   they're missing out! [Laughs]. Because I could have done all this for a\n   company that is based over there, but obviously, well, that was impossible,\n   so I'm here.\n \n \n  "
