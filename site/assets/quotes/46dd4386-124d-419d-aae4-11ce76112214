  "text":"oana: Maybe, because a lot people think of investing in the United States,\n   so once they leave, they're going to invest in Mexico. I think a lot of\n   investments.\n \n \n   Anita: As a person, what do you bring?\n \n \n   Joana: Your freedom, you gain your freedom to be honest. You're not afraid\n   here. You're not afraid of anyone coming up to you and saying, \"Oh, you're\n   a wetback. Oh, you don't belong here.\" Because this is your country. I\n   think, as a person, you gain calmness. You don't have to be afraid anymore,\n   but then again, you kind of don't want to be in Mexico because of all the\n   corruption.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you think you could help change that corruption in Mexico because\n   of your experience growing up in the States?\n \n \n   Joana: I think if we all join forces, we could change everything. It's only\n   if you put your mind to it. You can change a lot of things. It's not going\n   to take a day, but eventually it will happen. If all of us join together\n   and work together, we can change a lot of things in Mexico.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you think the deported migrants, if you all join together you can\n   change something?\n \n \n   Joana: Definitely. There's a lot of people here that got deported. A lot.\n   Day after day it's the same thing. Pretty much the same reasons. Either\n   they got stopped at work, a raid, you name it, but it's pretty much the\n   same reasons that we come back.\n \n \n  "
