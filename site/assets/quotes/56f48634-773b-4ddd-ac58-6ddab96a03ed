My mother did not allow us to talk about it.\n   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty\n   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I\n   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science\n   Facility\u2014research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in\u2014I'm not\n   sure what kind of testing they're doing there\u2014[Chuckles] but they ask you\n   if you're an American citizen or not.\n \n \n  "
