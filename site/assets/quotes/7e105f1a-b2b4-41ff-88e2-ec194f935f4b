  "text":"Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it\n   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry\n   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with\n   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the\n   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I\n   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a\n   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading\n   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.\n \n \n  "
