  "text":"Angelo: No, it's actually the very first time that I've been able to tell\n this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to\n embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother\u2019s\n Day, Father\u2019s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season\u2014my kids\n literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My\n first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw\n lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying\u2014I\n was staying with my uncles\u2014and I just stared at the lights and just broke\n down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I\n used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park\u2014I\n walk by a pretty park\u2014and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult\n mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to\n say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,\n for all that work to just be taken away just like that.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,\n being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own\n father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from\n that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a\n father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Exactly.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that\n you never wanted to be.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was\n the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me\n and to my family. So, I said \u201cI'm going to be the best father,\u201d and I want\n to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my\n kids right now, they stay with their grandparents\u2014they don't have a father.\n I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are\n they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.\n      \n      \n Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you\n had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,\n socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on\n your return?\n      \n      \n Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent\n the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't\n want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and\n I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, \"Will I get in trouble\n if I walk around the streets with the beer?\" And she said, \"You'll be fine.\n You have two or 300 pesos, right?\" I said, \"Yeah I just came back from the\n United States, I have money.\" \u201cYou'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,\n just give them that and you'll be completely fine. \u201cSo that was the very\n first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my\n family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, \"Okay, well it's in my\n blood. Let's go for it.\" And literally there will be times where I would\n just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice\n and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about\n half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a\n lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.\n      \n      \n Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on\n my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the\n door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just\n literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just\n [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they\n literally\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Who\u2019s everybody?\n      \n      \n Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family\n sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They\n literally said, \u201cYou're not right.\u201d They didn't talk to me too much because\n just them saying \u201cYou're not all right,\u201d it clicked into my head that it\n was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,\n very first time. So I told myself, \"How do you not remember this happening?\n How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What\n did you do?\" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,\n that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United\n States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times\n where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and\n literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,\n that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because\n for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the\n middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around\n the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the\n street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted\n somebody to\u2026you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling\n me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.\n      \n      \n Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,\n and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a\n big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any\n of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there\n she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,\n she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she\n was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.\n So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, \"You know what,\n your son is doing this\" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and\n that's when I said, I told my mom, \"I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my\n father did, so I'm done.\" And that was it. That's when I said, \"I'm not\n going to do this again to my mom.\"\n      \n      \n"
