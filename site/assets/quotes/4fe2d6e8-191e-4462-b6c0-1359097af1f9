And I was mad.\n \n \n   Anita: You didn't do it in the States, but you did it in Mexico.\n \n \n   Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that\n   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, \"Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to\n   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.\" So I hit\n   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't\n   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't\n   do anything to her. I was like, \"I was just defending myself.\" It was like,\n   \"I don't care. You did this.\" \"I did it, but why? You need to look at the\n   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.\n   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're\n   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.\"\n   They didn't care. The principal was like, \"No, you're suspended. You're\n   leaving.\"\n \n \n  "
