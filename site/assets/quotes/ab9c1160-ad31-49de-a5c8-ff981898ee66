  "text":"Anne: And how long have you been back?\n \n \n   Mike: Since October. So like eight, nine months, right? October, November,\n   December.\n \n \n   Anne: So what is it like here?\n \n \n   Mike: I can't say it's been bad, but it's really hard to try to adjust to\n   everything. My kids are the thing that really hits me. It\u2019s the hardest at\n   night\u2014just knowing that you used to sleep everyday with them in your bed.\n   And just when you're alone in that bed, just thinking about everything,\n   that's when it really hits you. It just like bop right in the face."
