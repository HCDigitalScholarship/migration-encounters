  "text":"Anita: Of those occasions immigration never picked, and never gave them to\n   them... Chicago's a sanctuary city.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: No, Chicago's a sanctuary city, yeah. That's why I don't\n   understand why I was picked up. The day I got picked up, I was driving to\n   work. I parked my car and out of nowhere a Ford truck, it was unmarked\n   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,\n   because I even told them all, \"Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do\n   this, is this against my Constitutional rights? I'm not that sure, not that\n   well-educated in that aspect of it, but here, give me a book, I'll read it\n   and I'll tell you what it is. I'm not stupid bro.\" That's why they\n   separated me from the other people I was with, because it wasn't only\n   Mexicans that I was with. I was with somebody from... I was with two\n   Somalians.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: They were brothers actually, two Somalians. I told everybody,\n   \"Man, don't sign anything, don't talk, don't say anything. Just tell them\n   you want a lawyer and that's it.\u201d I remember they told me, \"Shut up,\" and\n   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to\n   sign anything. Yeah, that's what I didn't understand\u2014I didn't understand\n   how they were able to go get me, but as I understood then and now,\n   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws. That's in the\n   door, that's why you still see the dispensary in Colorado get raided,\n   because it's a federal offense, and not state offense. I was literally a\n   federal walking broken law.\n \n \n   Anita: That's sad.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: That's the way I saw it. Even though I'm cool, I'm all right and\n   in Chicago, a sanctuary, but that's only state. They can come and just tear\n   the place up into whatever they want because they're the government. And we\n   can't do anything about it because I'm not from here.\n \n \n   Anita: I'm gonna have to go in another room, can we pause for a second?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, after you were detained, how was your experience? What\n   happened?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: After I was detained, I've got to say my experience going through\n   the immigration, it was something I had never experienced in my life. I\n   mean, I was never deprived of my freedom. And it wasn't because I committed\n   an actual crime. I didn't go and take somebody's laptop, or I didn't go\n   into a store with a loaded gun and ask for money. No, it was one of the\n   most horrible experiences I've ever been through. It was more their idea of\n   housing me because I'm not from there or it was...\n \n \n   Rodolfo: [Pause]. I remember when I first got picked up, they took me to\n   Wisconsin\u2014I'm sorry, they took me to Rock Island, Illinois\u2014for processing.\n   That was the processing center.\n \n \n  "
