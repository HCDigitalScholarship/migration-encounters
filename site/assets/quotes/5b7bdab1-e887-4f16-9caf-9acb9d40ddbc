  "text":"Many: Well, they put me on a detention center in San Antonio, Texas for one\n   month and then after that... They was trying to give me some more time\n   because I just got out of jail. But immigration just tell me, \"You're not\n   going to do any more time. We're going to deport you for twenty years and\n   you can\u2019t come back because if you got caught on the border or something\n   again, we're going to...\" They told me they were going to give me, I think\n   three years or something on jail. And they do, I think they will do"
