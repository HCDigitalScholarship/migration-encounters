  "text":"Anne: That's great. It sounds like you've got great goals and that you'll\n   be able to achieve them. One last question before we end. Do you think\n   there's anything the Mexican government should do to help people coming\n   back from the United States to integrate into society? Are there things\n   that you see that are important to that?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. There's a lot of things that the Mexican government can do.\n   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to\n   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a\n   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,\n   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't\n   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.\n \n \n   Juan: I know New Comienzos helps people who \u2026 Sometimes they do go to the\n   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other\n   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out\n   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had\n   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like\n   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else\n   to help me out.\n \n \n   Juan: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new\n   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with\n   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government\n   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program\n   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't\n   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can\n   have this at home.\n \n \n   Juan: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way\n   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view\n   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things\n   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of\n   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a\n   lot of things that just\u2014 we all see positive things, but with all the\n   corruption here in Mexico, it's hard.\n \n \n   Juan: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or\n   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different\n   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change\n   anything. It's more of a Mexico thing. I guess we're not going so far; we\n   have Trump right now. I'm not sure how you guys feel about Trump. The way I\n   see, we provide power to the wrong people all the time.\n \n \n  "
