  "text":"Isabel: Yeah, yeah. Nice. Could you tell me a bit about\u2026 I guess you said\n   that you had a run-in with the law when you were 12. What happened there?\n \n \n   Weco: Actually, I was 13.\n \n \n   Isabel: Oh, 13.\n \n \n   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we\n   got into some things. Got locked up, and I did some time, came out. And\n   then from when I was 13, that's when everything started. I started going in\n   and out, doing time, till I hit 18.\n \n \n   Isabel: Could you tell me a bit about, I guess, more details in there, like\n   what happened? What do you think caused that?\n \n \n   Weco: Money. When I was 13 I liked money a lot.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: So, the streets called us a lot.\n \n \n   Isabel: What did you like to buy?\n \n \n   Weco: Not even really buy, just... How can I say it? I'm going to just say\n   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first\n   burglary. We broke into a house, stole a lot of things. We got caught for\n   it. After that, since we got placed on probation, that's when it all\n   started."
