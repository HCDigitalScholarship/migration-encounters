  "text":"Pablo: When I started working, I didn't get to hang around with them that\n   much, that\u2019s when I didn't used to work, that\u2019s when I was in school. But\n   there was times, for example, on the weekends and everything, every weekend\n   there would be someone there to pick me up and \"You know what? Let's go do\n   this and that.\"\n \n \n   Isabel: What was this and that?\n \n \n   Pablo: We would just go banging. We would go to the clubs, nightclubs, we\n   would go to the bars, we would go to the parks. And if you see a rival\n   gang, then we would just... Like we say, hit them up.\n \n \n   Isabel: Hit them up. Is that just start a fight?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah. Basically, yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: And that was from 15 years old to...\n \n \n   Pablo: To like 17, 18.\n \n \n  "
