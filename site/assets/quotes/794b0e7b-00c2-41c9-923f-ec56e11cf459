  "text":"The program was called the TWI\n   (Two Way Immersion). It was a bilingual program and that's where I learned\n   my English, that school. Friends and everything. I feel as though like,\n   that's why I learned my English so well, because I really, really wanted to\n   learn it. I always heard kids at the park or at the store, at Target, at\n   Jewels, or whatever and everybody spoke English, right? I just felt\n   fascinated, I was intrigued by it.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: It was a whole different language that I didn't know, and I wanted\n   to master it. I wanted to be able to talk as they spoke, or talk as they\n   talked. School was a very cool experience. I always had a lot of friends,\n   and I was always the life of the classroom. I wasn't probably the best\n   behaved kid, but I was always integrated in to what was going on with the\n   school.\n \n \n  "
