On the way to the school, there's a lot of danger\n   sometimes, even to cross the avenues. Some people, there's a lot of bad\n   people around here, too, sometimes, no? So that's why I'm worried. That's\n   why I'm always trying to get a good job, to have the money so we could\n   survive. At the same time, so I could be able to be with him, too, when he\n   needs. Right now, it takes me time, but the job that I have, it gives me\n   the opportunity to do a lot of things with him. So that's what I want, and\n   I want to stay with that job for a while. I mean, it's really good. I don't\n   make as much money as before, but I will be able to be at home to cook for\n   him, to do things with him. So that's something that I really wanted to do\n   because it's only him and me. If we don't take care of each other, who's\n   going to take care of us?\n \n \n  "
