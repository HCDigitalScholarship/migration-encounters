  "text":"Lizzy: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American or both?\n \n \n   Laila: Mostly, I would say both. I would say both even though I don't have\n   a paper to verify that I'm from the States. I know the language, I know the\n   history, I know a lot of more things from the States than I do for my own\n   country. I would like to consider that I am a part of the States as well.\n   [Chuckles]\n \n \n   Lizzy: How much would you say? Like fifty/fifty, or, which percent?\n \n \n   Laila: It would be, probably a seventy/thirty. Seventy percent from the\n   States and a thirty percent from Mexico [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Because that's where most of your life was.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, most of it. Probably, I didn't think that I would come back\n   and live back here in Mexico, but I guess I'm going to be staying a lot\n   longer here. It may change at a certain point, but I still do feel like I\n   am more a part of the States than I am from here.\n \n \n  "
