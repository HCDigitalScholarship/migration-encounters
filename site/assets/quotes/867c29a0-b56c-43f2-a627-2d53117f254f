  "text":"Hugo: Like I remember when we were growing up in elementary, you have your\n   black friends, you have your Asian friends, you have your white friends and\n   everything's cool. But once you start getting to middle school, or the end\n   of middle school, or high school, you start noticing things and they start\n   letting you know about stuff. And once you hit jail or juvey it's over.\n   It's racism full blast, you know? I mean people that I grew up with, they\n   were not like my enemies, but we couldn't, you know.\n \n \n  "
