  "text":"Anita: Something that we're thinking about and we want to write about is\n   what the U.S. loses by deporting people and what Mexico actually gains by\n   receiving people like you. Let me ask you that. What does the U.S. lose by\n   deporting people like Joana?\n \n \n   Joana: Well, they lose mainly trust because you don't trust anyone. You're\n   always afraid. We live in fear. You don't trust anyone. What they lose is\n   workers. We pay taxes. They lose, maybe, ties to certain things in Mexico\n   because they do have to export, import. If this keeps going on, at the end\n   of the day, they're going to stop because Donald Trump doesn't apparently\n   want us in the United States, so why does Mexico have to give them anything\n   that's Mexican? I mean, Mexico is a country where they do have a lot of\n   oil, they have coffee, what don't they have? I mean, we have a lot of\n   tourists that come to Mexico. Trump has towers here.\n \n \n  "
