  "text":"Laura: I have two, but now I'm thinking on my kids. I'm not with him\n   anymore and I am alone with my kids. So, it's pretty hard for me because I\n   didn't want them to go through the same thing that my daddy and my mom\n   went. And now for my kids, it's pretty hard to explain them that I'm not\n   going to be with their dad anymore. That it's pretty hard for me even to\n   take them to school because I have to work and sometimes my kids are\n   telling me not to go to work. They cry a lot because they miss me because\n   they don't see me too much. Call centers have a long time that you have to\n   be working. But I mean there's no other way that I can go.\n \n \n  "
