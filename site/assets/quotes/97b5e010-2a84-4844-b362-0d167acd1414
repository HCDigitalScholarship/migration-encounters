  "text":"Thank God for Cook County Hospital [Chuckles]. They don't charge you\n   a thing, but she got the medical treatment that she needed. She had brain\n   surgery. They removed the tumor and she had to be in therapy for a few\n   years in order to gain \u2026 she couldn't talk. She didn't have movement in\n   half of her face, so she couldn't speak because her tongue was numb on one\n   side, so she had to have physical therapy. I went with her a couple times\n   because I had to translate. Sometimes they didn't have people who would\n   translate for my mother. At this point, I had already learned English, but\n   she had to practice every single day. Still to this day, there are a few\n   words that she cannot say.\n \n \n  "
