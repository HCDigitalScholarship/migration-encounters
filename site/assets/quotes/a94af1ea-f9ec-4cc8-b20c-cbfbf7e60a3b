  "text":"Axel: Moving a lot and at that point, it kind of was something that I\n didn't enjoy really, because I wanted a stable home, something where I\n could build some friendships and know that I was going to have those\n friendships there for the long run. And I'd just be like, \"Oh yeah, we'll\n probably be here for a year and then my mom's going to want to move again\n and I'm going to have to start a whole new life all over.\" That's at the\n point I decided I wanted to go live with my dad. My dad had been living in\n the same area for about 10 years, so I was like, that is not going to be an\n issue at all, for him to move. He hasn't moved in 10 years, he's not going\n to move at all.\n      \n      \n"
