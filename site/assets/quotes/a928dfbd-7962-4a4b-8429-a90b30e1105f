  "text":"Isabel: Despite your own experience with the US justice system, you have\n like a larger faith that it is still like less corrupt than Mexico. Is that\n kind of what you're saying?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Well, it's very difficult because in the United States, when I\n would think about corruptions or anything like that, I think about families\n getting separated, all this stuff that's going on now with the news, with\n the President. Those are the bad things that I see up at the United States,\n about just this one guy has a problem with -- had an argument with one\n Mexican one day and it ruined his image for the rest of his life, and now a\n whole country has to has to suffer because of that. And I feel like the\n corruption here in Mexico is more inside of Mexico, more of being corrupt\n here and not having to do anything with any other countries or anything\n like that. But I do feel like there could've been more done.\n      \n      \n"
