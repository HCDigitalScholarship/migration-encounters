  "text":"Laila: It would probably have to be getting to know family members that you\n   probably never thought of meeting, or people that, I don't know, they knew\n   you when you were a baby and you don't even remember them. So it's probably\n   the having a lot more family, because in the States it was just me, my mom,\n   and my two brothers and that's it. We didn't have aunts, we didn't have\n   uncles, we didn't have cousins, we didn't have our grandmother. We didn't\n   have anybody and here it\u2019s like, you have your grandma, you have your\n   uncles, they all get together and they have parties and get togethers,\n   cookouts or whatever. It's probably being able to meet more family members.\n   That would be the only positive thing [Chuckles] that I would personally\n   see being here back in Mexico.\n \n \n  "
