  "text":"Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts\n   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical\n   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We\n   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my\n   school of course.\n \n \n  "
