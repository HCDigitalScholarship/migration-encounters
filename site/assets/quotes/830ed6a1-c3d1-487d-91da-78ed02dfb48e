  "text":"Ben: Yes. Real nice life. And my children, they didn't know that I was\n illegal until it happened. And we had\u2026Well there was a reason why we didn't\n want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just\n wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in\n junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember\n when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When\n Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school\n children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I\n got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, \"You\n know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were\n illegal aliens.\u201d And I told her, \"Probably about time we started explaining\n some things to her.\u201d She goes, \"No, with our relatives yes, but as far as\n you, no. You can't\"\n      \n      \n Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really\n don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: They didn't find out until you actually\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my\n daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very\n decorated.\n      \n      \n Anne: Beautiful.\n      \n      \n Ben: Her major is paralegal studies. She's still studying, she wants a\n law degree.\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: And she did her internship at the Marian County prosecutor\u2019s\n office. She graduated and upon graduation\u2014well before she even\n graduated\u2014she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,\n right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh wow. Wow.\n      \n      \n Ben: So, I guess it has something\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: Sure.\n      \n      \n Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going\n to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just\n got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board\n everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to\n be there for a little while.\n      \n      \n Anne: And what school does that go for?\n      \n      \n Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't\n had a lot of contact since\u2026They were busy over there, when they were over\n there, I was busy heading this way.\n      \n      \n"
