You\n   might just kill yourself, you know? So I did that, I went on research and I\n   waited for the perfect time like when the rain comes. I went looking and\n   stuff, I knew it was really dangerous, I was scared. At one point I found,\n   outside, a mushroom that I thought was it, but I was just so scared to do\n   it, you know?\n \n \n  "
