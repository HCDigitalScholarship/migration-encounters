  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n     You think that having your childhood here made a difference because you\n     went later.\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Yes.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     A lot of the people we talked to who went as children became sort of street\n     people. Because you went later you think it was different?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Right. I believe because of what we had before here in Mexico. We had a lot\n     of pressure at school. I don't know, this new expression about bullying is\n     brand new. Bullying. You didn't have this here in Mexico. There was no\n     bullying. You just got out of the school, \"Okay, why are you doing this to\n     me,\" and you fight. That's it. No words, no nothing, no bullying. It was\n     like, \"I'm not fat. I'm not skinny. I'm not short.\" No. Teachers were very,\n     very strict. Also, my cousins my age, we lived this experience with the\n     teachers who were very strict. You don't do this, you don't do that. I\n     remember them having my hands or my fingers together and they had a ruler,\n     and they hit me if I didn't have the homework, if I was misbehaving.\n     Teachers were very\u2013 you have to respect them at that time. When you go to a\n     different country, and you had this Chicano culture that there, I mean, no\n     respect. It was like, \"No, that's not what I learned.\"\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Kids who are undocumented, boys who went to the States as very, very young\n     children sometimes become part of gangs. You believe that because you went\n     to Mexican school and you had a certain set of values, you went a different\n     way.\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Exactly. Most people that I met in the States, we had these ESL classes. I\n     should say that 70% lived here, and the values that you mentioned, the\n     values were very, very settled. Not in the next 30%, the ones that maybe\n     because of here they just were immigrants, and they were poor. I mean, I'm\n     not saying that I was rich, I was poor too. But I mean they were having a\n     hard time here in Mexico. Probably they were trying to find out what they\n     were going to do with their lives."
