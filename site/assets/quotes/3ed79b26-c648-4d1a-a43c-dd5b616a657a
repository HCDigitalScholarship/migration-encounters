  "text":"I miss the taste. I miss the relaxation, everything that's around in the\n     States. It's very \u2013you don't stress that much. I used to travel around at\n     work and the view is beautiful. There's a lot of places that are beautiful.\n     I haven't had a chance to travel here. But the food, the American stuff,\n     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American\n     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a\n     coffee, it\u2019s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.\n     \"Hey Beto.\" \"Hey my friend. Same?\" It was amazing. Something that we don't\n     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat\n     you, it's beautiful.\n \n \n    "
