The day I\n need help, don't worry, I will ask you. Don't worry, you're the only person\n I can count on. So I know that whenever I need some help, I either got to\n call you or my dad.\" I was like, \"But right now, just help my daughters\n out. Since you're over there, just help them out. Either they need milk,\n diapers, whatever it is they need, just help them out.\" I was like, \"I'm\n doing my own thing over here, I'm helping my baby that I have over here and\n my stepson and I'm buying clothes to send over there, and plus I'm trying\n to make a life over here for myself also, but I also want to know that\n they're okay over there.\"\n      \n      \n"
