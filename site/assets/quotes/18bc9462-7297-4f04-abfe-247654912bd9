  "text":"Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with this but in grade school, they\n   give you this little magazine that's for Scholastic and they let you buy\n   all these books. So my mom would give me a budget in order for me to buy\n   all the books that I wanted, and when I was bad, her punishment was no more\n   books, which murdered me [Chuckles]. That would kill me. That killed me.\n   During the summer reading programs\u2014I'm not sure if you know, but in the\n   libraries, they give you prizes for reading a certain amount of books.\n \n \n   Luisa: I was always the top winner because \u2026 they knew me. I knew the\n   librarians by name. They were my friends. I was there. I couldn't find a\n   book, I would order it and within a week, they would have it. \u201cOh, your\n   book is here.\u201d I think you had a limit of twenty books and that would kill\n   me because it's like [Groans]. But it was okay, too, because I'd go back to\n   the library pretty often. It was a pretty great place. The library was\n   amazing. So yes, Scholastic. I had a huge collection of books. My mom got a\n   huge bookcase for me because I had so many books\u2014so many.\n \n \n   Luisa: My favorite genre was fantasy, of course, because at that point, it\n   was an alternate reality where magic and anything was possible. Harry\n   Potter. I grew up with Harry Potter. Grew up with Tolkien, grew up with\n   Eragon, grew up with the series for the Lady Knight, grew up with the\n   Chronicler. Grew up with all these fantasy books. I grew up with them. I\n   still read them over and over and over again because every time you read a\n   book, you find something that you missed and I love that. So yes, reading\n   was my thing [Chuckles]. I love reading.\n \n \n  "
