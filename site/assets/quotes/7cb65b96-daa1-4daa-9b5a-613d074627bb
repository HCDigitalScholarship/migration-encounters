  "text":"Hugo: But life here is different. Over there, you don't have to worry about\n   a gas tank going out on you. You pay your gas bill and you have your gas\n   all the time. You pay your water bill you can shower anytime, there's water\n   all the time. You pay your electricity bill, you have light all month. Over\n   here, if your gas tank run out or this and that, there's... It's a\n   different way of living. Over there, it's more comfortable, you live\n   better, and the money lasts a little longer. Like I've seen families, when\n   I was over there, families that would come from here and they would all get\n   to work. And in six months, they would have a car, they would have their\n   apartments, they would already be moving up.\n \n \n  "
