  "text":"Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting\n   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because\n   reading transports you to different places and different languages and\n   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been\n   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,\n   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design\n   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, \"You\n   know what? I'm going to be independent,\" so she moves aside. She starts her\n   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.\n \n \n  "
