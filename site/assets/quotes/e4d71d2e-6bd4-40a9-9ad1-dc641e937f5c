  "text":"Isabel: No, what you did like, any subjects or activities or music,\n   anything like that.\n \n \n   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and\n   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].\n \n \n   Isabel: Of what?\n \n \n   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and\n   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a\n   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh\n   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do\n   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just\n   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.\n \n \n   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now\n   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to\n   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me\n   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One\n   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German\u2014I don't\n   remember how I figured out that she was German.\n \n \n  "
