  "text":"Carolina: I was in two different schools. In elementary, it was really\n   good. It was really nice. And then you could say middle school, that was\n   whenever I moved to a different city, it was hard. I was the only Mexican\n   girl. They would usually send messages telling me to kill myself, that I\n   wasn't worth it.\n \n \n   Anne: They would send messages for you to kill yourself?\n \n \n   Carolina: Yeah. Yeah, because, well, they told me that they were better off\n   without me, well, with my race. I was the only Mexican girl, the only\n   dark-skinned, and they would be like, \"Oh, you're the fly to the milk, in\n   the glass of milk.\" It was awful.\n \n \n   Carolina: I didn't want to go to school. I was depressed. With all those\n   messages, I got really depressed. And I just tried to move forward, but it\n   was really, really hard.\n \n \n  "
