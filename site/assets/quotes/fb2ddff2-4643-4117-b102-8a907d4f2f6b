  "text":"The apartment that we moved into in California was a one-bedroom\n   apartment. It was a big complex and I remember it. There was a pool in the\n   middle and there were a lot of families like us that shared a one-bedroom\n   apartment. And there were eight to twelve people in this one space, and we\n   were trying to find something bigger, but it was impossible.\n \n \n  "
