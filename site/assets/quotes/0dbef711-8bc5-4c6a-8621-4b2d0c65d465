So, on the\n   weekends I used to go to do housekeeping service. Clean the rooms, clean\n   the bathrooms, making beds and vacuum, and everything. And then, like two\n   years later, I started working in a landscaping company.\n \n \n   Anne: Did you like that work?\n \n \n   Many: I loved it. I love to create waterfalls.
