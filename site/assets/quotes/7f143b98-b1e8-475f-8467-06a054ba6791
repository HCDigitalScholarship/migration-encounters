  "text":"Laila: Yeah. I told my parents not to get close to the school. A lot of\n   students had to walk home far distances, scared of their parents going for\n   them because they stayed out there for a while and they were stopping cars\n   coming out of the school. They stopped the teachers, they stopped everybody\n   just because of the color of their skin. You got stopped and you got asked\n   for papers or ID, even though a lot of us knew it was illegal for them to\n   stay outside of a school and ask for papers.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Absolutely.\n \n \n   Laila: They still did it and if you refused to answer, they would still\n   take you in. It was just mostly a lot of kids leaving school through back\n   doors, through the fields, the baseball fields, all of that. They were just\n   jumping the fences and leaving because we were really scared to get\n   stopped. I remember I had to tell my mom to stay away from the school\n   because this was happening. And I actually had a friend who was born in the\n   States and her parents were there legally who offered to take a couple of\n   kids home because they saw that everything that was happening and that they\n   were stopping, like relentlessly, people. Just asking for papers, and so\n   they had to carpool a couple of kids home because their parents couldn't\n   come close to the school.\n \n \n   Lizzy: That's so awful. That's terrifying.\n \n \n  "
