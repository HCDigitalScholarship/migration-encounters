  "text":"ita: No, no, no. This is super cool. So, you said you fell into a\n depression at a certain point. Tell me a little bit about that and then\n we'll move back.\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, so basically, I struggle with OCD, right? I'm sure you know\n what that is. It's a double-edged sword, it's helped me out of a lot of\n things to be more consistent. For example, if I'm doing a skateboarding\n trick, if I land like this, I have to keep doing it over\u2014\n      \n      \n Anita: Are you a skateboarder too?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, I have a lot of videos on YouTube. Dude, I was sponsored by a\n skateboarding company called VIP.\n      \n      \n Anita: Really?\n      \n      \n Billy: Bro, I think about my life sometimes it's like dude I almost forget\n that I had a skateboarding career. That's crazy to me. But yeah, if I would\n not land correctly, I would have to do it over until I landed in the middle\n of the board. And so, I would do that 10 times and then I would feel good.\n So that helped me to be more consistent but, at the same time, it does\n cause anxiety and stuff like that. It's a double-edged sword.\n      \n      \n Billy: Anyways, I was struggling with OCD, I was like, \"Man, you're just a\n freaking kid with OCD, dude. You're not going to do anything in life.\" And\n I started playing these Robert Johnson songs and my dad sees it. He's like,\n \"You know what, man? I'm going to try and motivate this guy so he can get\n more into it.\" So, he would talk to me, he offered me money. And so, I\n started getting into these songs and I started feeling more spirit. More\n enthusiasm. I'm like, \"Wow, dude, you don't just have to be this weird kid,\n you can be a jazz musician. You could be something if you want to.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: And so, I just started playing and playing it and then that dude\n just took my depression away, honestly. And now I have OCD, but I don't\n even care. I know how to cope with it, and I know how to work around it.\n So, it really gave me an identity, which was really important. I think I\n was going through an identity crisis.\n      \n      \n A"
