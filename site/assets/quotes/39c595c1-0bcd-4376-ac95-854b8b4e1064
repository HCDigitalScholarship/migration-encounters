  "text":"My mom never even told me that I never had\n   papers, until I got a little bit older in age. But it was frustrating that\n   I'm not able to unravel my full potential. I had a lot of scholarships that\n   got shot down, because of my status.\n \n \n   Donovan: They disqualified me for a lot of scholarships, because of my\n   status, so it's frustrating. Then you have my sister on the other side\n   who's only three years younger than me and she's officially a lawyer,\n   immigration lawyer, in San Francisco. She just passed the state bar exam\n   three weeks ago.\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Donovan: Yeah. And it's, I don't know, I feel like I needed to be something\n   big because of my moms, all that she went through. My dad passed away when\n   we were four in a car crash. But it was just frustrating to see everybody\n   else, \u201cWell I can get this scholarship because of this, or I can go work\n   here because of that.\u201d And I'm like, I've always been a hard worker and I\n   see them people that are just half assed. They have papers so they can be\n   half ass."
