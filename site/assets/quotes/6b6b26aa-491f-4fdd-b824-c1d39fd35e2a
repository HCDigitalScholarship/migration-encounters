You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.\"\n   So I was like, \"Hey, he's protecting me.\" I found somebody to protect me,\n   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish\n   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and\n   I couldn't go to school no more.\n \n \n  "
