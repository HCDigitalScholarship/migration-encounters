They had the\n   same problem. They didn't know how to speak English or so, and we got all\n   in some courses from school. That's mostly where I ended up learning\n   English. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: English as a second language courses? ESL courses?\n \n \n   Carlos: Yes, I think it was, yeah.\n \n \n  "
