  "text":"Luisa: International relations because I am a fucking citizen of the world.\n   Every time somebody asks me, \"Where are you from?\" I have no idea how to\n   answer because I don't feel Mexican and I don't feel American. I don't know\n   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].\n   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.\n   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,\n   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.\n \n \n   Luisa: I'm not sure if you've seen when they've asked me, \"Where are you\n   from?\" and I'm like, \"Where was I born? Where was I raised? Where's my\n   family from? Where do I live? What do you want to know?\u201d Because \u201cwhere are\n   you from?\u201d is a very loaded question to me. It's a lot about identity, and\n   I think a human being needs this [Pause] identity, this sense of belonging,\n   and I don't feel like I belong anywhere. I don't feel like I have a home.\n   Like a real one. At this point, I think my home is my partner and that\n   scares the shit out of me [Chuckles]\n \n \n   Luisa: I've thought about it. I've thought about it a lot [Chuckles]. It\n   scares me because he has become my home. He's helped me through a lot. He's\n   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my\n   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not\n   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad\n   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me\n   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking\n   about it.\n \n \n  "
