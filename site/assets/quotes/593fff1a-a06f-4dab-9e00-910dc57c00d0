I mean, I speak enough\n   English to work in an office and they tell me no because my age. So it's\n   been hard all this time, even though my friend said, \u201cWell you have already\n   nine years here.\u201d I said, \u201cFor me it's been like nine hours.\u201d I mean it's\n   been very difficult and go through everything. My kids is the worst part.\n \n \n  "
