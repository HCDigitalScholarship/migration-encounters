  "text":"Many: Yeah, I met this girl at school. She was fifteen years old, I was\n   sixteen. You know when you see somebody, and you have like a click or\n   something on the first time? It was something like that. I was in love with\n   this girl. So I started dating her and then after that, we got married. We\n   got married with her mom\u2019s permission because she can\u2019t get married. So, we\n   got married and then we went back to Mexico to get married here.\n \n \n   Anne: She was a US citizen?\n \n \n   Many: Yeah, she was born in Texas.\n \n \n   Anne: And then you had to go back to the States after the wedding?\n \n \n   Many: After the wedding, she went back first and then I just told her that\n   it was going to take me about two hours in order to go back with her\n   because I have to cross the border. I think it was around eight o\u2019clock\n   when she crossed the border in the morning. So around twelve, I was with\n   her, like twenty miles from the border in United States. I do the same\n   thing, I went to the bridge for the train and I do the same thing. I get\n   into the train. I was kind of crazy. Well, I was young and in love. I was\n   young and in love, so that's why.\n \n \n  "
