  "text":"Donovan: It was hard. It was really sketchy because I never knew Mexico. I\n   went out there and when I was two years old, so my mom tells me that my\n   first language was English. I didn't even talk that good when I would two\n   years\u2014I did talk a little bit\u2014but she said you went there and you learned\n   English so fast. She was like, that's your native language. And you could\n   hear it a little bit when I talk Spanish. You don't hear it that much, but\n   if you pay very, very close attention to how I express myself, you can tell\n   it's not the way it regular person from here expresses himself.\n \n \n  "
