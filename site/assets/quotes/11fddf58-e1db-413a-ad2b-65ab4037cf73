  "text":"They still did it and if you refused to answer, they would still\n   take you in. It was just mostly a lot of kids leaving school through back\n   doors, through the fields, the baseball fields, all of that. They were just\n   jumping the fences and leaving because we were really scared to get\n   stopped. I remember I had to tell my mom to stay away from the school\n   because this was happening. And I actually had a friend who was born in the\n   States and her parents were there legally who offered to take a couple of\n   kids home because they saw that everything that was happening and that they\n   were stopping, like relentlessly, people. Just asking for papers, and so\n   they had to carpool a couple of kids home because their parents couldn't\n   come close to the school.\n \n \n  "
