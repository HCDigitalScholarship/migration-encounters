Just come\n   back whenever you want. You don't have to wait those six months since we\n   didn't fire you, or anything like that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So, yeah. Hopefully I'll find something. They actually told me they\n   had some openings here, but if that doesn't work out, I know I could always\n   go back to Teletech. Hopefully something's got to give.\n \n \n  "
