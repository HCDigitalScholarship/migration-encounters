So, when they asked me\n   for the waiver, I will have to reschedule another appointment. When that\n   happens, she didn't really help me out anymore.\n \n \n   Anita: But when you were still in the United States, did you delay?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No. The processes, it takes too long. That's why they let me\n   go\u2014Immigration, when they got me, they let me go, because I was in the\n   process for my papers. They told me to keep going to court.\n \n \n  "
