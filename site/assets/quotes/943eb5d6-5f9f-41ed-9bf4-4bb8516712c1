  "text":"Brenda: He did well. My brother has autism, he's on the autism spectrum.\n So, when we went to California, about a half a year in he got diagnosed\n because he hadn't started talking and he wasn't really very communicative\n with us. Then we moved to Arkansas. We made sure he always got into a lot\n of programs and got a lot of help, as much as he could. He always went\n through all special Ed. throughout school and he seemed to enjoy it. He\n seemed to like it a lot. They did a lot of activities I think otherwise he\n wouldn't have done. Throughout high school he started getting more grumpy\n and like more hormonal and sometimes he wouldn't want to join in with\n stuff, but overall he enjoyed it a lot.\n      \n      \n"
