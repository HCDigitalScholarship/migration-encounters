  "text":"Zayuri: It wasn't completely new, but I did have to get used to it. It was\n   quite traumatic at the beginning, because I was like, \"Why is this place\n   like this?\u201d [Fake cries]. Even in the parts where I was living because my\n   family doesn't have that much money, so it was a very not nice part. I\n   don't know how to describe. So, it was really dangerous. And having to get\n   used to like, \"Oh, you can\u2019t go to play basketball at 10:00 PM because\n   there's cholos right there, and they might rob you or something like that.\"\n   So, I was like, \"Okay. Now what? What do we do?\" You just stay in the\n   house, but outside's too much, just way too dangerous.\n \n \n  "
