  "text":"Abel: I met her though, well, being in trouble. I mean, I knew her family\nfor years. I knew her for years, but when I got in trouble, she was writing\nme. She was writing me letters and stuff, so when I got out, I was kind of\ncourting her already. So we started going out. She wanted to help me out so\nI wouldn't get deported, so we got married. And then I had my daughter with\nher. We had our daughter. I still ended up getting deported though, because\nI missed my court date. I moved and, I never got my court date, and they\ncame and got me at work, INS."
