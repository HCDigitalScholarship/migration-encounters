  "text":"happened, of elementary school. We took off,\n   I got a tourist visa and we left. My mom actually left before me. Why? The\n   explanation I got from her was so that she can check out the situation\n   first and not put me in any sort of danger. So basically I stayed with my\n   aunt an extra year. She took off and by the time she felt stable, she\n   called for me. So, that's pretty much what happened.\n \n",
