  "text":"Laura: Yeah, when I was in high school, I was really smart, so, well, not\n   that smart, but the school told me that I can skip one year if I wanted. So\n   they skipped me one year because I was really, well, I was having a lot of\n   A's in all the classes. I was exceeding in all the classes, so they skipped\n   me from sophomore year to senior year. So I didn't go into junior year, and\n   when they skipped me, I didn't know what to do. It was too soon for me. So,\n   that's one of the reasons that I decided to use that fake number. I didn't\n   tell my mom, either, because she was going to be mad at me. She was going\n   to have to be like, \"Hey, why are you doing that? You know that it's\n   illegal.\" But come on, we were illegal already.\n \n \n   Anne: So your school didn't help you. They must have known that you were\n   undocumented there at high school.\n \n \n   Laura: They did know that we were undocumented and I have a counselor that\n   she was trying her best, but they tried to help me. They actually gave me a\n   scholarship to purchase my books. They gave me $1,000, some scholarship,\n   but it was a need required scholarship [inaudible. But for some reason it\n   was not enough. I went to live on the campus, but it was not enough with\n   that scholarship.\n \n \n   Anne: But they didn't advise you as you were applying for colleges about\n   your undocumented status and how to deal with that.\n \n \n   Laura: No, they didn't. They tried to guide me to apply to the scholarship.\n   Well, I mean this school, but they don't have that much undocumented people\n   in high school, and when they are undocumented, they don't actually like to\n   study in school. Most of them don't like to go to college or they realize\n   that there aren't able to study in college.\n \n \n  "
