  "text":"Yair: Then when we were already over here, me and my family and my sister,\n   we heard that, on the news actually, we heard that Obama gave a lot of\n   opportunity to allow immigrant people to study over here, or to study in\n   the US, to have papers and stuff. I was like, \"Man.\" I told my dad, \"See,\n   Dad? I told you to stay over there, man.\" I mean, I really liked it over\n   there. I got used to it, and I just wanted to live over there. I wanted to\n   come over here but just to visit my family, and come back.\n \n \n  "
