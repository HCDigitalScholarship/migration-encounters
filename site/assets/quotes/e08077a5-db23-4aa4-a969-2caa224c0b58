At that specific time, I remember I didn't know about the drive-by\n     shootings because I've been, well we were afraid of those at that time and\n     that's what they were trying to avoid. Since I had my childhood right here,\n     which I remember too, I didn't like Chicano that much or the gang members\n     at all. I don't have tattoos. When they, \"Oh I put on my new tattoo.\" I\n     just gave them my like sign here. \"Good for you.\" Don't like tattoos. I\n     just look at them and go, \"Good for you.\" But that's it.\n \n \n    "
