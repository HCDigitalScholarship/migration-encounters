  "text":"So, what do you miss about the US?\n \n \n   Hugo: My family and the lifestyle. If I ever went back to the States, I\n   wouldn't want to go back to Los Angeles. I wouldn't want to go there\n   because of all the movement, people that I know. It's not like I'm going to\n   go and make bad decisions. But, it's too hard. I want to be somewhere\n   where's there not a lot of people. Maybe out of the city, you know? I\n   wouldn't mind country living or anything like that because it's peaceful.\n   Like when I go to visit my grandparents, it's a small town, you can take a\n   deep breath of fresh air. Not like here. When we go over there to visit or\n   like I took my baby, so she could meet her grandad and all the aunties and\n   everything, and me and my girl didn't want to come back. We were just like,\n   you know\u2026But we have to come back and work. And over there, there's no call\n   centers or anything like that.\n \n \n  "
