  "text":"Luisa: I told my mom about this and I remember vividly having a\n   conversation with her and telling her, \"Hey, you know what? This is\n   happening at school,\" but I think my mom was going through so much stuff\n   that she didn't know how to deal with it or she didn't \u2026 there wasn't\n   enough of my mom to go around back then. I know now. I forgive her, but\n   certain things \u2026 [Pause] I forgive her a lot for it now because I get it.\n   It was extremely traumatizing. She had a lot of health issues and then this\n   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her\n   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She\n   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She\n   started going to design school for designing clothes and it\u2019s pretty great.\n \n \n  "
