  "text":"Sergio: Did the Mexican government provide help in that transition?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: The Mexican government, they provided some help. They provided 50\n   pesos when I first got here. And they just give me a whole bunch of\n   pamphlets of school and housing, right? But I feel as though independent\n   organizations were the ones who ultimately would have helped me a lot more.\n   When I first got off the plane, they told me about all the resources, all\n   the help, all the things that their company or their organization did for\n   other people, deportees."
