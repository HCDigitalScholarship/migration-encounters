  "text":"nd\n   I remember we stopped\u2014my first experience on the second time\u2014was me\n   stopping at the gas station and getting down and some dude randomly asking me\n   if I was in a gang. That was my first experience. And I should've known, I\n   should\u2019ve known this is not going to go well. Okay. So he just asked me\n   because I was wearing a red shirt, but I like red, you know, just the\n   color. So he asked me, \u201cNorte\u00f1o or something like that?\u201d And I was\n   like \u201cNo, I think I'm from the South.\u201d And he gets all pissed off and\n   everything and I don't know what the hell is going on. Then luckily he\n   realizes it. I had literally no clue of what the hell he was saying.\n \n \n  "
