  "text":"Miguel: I remember going to school, actually school wasn't that bad when we\n   lived in California, because we had the opportunity that our teachers spoke\n   English and Spanish. So they kinda knew that kids that were coming in that\n   didn't speak English. And they would try to help us out a little bit more\n   with that. And it was great. It was really great living there at the\n   beginning.\n \n \n  "
