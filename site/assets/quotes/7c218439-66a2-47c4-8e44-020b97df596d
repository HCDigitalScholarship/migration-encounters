  "text":"Well, a funny thing is that I never spoke\n   until I was six, so they thought I was autistic or something. I never ever\n   spoke. I would just watch TV. I mean, I would understand everything, but I\n   didn't speak at all. So I don't know if it's like a repercussion of the\n   whole experience, but I mean that's interesting I guess.\n \n \n   Anne: Very interesting.\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. I would just watch TV and play piano because they had a little\n   piano in the house.\n \n \n  "
