  "text":"Ilse: I think we have to work on that. We have to work on having work\n   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too\n   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe\n   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell\n   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have\n   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and\n   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak\n   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there\n   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,\n   \"Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.\" And then, them looking at me\n   weird, like, \"Why would you come back if you were over there?\" Or when they\n   ask, \"Did you have to come back because you were illegal?\" Dude, well,\n   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to\n   treat me differently.\n \n \n   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go\n   back and forth, and they don't understand; \"Well, why don't you get a visa?\n   Why did you leave without a visa?\" \u201cNo...\u201d And I think changing that\n   mindset, too, from the people that are here\u2014 the people that were born here\n   and everything\u2014there must be a way to make them understand that we're still\n   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You\n   know?\n \n \n  "
