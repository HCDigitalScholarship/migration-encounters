Meaning if you can pay\n   your bills, you don't rely too much on your dad or your mom. Like right\n   now, I live in a three-story house. Belongs to me, but I share with my mom.\n   In the U.S., I have the option to say, \u201cI\u2019m going to pay my rent. Even\n   though this is my house, I just going to move.\u201d Right here, I can\u2019t do that\n   because economics. I got another house\u2014it belongs to me\u2014but is in a\n   neighborhood that is no safe. People rob, and kill, and stab. So I stay\n   with my mom. [Laughs]. So that's the difference. And the economics give you\n   that independence. You know, well, I can rent another place. Is not a big\n   deal.\n \n \n  "
