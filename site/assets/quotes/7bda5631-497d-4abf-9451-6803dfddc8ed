  "text":"Billy: I was 21 when I started playing music. Prior to that I didn't know\n how to play one note on the guitar.\n      \n      \n Anita: Seriously?\n      \n      \n Billy: Seriously, dude. And I would love to show you, not right now but\n when you have time, a video of me playing and it's just... I'm not trying\n to sound cocky but I'm very proud of that progress. Yeah. And you know it's\n funny because my dad will be like, \"Dude, if you learn one whole song, if\n you learn one whole Blues song, I'll give you $100.\" So, me being young and\n money hungry I would stay up all night learning these songs and then in the\n morning he would give me the money. So that also was a motivation like,\n \"Dude, I'm just going to get this money.\" I would learn the songs and\n stayed up all night like, \"Dad, I can play now.\" And he's like, \"Man, all\n right. Here's the money.\" So, that was pretty cool.\n      \n      \n Anita: So, your dad was a musician. As a musician he must've been pretty\n proud of you wanting to do that?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, he was really happy that I got into it but, for me, I would go\n a little harder, he would offer me money, which was not necessary, but in a\n way it was like, \"Dude, I want to just show my dad that I can play music\n well. I can be like him in a way.\" So, yes, he motivated me a little bit.\n And then he said I was better than him. After a year of playing he was\n like, \"Dude, you're better than me now.\"\n      \n      \n Anita: Did you ever play with him?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yes, I would play sometimes. A rhythm like \u201c[Singing 00:06:32] Doo\n doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo\u201d and he would just do the\n \u201c[Singing] dein neih neihn.\u201dWe would play sometimes but yeah, when he saw\n that I got into it he supported that, for sure.\n      \n      \n"
