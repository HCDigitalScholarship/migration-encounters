  "text":"of photography I know. So I\n   learned on YouTube. I started working with this friend and that's what I\n   did. I would do painting jobs, like painting houses during the week from\n   seven to four or five, after that I would get to home. I would do some\n   photoshop, editing, and on the weekends I'll go just take photographs. I\n   most did Quincea\u00f1eras and weddings photography.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anne: Yea",
