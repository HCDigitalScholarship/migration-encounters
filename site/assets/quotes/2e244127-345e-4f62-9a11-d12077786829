  "text":"Anita: He said, \u201cDon't tell anyone that you're not a U.S. citizen?\u201d\n \n \n   Luis: Mostly, my pa was telling me, \"Hey, I know that you are proud of\n   being American and Mexican at the same time, but don't go telling all the\n   people that you know because most people don't get it. Most people just\n   don't like hearing that you are not a citizen. Most people don't like\n   hearing that you're from Mexico because whenever they hear that there's a\n   Latino in their neighborhood, God, they go crazy. They might go batshit\n   crazy. They're going to start rocks at you.\u201d That's an exaggeration of\n   course. But I've heard some horrible things that they did to people in my\n   neighborhood. Like, I don't know, going inside their houses, trashing down\n   their places, just that kind of stuff. There was always a fear in the back\n   of my head which was like, \u201cWhat if you tell the wrong person? What if you\n   say something that you shouldn't have said? What if you mess up?\u201d Living\n   with fear is horrible. But most of the time I was okay. Most of the time it\n   was cool.\n \n \n  "
