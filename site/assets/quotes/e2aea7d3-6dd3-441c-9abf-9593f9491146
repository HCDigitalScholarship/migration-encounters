I had.\n \n \n   Anita: You were carrying it with you?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. I didn't have any American I.D.s. I mean, we can't get them, so\n   that was the only I.D. I had\u2014my passport. That's how they got my\n   nationality and everything.\n \n \n   Anita: Were there a lot of other women in detention?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, but not a lot. There were mainly men, mainly. Actually, I had\n   already gotten stopped, but I was a minor and they hadn't taken any\n   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,\n   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment\n   complexes where we used to live. All of a sudden, we just got stopped by\n   two I.C.E. officers. They never identified themselves. They didn't say why\n   we got stopped. They pretty much didn't give out any information at all.\n   They just went in and I.D.-ed them.\n \n \n  "
