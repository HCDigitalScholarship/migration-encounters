  "text":"Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like\n   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt\n   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.\n   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,\n   [you don\u2019t crave it] You're like, \"Okay, it's fine.\"\n \n \n   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about\n   the United States?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other\n   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and\n   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like\u2014well at\n   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw\n   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in\n   five minutes, the cops are there.\n \n \n  "
