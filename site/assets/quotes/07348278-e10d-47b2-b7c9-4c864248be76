  "text":"Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,\n there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I\n presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I\n was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years\n or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25\n years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all\n until my lawyer said, \"This is where we're at. You want to protect your\n wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,\n you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.\u201d She literally took out\n her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,\n and then\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Where are the kids?\n      \n      \n Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, \"Let's go to\n trial, I'm going to fight this.\" The next day the state called me, and they\n said, \u201cWe're going to offer you three years.\u201d And I told my lawyer, \"Okay.\n So what's going to happen?\" She said, \"You've already done nine months.\n You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.\" And I\n said, \"Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,\n I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever\n she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.\" So I said, \"Okay,\n I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an\n immigration bond, so I should be good to go.\" As soon as I got to prison,\n immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road\n ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.\n But I ended up being deported.\n      \n      \n"
