  "text":"Dan: Well, basically, you really have to think more than twice about what\n   you want and what you're willing to give up. In some scenarios, you don't\n   think with your head. You think with your heart. Your heart, it's not wise\n   as your head. Always think about the worst-case scenario. You always think\n   about your worst-case scenario, if you're ready for it. And sometimes\n   crossing a desert or crossing the river, you end up there. You have to\n   think about it. You have to realize what it could be the worst. But always\n   be alert for what is coming, but at the same time, know your own limits\n   because you can say, \"Yeah, yeah. I can do this. I can do this,\" but at the\n   last minute, you might have not the motivation or you might not have the\n   guts to do it. And you put your own limit to yourself. Whatever they do,\n   just think twice.\n \n \n  "
