My parents were like, can\n   you please cross my baby boy, we're going to cross over here. You could do\n   it legally and it's going to be easier. And yeah, it was actually easier\n   and I was lucky then, because I was given back.\n \n \n   Anne: Yes.\n \n \n   Luis: And yeah, that's how we got there.\n \n \n   Anne: And you had siblings with you too?\n \n \n   Luis: Yes, I had a little brother. So I was definitely one, because my\n   little brother is one year younger than me. So yeah, I was with my big brother\n   who's four years older and my little brother who's one year younger than me.\n \n \n   Anne: [Affirmative noise]\n \n \n   Luis: So yeah, everybody crossed. Yeah, so she crossed me and my little\n   brother who were actually given to this lady."
