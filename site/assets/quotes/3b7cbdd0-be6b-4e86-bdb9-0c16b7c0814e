  "text":"Anne: When you were in the US, what were your dreams?\n \n \n   Laura: I really wanted to be a doctor, but in Mexico\u2026 Oh my god, I really\n   tried to be a doctor here, but it was complicated because most of the what\n   is required in here to be a doctor is complicated. You need a lot of money\n   to be a doctor. So, well, money again. [Chuckles]\n \n \n   Anne: So, your dreams have changed?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah. Right now, yeah I have a lot of different goals. More\n   tangible, more realistic goals, yeah.\n \n \n  "
