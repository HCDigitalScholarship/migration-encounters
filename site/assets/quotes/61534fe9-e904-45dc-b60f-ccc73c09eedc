  "text":"Ruben: And three years later we moved to Whittier, which was an area where\n   there were no poor people. It was medium class and high class and there\n   were rich people and medium class people. And we lived there for a while.\n   But at that time I had already learned a few words in English. I could\n   speak to somebody, but in the beginning it was frustrating because I\n   couldn't say, \"Hey, can I borrow your pencil?\" I will do it with signs,\n   like if I had a pencil in my hand. And in between that we lived in\n   Englewood for about nine months and it was actually not that bad because\n   the African American people there, they didn't discriminate against us,\n   they would try to teach you. How to speak, you know. Ask them stuff or\n   like, they would come and tell me if I wanted to play, and I would be like,\n   \"huh?\" And they would be like, \"You know on your bike? You know your\n   helmet? Let\u2019s go.\"\n \n \n  "
