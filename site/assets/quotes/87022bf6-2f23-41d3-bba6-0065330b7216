  "text":"Anita: Would you consider going back to the US?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Why?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Because I grew up over there, and to be honest with you, I miss a\n   lot over there. I know I could do more things over there than over here,\n   but you know one of the things that I don't want to go illegally, not\n   anymore. I mean, I want to go legally, and I know it may take some time.\n   But I could do it because my son and my daughter, they're from over there.\n   They will be able to get my papers fixed. When that happens, I want to be\n   able to go legally, and I want to go to work, do some things. Like how it\n   was my American dream back when I was over there. Right here, I won't say\n   that. At the beginning, when I got here, I didn't know nobody. It was\n   really hard. I got in depression and a lot of things, but now, I mean, I'm\n   living day by day, and I have to like it. I'm okay now. But, yes, I will go\n   back one day. But I want to go legally, not illegal.\n \n \n  "
