  "text":"Noe: About my coworkers. They really help you out. They know how to talk to\n   you. We connect really well. That's why I feel okay. I feel like in high\n   school over there. We get along each other, we joke each other. There\u2019s no\u2026\n   a lot of people speak English better than me, like, \u201cGo eff yourself.\u201d\n \n \n   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs\n   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't\n   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the\n   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they\n   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with\n   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white\n   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're\n   white\u2014that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are\n   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to\n   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or\n   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that\n   for them, they was just complaining about me.\n \n \n  "
