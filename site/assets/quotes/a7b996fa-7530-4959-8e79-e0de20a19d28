  "text":"We're together. We're actually together. We become very good friends\n     because this is what happens when they learn English, they get to learn the\n     culture. They get to learn the American culture by all these games, by\n     watching the movies. We can have a conversation. If someone here does not\n     have the same ideas, we don't actually have this problem. Some of them ask\n     us, \"Hey, you've been in the States, how is this? How is that? You've been\n     to Disneyland?\" \"Yes.\" \"Mickey mouse is big?\" But that's simple stuff. They\n     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't\n     know, \"Hey, what is a money order?\" \"That's like a voucher. We don't have\n     these here.\" \u201cOh, that's a money order.\u201d\n \n \n    "
