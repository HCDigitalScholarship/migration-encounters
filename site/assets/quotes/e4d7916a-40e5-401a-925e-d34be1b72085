  "text":"I've never felt challenged by any of my\n   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my\n   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm\n   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't\n   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated\n   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in\n   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, \"Ugh. What\n   am I supposed to do with you?\"\n \n \n  "
