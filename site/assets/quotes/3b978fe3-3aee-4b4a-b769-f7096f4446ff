I have my\n   documents.\" They actually told me, \"Well, you're right about some things,\n   but wrong about different things. Yes, you have been here your whole life,\n   but you didn't cross legally into the States. That's why\u201d I said, \"Oh,\n   okay. So, we are illegal.\" That's when I confirmed it, I guess.
