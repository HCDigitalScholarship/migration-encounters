One time I remember my friend went into a gas station and\n   stole some cigarettes, which is\u2014how do you grab the cigarettes in the back\n   counter? And I was with that guy. Fights. I also loved fighting. It's just\n   a way of me just getting my anger out.\n \n \n   Mike: I got a lot of disorderly conducts and it was for fighting. It's just\n   something about fighting that just releases the stress. It just releases my\n   anger. And since I didn't want to take it on my family, I would just\n   always, whoever wanted it, I'd be the first one to step in. And it's crazy\n   because I was the shortest one I remember. I was the shortest one man.\n \n \n  "
