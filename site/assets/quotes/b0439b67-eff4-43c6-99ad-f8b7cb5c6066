  "text":"Isabel: Before we get to that, just to go back a little bit, can you tell\n   me about your deportation and return to Mexico a bit? I guess return in\n   parentheses, since you kind of grew up...\n \n \n   Weco: It was all right. It kind of was hard to get used to it, walking\n   around, looking. I'm used to having my car out there, having my own things.\n   So, having to go from a car to a train, which is a metro here, going out\n   there, it was difficult. Food wise, I'm used to just eating anything over\n   there and going to some quick restaurant, whatever it is, fast food.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah. What do you miss the most?\n \n \n   Weco: Where I stayed at, we had Steak 'n Shake Rally's. I miss that so\n   much. Out here we don't have that. The only thing I've actually had out\n   here was IHOP, which is good. I like IHOP. But other than that, McDonald's\n   don\u2019t taste the same, I think. It's kind of different.\n \n \n   Isabel: No, I think that's pretty common. Do you think that your adjustment\n   was more difficult because you didn't really grow up here at all?\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: Did it feel like you were entering just a completely new country?\n \n \n   Weco: That's what it felt like, like they just dropped me off in the\n   jungle.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: Just said, \"Here. Just go from here. You're on your own.\" And mainly\n   it's just I had no family out here. They just dropped me off and said,\n   \"You're on your own.\"\n \n \n  "
