  "text":"Brenda: Probably. Sometimes I have very optimistic ideas about certain\n things. I think that\u2014not as a judgment towards anyone\u2014I'm a good kid over\n there. Sometimes a lot of it was because of fear of if you get in trouble.\n You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like \u2026 I was always\n told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many\n of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get\n into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.\n But I was always like, \u201cNo, because if something happens to me or the\n police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would\n involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.\u201d Here I think I would still do\n the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, \u201cYou\n can't go out.\u201d I'd be like, \u201cOkay.\u201d I'm still very obedient. All right, I\n don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with\n anyone.\n      \n      \n"
