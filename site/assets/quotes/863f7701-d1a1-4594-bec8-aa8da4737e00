  "text":"Yeah. For example, as we know, most of the famous engineers, they\n   were Mexicans. For example, we can talk about the color TV everyone uses on\n   the whole world, but it became from a Mexican. So, I want to mark the\n   history of Mexico and have a special project an invent that could help the\n   whole world. I would like to leave my mark on the history of Mexico and not\n   saying it was a Mexican, I'm sorry for the [inaudible] but it was a Mexican\n   who got development in Canada or the USA and here's the achievement. So\n   that's what I would really like. Also for example, I don't know if you have\n   used the Metro cards?\n \n \n   Lizzie: Yep.\n \n \n   Frank: It's an invent from the Politecnico and it's something that it's\n   really improving a lot of places here and public transport to make it a lot\n   easier and green ecology for the world. I really want to leave my mark. We\n   have programs, for example, at this moment we're working on a specific top\n   quad for the roofing like\u2026Imperma -- I don't know how to say it.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Like a layer to go on the roof...\n \n \n   Frank: A layer to go on the roof that it's a hundred percent ecologic and\n   we're working in developing on it\u2026It's something that at this moment, as a\n   group on my University, we're working on it, but we hope that we can leave\n   a mark on the green environment that we're trying to make on Mexico. We can\n   say it's a mentality that our University makes on us. I want to continue\n   with that because it's okay if I say on Spanish?\n \n \n  "
