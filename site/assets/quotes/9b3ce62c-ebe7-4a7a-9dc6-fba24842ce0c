  "text":"I had a cop one time, I didn't have\n anything on me, no reason for them to even search me to begin with,\n everything was okay. But the problem was I had two phones. I had just\n bought a new phone, and I had my old phone that I was going to sell or give\n away to my ex-wife, so that she could have it and sell her phone. They\n caught me with... They pulled me over, searched me. They're like, \"Why do\n you have two phones?\" Like thought I stole one. I'm like, \"No, I didn't.\n All my information's in both of the phones, I'll show you.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: The guy didn't like my whole attitude that I had with them, so he\n decided he took his phone out, he showed me a bag of... What was it? I\n think it was weed or I don't know what else it had in it, because it was a\n big bag, like a trash bag. Just full of stuff. And he's like, \"Look, I've\n got this in my car right now in my trunk. If you don't hand over one of\n your phones,\" He's like, \"And actually, the one I want is that one.\" He\n wanted the brand new one. \"And actually, I want this one. So look, this is\n the deal. Either you give us the phone and everybody goes about their ways,\n or I take you in and I'm going to put this on you. There's no way that\n anybody can prove that it's not true. My partner's obviously going to go\n with me.\" He's like, \"So you decided what you want to do. Do you want to go\n ahead and let us take you in and we'll put this big bag of stuff that I got\n with you, on you? Or you give me the phone?\"\n      \n      \n"
