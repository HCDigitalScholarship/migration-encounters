  "text":"Jose: My mom did cleaning most of her life. She still does cleaning.\n   Housecleaning. She actually maintains a single property now. She's like a\n   house sitter, I guess. She makes enough money there to support herself, but\n   at the time, I was making enough money to pay for rent and she was just\n   helping out with bills. The money she was making, she was able to pay her\n   car note and paid my little sister's school stuff or whatever. So I was\n   mainly in charge of paying rent and bills and stuff like that. And now\n   she\u2019s having a tough time because I'm over here, but there's no way I'm\n   going back with the way the laws are, theimmigration laws are right now. I\n   actually want to wait it out after a new presidency. See what happens.\n \n \n  "
