  "text":"Adrian: Can you tell me about your first job that you had in the United\n   States?\n \n \n   Juan: Well, when you get there you don't have that many choices. And\n   basically, there are a lot of jobs that nobody wants to do. And when you\n   get there, you get there usually with no money, usually in need of\n   everything. So you take the first job that comes your way. And it was at a\n   restaurant, an Italian restaurant. And I was a busboy, I was cleaning\n   tables and helping in the kitchen, helping the waiters. It was basically at\n   a restaurant.\n \n \n   Adrian: Oh, good. That's the only job that you have in the United States or\n   did you do more jobs? Do you do other kinds of work?\n \n \n   Juan: No. At first I had jobs like that restaurant-wise, but then since I\n   know how to drive commercial vehicles, I was able to get a job driving a\n   vehicle and I drove a bobtail truck, delivering gasoline and diesel. And I\n   did that for a long time. And I took many driving jobs because of the\n   commercial license that I used to have. I used to have several jobs driving\n   commercial vehicles. But then when I got married, my wife didn't want me to\n   do anymore that job because it was kind of dangerous. So I stopped doing\n   it. And I was facing the possibility of getting another job, basically\n   driving or doing something else. I picked something else and I started my\n   own business.\n \n \n  "
