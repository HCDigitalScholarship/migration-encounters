  "text":"Juan: What I really want to say is that I really hope that this interview\n   can reach some ears from the right people, to listen and to really start\n   doing their jobs, meaning for them to start working for people. And for\n   them to stop all the corruption and bureaucracy that we live in Mexico. All\n   that is, it's killing this country. The corruption and the bureaucracy,\n   politicians, bad politicians, they are killing this country. And it's\n   terrible and it hurts because it's just a matter of, if they were doing\n   their jobs, I can almost guarantee you that almost no Mexican people would\n   want to go to the United States and work and find a better life. And they\n   do, I did, because I had no opportunities, I had no opportunities here. If\n   they were doing their jobs and they were doing what they were supposed to,\n   many people didn't have to go, they didn't have to leave their countries\n   and their families behind. Just because they're seeking a better life.\n \n \n  "
