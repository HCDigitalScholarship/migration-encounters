  "text":"Donovan: I feel like I'm never vulnerable, because I don't put my situation\n   in a vulnerable spot. I'm never scared, because I know how to handle every\n   situation. But it was a little bit weird to figure out if I would ever be\n   caught by ICE. I never thought I would, because I thought... It was like\n   when you're younger you think you're the man of steel and nothing's going\n   to happen to you. You feel like you can ricochet bullets off your chest.\n   But it's frustrating. Limited. And then it was real eye opener when they\n   told me that I had an INS hold.\n \n \n  "
