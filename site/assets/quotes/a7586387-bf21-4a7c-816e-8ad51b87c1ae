  "text":"Yordani: And the other... We moved away from town, where I would hang out\n   with all my friends and yeah, so I just isolated myself with some games. I\n   spent like five, like three, seven, four, five, six, seven years just doing\n   that. I got really bad, I guess my social skills got really bad, just lost\n   all my friends. Got new friends online that weren't really friends. I\n   didn't even know who they were. And yeah, I was just in a really bad state\n   of mind, you know? I hated going outside, it was so... I guess I didn't\n   know where to get help. I guess I had a computer, so I'd be on the computer\n   and I'd just research a bunch of stuff.\n \n \n  "
