  "text":"Ana: My current dreams in Mexico is, or are to actually travel. One of the\n huge benefits of being in your own country and working, or simply just\n actually being legal is traveling. And I hadn't realized that I really\n enjoyed it until I had it. So one of my biggest dreams is to continue\n traveling. I want to continue knowing Mexico and there are really, really\n beautiful places. I want to get to know other cultures and other countries,\n and that's one of the freedoms than being a legal alien or a citizen allows\n you to do. And I want to continue to grow professionally. I'm fortunate\n enough to work in a global company. So my big, big goal is actually to\n continue growing within the company and to be sent to a different part of\n the globe to work.\n      \n      \n"
