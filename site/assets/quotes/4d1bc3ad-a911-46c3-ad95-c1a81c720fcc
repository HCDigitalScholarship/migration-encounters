But now it got a\n   little bit harder, because now he's getting a little bit older, and he's\n   getting older, and the problems start.\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah. You don't have a partner?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No. No, I'm single. [Laughs]. No, I mean, I used to have a\n   girlfriend. But nothing else.\n \n \n  "
