  "text":"The area where I lived there was all kinds of gangs. I did\n   get affiliated. I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,\n   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they\n   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just\n   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not\n   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just\n   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back\n   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really\n   think I was, \"Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.\" I\n   just thought, \"Oh, yeah, it's cool.\" I did want to be part of something,\n   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that\n   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.\n \n \n  "
