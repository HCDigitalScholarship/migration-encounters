  "text":"Abel: And then I never got the letter, so they thought I skipped bail. So\nthe bounty hunters came and got me, took me to the INS building in\ndowntown. Once I was there, my lawyer, he told me to go ahead and just sign\ndeportation, that he could get me my papers easier through the outs. So I\nlistened to him, which was stupid, and I signed my voluntary deportation.\nAnd this was in '97, something like that. So I get out. I mean, they deport\nme. That same day \u2013I\u2019m back in Mexico-I call my wife, \"Come and get me.\nBring my license. Bring one of your friends, or one of her boyfriends, or\nhusband, whoever you want to bring.\" I just crossed. I crossed right\nacross. My license, U.S. citizen. Plus, my name helps, because my name's\nAbel Martine, but over there you only use your first last name.\n      \n      "
