  "text":"They stopped me, I had some\n   marijuana, they gave me a ticket. A ticket that I could go do community\n   service or that I could go pay $100, $200 fine whatever\u2014it's not illegal in\n   the States, in California. And one day before going to work, I was in the\n   stroller with my kid, and my ex-baby mama, my ex-lady. We crossed the light\n   walking, a red light, right? But this street is empty. And there happened\n   to be a cop passing by. So, he pulls us over when we're pushing my baby in\n   the stroller, when there's dead traffic, no traffic at all. He was\n   Hispanic, he was Latino, his last name was Ramirez. And I'm like, I did get\n   a little, you know, \"What? What are you stopping me for?\" \"Because you seen\n   that I seen you crossing and you smiled at me. You laughed at me.\" \u201cAh, so\n   you're stopping me because of your feelings?\u201d You can't tell a cop that\n   because oh my God, that's it, it's over.\n \n \n   Hugo: So, he's like, \"Look I'm going to run your name and if you have\n   anything, I'm going to take you, this and that.\" I'm like, \"Man why didn't\n   you go to get somebody that's actually doing something? You see me with my\n   baby and my baby mama, what do you think I'm doing? You think I'm up to no\n   good or what? I'm about to go to work in a few hours. Why you messing with\n   me? Go get somebody that's actually doing something.\" So, I shouldn't have\n   run my mouth, but he could have not taken me. And he ran my name and he's\n   like, \"Oh, you have a warrant for your arrest\"\u2014$5,000 or something. Which\n   is nothing. If the warrants are from $40,000 and under, they can decide to\n   let you go, to pay a fine, to do community service. They can decide to not\n   take you in. Because it's not even something big. It could have been fixed\n   with me paying or community service.\n \n \n   Hugo: So, I didn't get more mad, I realized there was a warrant, and then I\n   went off on him. He was going to take me, so I softened up, and I was like,\n   \"You know what? I'm about to go to work, I'm the man of the house, my wife\n   doesn't work, I have to pay the bills. I got to go. Don't take me in. You\n   know I can fix that in court.\" \"No, no, no. For being a loudmouth, I'm\n   going to take you in.\" And I'm like, \"You know I've got an ICE hold because\n   it shows there. If you take me in for that, they're going to deport me.\"\n   And I was like, \"Who's going to take care of my family?\" He was like, \"Well\n   you should have thought of that when you ran your mouth.\" And I was like,\n   \"Well you have the decision of letting me go and I can fix this with a\n   payment or anything, but you're going to mess up my family. I'm going to\n   get deported.\"\n \n \n   Hugo: And I told him, \"Man, you're Mexican, you're Hispanic, you might be\n   the first, second, third, generation, but I bet your people before that\n   weren't. Think about that shit man.\" He still took me. I went in. And like\n   36 hours later, no 24, almost a day and a half, only the time that it takes\n   to process in and process out, that's how I paid my sentence. 15 days,\n   which is, you do 10% of 15 days, how much time is it? Nothing. In and out.\n   But on the way out, you're getting dressed and everything and ICE is\n   already there \"You've been in jail a few times and you've never seen ICE?\"\n   And I was like, \"Well no.\"\n \n \n   Hugo: Yeah, they're like, \"Where were you born?\" This and that. And that's\n   it, they took me. And that's where I went to the immigration library and I\n   started looking at the different things that you can apply for.\n \n \n  "
