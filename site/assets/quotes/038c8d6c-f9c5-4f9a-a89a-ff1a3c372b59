  "text":"Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the\n   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and\n   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of\n   that, it actually starts making us say, \"Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,\n   just seeing what you do.\" So, you start growing some type of anger towards\n   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and\n   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,\n   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both\n   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, \"Man,\n   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or\n   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards\n   them, \"Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.\" I\n   always said, \"It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,\n   they didn't love me.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with\n   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those\n   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told\n   her, \"Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger\n   on the streets.\" So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,\n   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an\n   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you\n   are already ready for that.\n \n \n  "
