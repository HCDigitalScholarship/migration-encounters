  "text":"Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when\n   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, \"Hey, mom. I need to tell you\n   something, but you're going to get really mad.\" I was like, \"Okay. Tell\n   me.\" I thought he did something bad. He's like, \"I'm in love.\" [Laughing].\n   So, I was just like, \"Hold on. I was expecting something else.\" So he's\n   like, \"I'm in love.\" I'm like, \"Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get\n   mad at it.\" \"Wait, mom. It gets worse.\u201d I'm like, \"Okay.\" \"She's in third\n   grade.\" [Chuckles]. So, I was like, \"Okay. She's old for him,\" but inside\n   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, \"Okay. I'm not going to tell\n   him \u2018No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's\n   too big.\u2019 No.\" I was like, \"Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.\n   What's the problem?\" He's like, \"Are you sure?\" I'm like, \"Yeah. You like\n   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.\"\n   So, he looked at me and he's like, \"Can I write a letter for her?\" I was\n   like, \"Go ahead.\" So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since\n   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,\n   respect her. That's it.\n \n \n  "
