  "text":"Anita: Let\u2019s begin by you telling me a little bit about migrating to the\n   United States.\n \n \n   Luisa: Migrating to the United States: okay. My parents had an extremely\n   bad divorce - very, very, very bad divorce. My dad's family is on the\n   wealthier side and a little bit on the powerful side, and my mom has no\n   money nor connections, and she's poor. When they were divorcing, by the end\n   of their marriage\u2014I think it was the most awful marriage that I've seen\u2014he\n   was threatening her with taking us away and completely \u2026 you know she would\n   never see us ever, so like a thief in the night, she grabbed my two sisters\n   and I and she moved us to the States.\n \n \n  "
