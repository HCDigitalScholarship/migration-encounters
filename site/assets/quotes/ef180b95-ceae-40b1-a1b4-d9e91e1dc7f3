  "text":"Anita: Did Gerald Ford know you were undocumented?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: No, Gerald Ford didn't know I was undocumented, no. I was still\n   very young at that point. My mother and my family always told me, \"Don't\n   let anybody know you're undocumented.\u201d If somebody finds out, for whatever\n   reason, there's some people who just are plain out racist or don't want\n   people like me in the States. Sometimes they just do things to... I don't\n   know. That's what I understood and that's what I took in and that's what I\n   applied to my life. It's like living a secret, it was like living a second\n   life or whatever. It\u2019s like, \"Oh shit, why do I have to lie, why?\" I guess\n   it's neither here nor there now, right? I'm here in Mexico.\n \n \n   Anita: That must have been incredibly difficult. I know personally, because\n   I've had to keep secrets.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, I guess it's one of those things where you think it's never\n   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the\n   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of\n   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't\n   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can\n   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,\n   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school\u2014I'm in high school\u2014I'm doing\n   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped\n   out. Did everything, they\u2019ve already gone to prison and back and\n   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A\n   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same\n   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I\n   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my\n   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license\n   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the\n   answer was, but I asked my mom, \u201cHey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I\n   can get my license? \u201cShe was like, \"You know you can't get your license.\"\n   Again, one of the primary things, I\u2019m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able\n   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over\u2014as a matter of\n   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers\n   license.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I never got why the paper said, \"Driving on a suspended license.\"\n   I would always ask them, \"If I don't have a license, why is it suspended?\"\n   They just told me, \"Because you have a drivers license number, but you\n   don't have a drivers license? I'm like, \"Okay, so if I have a drivers\n   license number, why can't I get my drivers license?\" \"You don't have the\n   proper documentation.\" I'm like, \"But I have my...\"\n \n \n   Rodolfo: One day I thought, \u201cWell why don't I just grab the driver license\n   number and have somebody make me a fake drivers license, and put the\n   drivers license on there?\u201d But see, if I get caught with it, now I'm in\n   more trouble, and now I'm seen as a real criminal, because now I'm going\n   around the system once again. That's why we don't want you here, because\n   you're gonna do things like that. [Exhale] I haven't talked about this in a\n   while. It just makes me want to\u2026I don\u2019t know.\n \n \n  "
