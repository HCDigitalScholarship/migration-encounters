  "text":"Rodolfo: No, Chicago's a sanctuary city, yeah. That's why I don't\n   understand why I was picked up. The day I got picked up, I was driving to\n   work. I parked my car and out of nowhere a Ford truck, it was unmarked\n   truck, they didn't even have the DHS seal on it. I didn't understand it,\n   because I even told them all, \"Isn't this a sanctuary city? Can you guys do\n   this, is this against my Constitutional rights? I'm not that sure, not that\n   well-educated in that aspect of it, but here, give me a book, I'll read it\n   and I'll tell you what it is. I'm not stupid bro.\" That's why they\n   separated me from the other people I was with, because it wasn't only\n   Mexicans that I was with. I was with somebody from... I was with two\n   Somalians.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: They were brothers actually, two Somalians. I told everybody,\n   \"Man, don't sign anything, don't talk, don't say anything. Just tell them\n   you want a lawyer and that's it.\u201d I remember they told me, \"Shut up,\" and\n   they put me in a different cell, because I kept on telling everybody not to\n   sign anything. Yeah, that's what I didn't understand\u2014I didn't understand\n   how they were able to go get me, but as I understood then and now,\n   obviously federal laws are always gonna trump state laws."
