  "text":"Noe: Detention, it's just disgusting. It's just disgusting. There's hair\n   everywhere. Everything is dirty. It smells. The beds are hard. They give\n   you like, a little mattress like this, and it's just plastic. No, it's\n   undescribable. If you've never been there, it's undescribable. You can't\n   sleep because you always have to be aware. You never know who's going to\n   come through that door or who's going to be sleeping with you on the next\n   bunker. Yeah, it's rough. And you get sick there. I was just sick of it. I\n   was like, give me my deportation. I just want to go.\n \n \n  "
