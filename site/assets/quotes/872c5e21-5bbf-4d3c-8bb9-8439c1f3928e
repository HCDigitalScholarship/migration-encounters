  "text":"Dan: Once you cross the border without any proper documentation, you're up\n   for anything. You have to be aware. They're not going to give you anything\n   free. You don't belong there. Bottom line, you don't belong there. If you\n   work for having a visa, then we're talking about, hey, you have rights\n   because you went through the whole process. I don't think I'm not logical\n   person, I think that I can think logically. And I don't agree with those\n   American people that they live at the border and they take the job as a\n   security officer and holding people. And they're doing somebody else's job\n   because they don't want them to come. Let whoever is in charge of doing\n   their job and mind your own business. No? Now, people that are taking the\n   risks, they're going to have to pay their consequences sooner or later. But\n   it is up to them if they want to pay them or how they want to live, how\n   much they want to risk. Some kids, they cross the border, they don't make\n   it. And their parents, their siblings, they're crying over on their\n   hometowns because they didn't made it. But nobody forced them to do that.\n   There's always risks for everything that you do.\n \n \n  "
