  "text":"Anne: No, they haven't reached an agreement, but it's this new dream. If\n   you had known that all you had to do was keep going to school and you could\n   get a social security card and you could have a path to citizenship, would\n   that have made a difference, do you think?\n \n \n   Mike: Yes. I feel like yes, if I would have known earlier. But at the same\n   time, once you start living in Arizona, or anywhere in the US, you kind of\n   start thinking like you're from there. I was telling the nice lady from\n   earlier, Anita, that once you get used to it, once you think that you're\n   from there\u2014that was my mistake, because I started not caring\u2014you just start\n   doing stuff that if you don't have papers you should know you're not\n   supposed to do. I got kind of carried away and was trying to get the whole\n   world. Because I didn't have my papers, I was trying to go after everybody.\n   I'm like, \"Okay. So if I can't work, cool, I'll just do my own thing, or\n   I'll just do this, do that.\"\n \n \n  "
