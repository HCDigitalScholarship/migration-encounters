I miss everything. After I got into\n   football, I made a lot of friends. Most of the time when I was free after\n   school I spent my time with them playing basketball, always doing\n   something, because over there in Arkansas, in Clinton, Arkansas, there's\n   not much to do. It's a really small town.\n \n \n  "
