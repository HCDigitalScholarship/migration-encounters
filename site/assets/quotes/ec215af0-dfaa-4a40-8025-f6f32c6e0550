  "text":"Melani: It was horrible because my grandfather had three restaurants and\n   real estate in Arkansas and he was the one that exploited my dad. In\n   Arkansas at that time it was seven dollars an hour and he would give my dad\n   three dollars an hour [Pause] in his restaurant, and my dad figured out\n   that he would only employ illegals, and especially Native Americans that\n   didn't speak Spanish\u2014that they spoke dialects so they wouldn't understand\n   what was going on\u2014and since they didn't know anything because it was a new\n   country to them, he could exploit them and never report taxes.\n \n \n   Anita: Your grandfather who was originally from Mexico\u2026\n \n \n   Melani: Yes, and he came before 1983, which was the amnesty. Yeah, and he\n   got his citizenship from that. His whole family got it, and then he went to\n   look for my dad when he was eighteen or nineteen and he told him, \"Come\n   with me so you can work and we can actually be a family,\" because my dad\n   had never seen him his whole life and my dad wanted a relationship with him\n   he said, \"Yes,\" and he said, \"Maybe I can have a better job over there and\n   stuff,\" and my grandfather was like, \"Come and I'll support you.\" So my dad\n   came and then later on, the next six months passed and he brought my mom\n   and then another year passed and then he brought me [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n   Anita: we hear about Americans exploiting\u2014\n \n \n   Melani: [Affirmative sound] and now it's Hispanics exploiting Hispanics.\n \n \n  "
