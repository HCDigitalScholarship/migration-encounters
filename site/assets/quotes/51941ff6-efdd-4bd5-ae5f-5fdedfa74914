I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.\n There was a point where one of my teachers\u2014one of my reading\n teachers\u2014basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching\n wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the\n book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.\n      \n      \n"
