But sometimes I question if\n   coming back here was the best choice or not.\n \n \n   Anita: let\u2019s pause the survey and talk\u2014\n \n \n   Melani: I guess it\u2019s because ... it's not home and people have a different\n   culture and different ways of thinking and there's just so many\n   differences. And when I came here it's just such a culture shock and I knew\n   I should adapt, but it's really hard because of the culture and the\n   mindset, which is more conservative. Back home it was more liberal and more\n   accepting of women and different ways of doing stuff - it wasn't church\n   oriented all the time [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah. So, you said \u201cback home.\u201d \u201cBack home\u201d for you is the US?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: You consider the US your home?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes, I consider it home.\n \n \n  "
