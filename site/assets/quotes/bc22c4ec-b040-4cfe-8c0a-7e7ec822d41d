Just feeling\n   more free, like I can go wherever I want. Police aren't going to be looking\n   at me, I don't have to worry about them. Whoa... Now with police are\n   assholes sometimes, I guess everywhere they're that way. They're like that\n   everywhere, right? But just that fear of like, \"I don't know what's going\n   to happen. They're just going to send me away\", and stuff like, \"I don't\n   know what's going to happen.\" I guess that's gone.\n \n \n  "
