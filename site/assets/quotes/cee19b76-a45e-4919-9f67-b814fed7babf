  "text":"Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of\n   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such\n   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of\n   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say\n   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a\n   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four\n   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my\n   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a\n   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.\n \n \n   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the\n   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I\n   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that\n   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned\n   black. I was like, \"Okay, this is not good.\" It did turn off. It did turn\n   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,\n   \"Okay.\" So, I was like, \"It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I\n   could just live with just one. That will be okay.\" I was trying to not pay\n   that much attention to that.\n \n \n   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It\n   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple\n   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,\n   \"Yeah, this is okay.\" I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing\n   for the phone. I was like, \"Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this\n   one.\" Then I got robbed. They took that phone\u2014\n \n \n   Isabel: In the same day?\n \n \n   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw\n   a couple of police officers, and I told them\u2014because he wasn't even\n   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, \"Yeah,\n   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?\" And they didn't\n   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was\n   trying to scam him. They were like, \"Yeah? He took your phone? And why do\n   you have one right there?\" And I was like, \"I can prove that they're both\n   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,\n   whatever you ask me.\" They told me that they couldn't\u2014how do you call that?\n \n \n   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?\n \n \n   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, \"Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure\n   that you can do that.\" It was like, \"No, there's no witnesses. We can't do\n   anything about it.\" I was like, \"Okay. I think I'm going to leave right\n   now.\" I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was\n   on that phone. I was like, \"I don't know how am I going to get to my\n   house,\" and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, \"Okay,\n   can you guys take me there?\" I said that to the police officers. They were\n   like, \"No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area.\" I was\n   like, \"So, what do I do now?\" They were like, \"Take a taxi.\" I was like,\n   \"Okay.\"\n \n \n   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police\n   officers, I was like, \"Yes! I'm going to get my things again!\" I didn't\n   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,\n   and I told them right there, \u201cI don't care if he goes to court or if\n   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press\n   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that\n   is my nice phone.\u201d\n \n \n   Isabel: You bought with your own money.\n \n \n   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to\n   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, \"What happened? You\n   look so sad.\" I was like, \"Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about\n   it in the morning.\" I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying\n   with her, and she was like, \"What happened?\" I was like, \u201cI don\u2019t know\n   where to start\u201d [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the\n   beginning.\n \n \n  "
