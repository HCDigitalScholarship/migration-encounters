  "text":"Hugo: My dad started working in the U.S., right? Because back in the day\n   you can cross easier and well in the towns, even in that day, like I\n   mentioned, you make less money. Even if you work hard, you make less money.\n   You have to own a business or do something to come up. And he went to the\n   States, we were living okay, but my mother didn't like that he was over\n   here all the time and then sometimes he would just come. So, her little\n   light bulb went off and she said, \"Either you take all of us, or I don't\n   know, you know? I know you send me money and I know you come from time to\n   time, but that's not it. I want to be with you.\"\n \n \n   Anne: And there were three of you?\n \n \n   Hugo: Three of us."
