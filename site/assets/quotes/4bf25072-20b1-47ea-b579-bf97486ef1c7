  "text":"Olimpya: Yes. There's more time than life. That's something I want. I just\n   want, even if it's for a day, just go back, step to United States, look\n   around, and remember everything that happened to me there. I'll be happy.\n   I'll be happy because I miss my house. I miss my family. [Emotional]. Even\n   though I got most of my family here, it's not the same. They don't care\n   about you. When I needed my kidney transplant, because I need one, and my\n   mom told my family that if anybody wanted to donate, nobody answered.\n   Nobody said, \"Hey, I can't, but I'll pray for you.\" Nobody. They just\n   changed the topic. When I told my family in the States that I needed a\n   kidney, my smallest cousin, he's around eighteen, he said, \"Hey, I'll give\n   it to you\" right away. It makes me feel like I don't need to see you every\n   day to be family. You're not my family. My family is in the States. They\n   are my family. They love me. They care about me.\n \n \n  "
