How did you know?\n \n \n   Anita: You said you broke up!\n \n \n   Jesus: You're following me around. [Laughs]\n \n \n   Anita: You said you broke up.\n \n \n   Jesus: No, we're trying to work things out. We did hang out last night, but\n   it's just two different cultures. It's hard to kind of wrap your mind\n   around being in a relationship, especially when my Spanish is m\u00e1s o menos.\n \n \n  "
