  "text":"Anita: Do you think that living in the U S changed you?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes, a lot.\n \n \n   Anita: How so?\n \n \n   Diana: I'm more open minded, and I see things different. I think I'm more\n   accepting of a lot of differences in people or in stuff. Because here I see\n   that people sometimes, they reject, people are different and something like\n   that. Also, the thing that I liked a lot more about that is that they do\n   take care more about animals and stuff like that. Over there my son, he got\n   so amazed how ... over there we never saw a stray dog. I mean, I'm pretty\n   sure sometimes they get loose, but you know they're not strays, and here\n   you see so many stray dogs and cats and stuff like that. So that's one of\n   the things that I like the most about there. They help a lot more.\n \n \n  "
