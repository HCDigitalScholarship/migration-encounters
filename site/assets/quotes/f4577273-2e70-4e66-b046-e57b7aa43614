Spiritually, me myself,\n   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living\n   the real life of a real life Mexican\u2014because man, it's hard out here, you\n   know?\u2014I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I\n   am. Because I have American\u2026 Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't\n   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?\n   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,\n   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my\n   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,\n   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,\n   yeah, I'm American.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my\n   own people, I'm a Mexican."
