  "text":"Axel: I'm more likely to get into a fight or into a physical altercation\n with somebody or even verbal altercation with someone, because of them\n saying something about somebody I care about than them saying... They could\n say the most horrible things about me and I just brush it off my shoulders.\n I really don't care because I know who I am. But if they anything either\n minor or whatever it is about somebody I care about, that upsets me a lot\n because they have no reason to say it, they don't know the person or the\n person's not even there. So I'm like, \"Hey.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: If the person is there, I'll be like, \"Hey, defend yourself, man.\"\n They're like me. They're like, \"It's not even true, I don't really care.\"\n I'm like, \"All right, cool. Let's just ignore them then.\" But I'm more\n likely like that. My mom told me that too. She's literally learned that on.\n She's like, \"Yeah, I noticed that.\" She's like, \"You have a heart of gold,\n but you let people take advantage of you and let people step over you and\n stuff like that.\" I'm like, \"I don't really care about that. I know what my\n life is, I know what I do with my life, I know exactly where I'm going,\n what I'm doing with my life. If people want to say all this stuff, okay.\n They can say it. I can either let it affect me and bring me down or I can\n let it affect me and I go at them or I go physically with them or go argue\n with them, whatever. Or I can just let them say what they want to say and\n act like nothing was said at all.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I was like, \"It's not affecting me.\" If it gets to the point where\n it's affecting me, like maybe they're talking about me and my wife or\n talking about me doing something that is going to upset my wife and now my\n wife is upset with me or something like that, it's causing problems in my\n personal life, then yeah. I will get upset at that point, but if you want\n to say, \"Hey, Axel's this, Axel's that, Axel did this and oh, he's this and\n that. I heard he also was into this.\" All right, cool. But if you say\n something like, \"Hey, did you know Axel was messing around with this girl\n and even his wife doesn't know?\" And then all of a sudden my wife is like,\n \"Oh, really?\" So now she's mad at me for something I didn't do just because\n they said it. Okay, so now I'm going to get upset because now you're making\n my wife, my ex, my girl, whatever it is, you're making my parents upset\n because of that.\n      \n      \n"
