  "text":"Claudia: Obviously, now that you're back, you've already done so many\n   amazing things, but what are your dreams? What else would you like to do\n   while you're here?\n \n \n   Ilse: Okay, well, right now, one of the things, meeting New Comienzos and\n   everything that they do, I want to help people. I know how tough it is to\n   come back, I know everything that you have to go through. I want to be\n   someone who helps them out. I don't know how, but that's one of the things\n   right now.\n \n \n   Ilse: I'm working on establishing my own company. I'm really excited about\n   that. I want to have something of my own, and I'm talking about short-term.\n   I want to start it already because I know so many people, I have all this\n   knowledge, I have everything. I just need to do it, you know? [Chuckle].\n   And that's one of my objectives\u2026dreams. It's always been a dream to have my\n   own company, but now, I have to make it a reality, and I have to work up to\n   that.\n \n \n   Ilse: I want to get married someday. [Laughs]. I've been single ever since\n   I came back. On a personal note, that would be amazing. And right now, I'm\n   just working so hard, I want to try and see if I can get my visa and be\n   able to visit my parents.\n \n \n   Claudia: Tell me about this company! What would your company be?\n \n \n   Ilse: [Laughs]. It's going to be, we call it a trading company because I\n   know a lot of brands nationally that need to be expanded. And I also do a\n   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in\n   Mexico. There's a lot of people who have the money, they have the people\n   who they're going to sell to, but they don't know, they don't have the\n   knowledge on how to do it, how to import, process everything. So, I want to\n   be able to help them out. So, not even just for me, but help brands grow,\n   help other people develop their business, as well. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
