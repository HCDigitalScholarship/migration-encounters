  "text":"Noe: Yeah, the community college. It was one year and a half only, but it\n   was only in generals before I decided what to do. I was undecided between\n   being a dentist or a medical assistant. I was just going to generals before\n   I decide, and I was making my own investigation about salaries\u2014first\n   priority was money, then timing, and then work bills and everything around\n   the community. Luckily, I didn't get to really get into the college about\n   my major. Well, after I return, I came to my small village\u2014\n \n \n  "
