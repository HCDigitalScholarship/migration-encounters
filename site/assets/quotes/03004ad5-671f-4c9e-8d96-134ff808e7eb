  "text":"Anita: Have you become aware of programs that support returning migrants?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes, like New Comienzos. My mom always told me before I would come,\n   \"You should be a part of New Comienzos. I found out about it on the\n   internet.\" And I said, \"No, I think I'll find my own way. I don't think\n   anybody could help me.\" And I came here and I was looking for a job and\n   opportunities and college and I went to the best university here, which is\n   UNAM [Universidad Nacional Aut\u00f3noma de M\u00e9xico]. And they told me that I\n   would have to start over since I don't have any knowledge of Mexican\n   history\u2014not even the National Anthem.\n \n \n  "
