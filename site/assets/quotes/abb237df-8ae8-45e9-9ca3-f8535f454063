  "text":"Ana: I think it'd be really great for people to just probably do this kind\n of thing, and I\u2019m grateful that someone started it, grateful that someone's\n doing it, and I really hope that it reaches a scope where everyone kind of\n becomes interested in this and not necessarily for my story or anyone's\n story, just because I think that sometimes humans forget we're all humans\n and it doesn't matter whether you're Afghani, whether you're Haitian,\n whether you're Dominican, Puerto Rican, et cetera, whether you're... So,\n it's important to know that no matter what background you come from, you're\n human, you just have to get to know the person. Yeah, there are assholes\n out there, of course. Everyone has that. Yes, there are really nice people\n and awesome people, but it's just the person and not their background. So\n that's it.\n      \n      \n"
