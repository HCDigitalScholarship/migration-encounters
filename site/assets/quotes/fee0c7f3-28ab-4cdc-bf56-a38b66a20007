  "text":"immy: So, he would start looking for jobs where he said, \u201cIf I weld this,\n   just to do it, because this whole thing costs like 10,000 pesos, they're\n   already like, \u2018I'm getting paid, I don't know, 3000 for it. Y nada mas\u2019\u201d\n   Like 10 minutes of doing it, the company was already getting paid thousands\n   of pesos for it. And he was only getting paid like 1,000 and change a week.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, he's like, \"I'm working for this company that's making\n   thousands of pesos, y a mi nada mas me pagan 1000 pesos a la semana. \"\n   [they are only paying me 1000 pesos a week] So he didn't like that. He's\n   like, \"They're not paying me enough for what I know how to do.\" So he\n   started looking for more and more jobs, and he started noticing that jobs\n   that have nothing to do what he does pay more than what he actually knows\n   how to do.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So he became like chofer de metrobus,[bus driver] he became like\n   taxista, [taxi driver] and he's like, \"I don't like this. I don't like\n   being a chofer. [driver] I want to do what I like doing. But it's not paid\n   well here, so I want to go back to the States and work over there.\" So\n   yeah, that's basically why he wants to go back.\n \n \n  "
