  "text":"My brother and I graduated high school. We were looking to our\n   future\u2014everything was doing good. We were looking into getting a house.\n   Sometimes I do feel guilty. I\u2019m like, because of the situation that\n   happened for me, my parents' plans, they all went downhill and I'm just\n   glad that they \u2026 Because one thing that I remember is that when they first\n   took me in jail, they're like, \"You have one call.\"\n \n \n   Juan: I called my dad and I was crying. I was like, \"Dad, I'm in jail.\" He\n   was like, \"Why?\" I'm like, \"They're accusing me of this.\" And he just said,\n   \"Don't say anything. We're going to get a lawyer and just hang in there.\"\n   My dad, he did everything in his power to help me out. He didn't know what\n   happened [Emotional], but he believed in me because he knew that the kind\n   of person that I was, and so then my mom ... All my friends, they didn't\n   help me at all. It was my parents who went to the trials and stuff like\n   that. [Chuckles]\n \n \n  "
