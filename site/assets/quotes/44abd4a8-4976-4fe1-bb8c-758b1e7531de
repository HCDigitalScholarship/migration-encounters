  "text":"Donovan: It wasn't, I don't want to say that it was nice, but it wasn't\n   bad. They gave us really good to eat. The only thing that I didn't like,\n   when I got boarded in the Oakland airport, that I got did the whole\n   transportation to , they made us stay three days awake. You go on the\n   plane, then it's on bus. Then you send you from shelter to shelter, and\n   it's just, you're inside a basketball court, a school court full of 400,\n   500 people. You sleep wherever you want to. It's just, and then they wake\n   you up, you almost never sleep. I remember that I was 72 hours awake and it\n   was just crazy. It was just hectic. But once get into the immigration\n   center, it's pretty chill.\n \n \n  "
