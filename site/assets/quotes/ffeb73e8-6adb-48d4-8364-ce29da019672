  "text":"Ruben: Yeah, actually, we're in Mexico, I'm seeing a way to do a life that\n   I want to do. Maybe I cannot go to school and graduate from some type of\n   career, but I can work and be free. I can walk anywhere I want. I don't\n   have to watch my back and say, \"What neighborhood am I in?\". The only thing\n   in Mexico is at night, yeah, it's a little dangerous. Depends on the area\n   you're in, but you don't have to worry about other gang members trying to\n   shoot you or looking for you. I had an experience where we were buying\n   groceries and four people walked in the store, the store was called Chia.\n   They walked up to me, put the gun to my head and said, \"Is that your mom\n   right there behind you?\" And I said \"Yes, she is.\" \"Well, you better thank\n   her, because she just gave you life again.\"\n \n \n  "
