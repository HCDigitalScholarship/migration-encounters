  "text":"Jose: Yeah, the language was a very difficult thing, but I knew I had to\n   get my act together and learn English as quick as possible. There's a bunch\n   of classes in the States that teach foreign kids to learn English. Whether\n   you're from any Latin American country, Asia, or whatever. I remember being\n   an ESL and I remember being surrounded by Hispanics, Asians, and there was\n   like a Russian kid.\n \n \n  "
