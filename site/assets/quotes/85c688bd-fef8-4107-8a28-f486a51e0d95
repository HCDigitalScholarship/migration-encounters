  "text":"Axel: The train stations are three blocks away, the bus is maybe two blocks\n away, and within that little range, it's probably the biggest mission ever.\n People talk about the areas where they have all the drugs, they beat them\n or places like that where it's supposedly heavy, and really, I've gone to\n those areas because I have friends and people that live in those areas and\n I've gone to visit them, and the cops are there in that area, they're right\n outside of the locations where they're selling stuff. They can smell the\n stuff, they can see people going in and out of the place, but they don't go\n in the place. They do checks on everybody that comes out of there, to try\n to see if maybe they can catch them slipping up and get some money off of\n them, a phone, whatever they can, but they will never go inside of the\n location where they see everybody going in and out of.\n      \n      \n"
