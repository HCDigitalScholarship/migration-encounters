  "text":"Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the\n   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a\n   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that\n   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.\n \n \n   Anne: Did you make friends?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah I did, a lot. [Chuckles]. But in high school.\n \n \n   Anne: Were they from all different?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, I actually have a lot of friends. I have a Muslim friend\n   actually. They were all different cultures because I went to a bilingual\n   school as well, a bilingual high school."
