  "text":"Carlos: The most important one is finish high school. After that, I want to\n   study software engineer, and I like it a lot. I like it a lot. I want to\n   get into a good job. Right now, I have a girlfriend. When I needed it, she\n   was there for me. I have a very good relationship with her, and I feel a\n   lot of love for her. If things can happen in the future, I'm willing to\n   take it. I'd take it. I'll take it because not a lot of girls will help you\n   the way she helped me, because most of them are not interested on who you\n   are or what you need, and she was in the moment when I needed it.\n \n \n  "
