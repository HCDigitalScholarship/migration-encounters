I mean, a lot of people, a lot of my friends\n   ended up joining gangs and getting shot, arrested, and all that stuff.\n \n \n   Anne: You never did?\n \n \n   Jose: Not for the things they were getting arrested for. I was arrested for\n   traffic violations and stuff like that.\n \n \n   Anne: But you never joined a gang?\n \n \n   Jose: No.\n \n \n  "
