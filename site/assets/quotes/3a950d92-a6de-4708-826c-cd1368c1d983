Then when I started getting to\n   know them a little bit more, and then started speaking more English, then I\n   started getting Mexicans that were born there, they\u2019re called Chicanos.\n   Other Mexicans. Pretty much, it was Mexicans.\n \n \n   Anita: Did you have any friends that weren't Chicano or Mexican?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Pretty much in the beginning it was Mexicans. Then after that, it\n   was more Chicanos too.\n \n \n   Anita: What about others?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Not really. Not in California.

Were there other kind of people at school? Or was\n   everybody at school Mexican or Chicano?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No, I mean, it was ... How can I say it? Because I didn't know\n   enough English. They would put you aside. Not aside, but they would put\n   you, \"Okay, you don't talk English, you have to go to ESL class.\" \"Okay,\n   you're American, you're fine, you went to English class.\" It was different\n   because all of the Mexicans, that we didn't know English, we were all in\n   the same classes.\n \n \n  "
