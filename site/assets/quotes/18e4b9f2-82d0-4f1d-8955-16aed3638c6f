  "text":"Donovan: It's depressed. You feel like you're alone. You feel like you're\n   worthless. And then you feel sometimes like this is what I deserve. Well\n   personally me, because I haven't been a good person. I'm not going to lie.\n   I've done a lot of bad shit, but this is what I deserve. This is what I did\n   in my life. This is what I caused for myself. If I were to listen to my\n   mom, it would have been a little bit different. But you feel just like a\n   loner, and then you come here and they segregate you because you can't talk\n   good Spanish. So it just, you feel like a piece of shit. If you're not able\n   to handle it, it tears you apart. It's really hard. But the food of Mexico\n   is amazing. The culture here is, you see really where your roots come from.\n   You're like, \u201cDamn, I'm a fucking amazing person. Who has culture like\n   this?\u201d I don't think there's like another country that can compare itself\n   to Mexico, in the food, the culture, in all that's happened to us. When I\n   was younger with the same teacher that adopted me, she's an Aztec dancer. I\n   had already knew about the Aztec culture. I was an Aztec dancer when I was\n   smaller, so I'm really fond of Aztec Mayan culture. She's Native American,\n   she's Apache. She sent me a lot, and then you look at that and like, now I\n   see why Mexican people are so happy, why we are so up and going. Because\n   that's how you got to be out here\u2014you got to stick out like a sore thumb.\n \n \n  "
