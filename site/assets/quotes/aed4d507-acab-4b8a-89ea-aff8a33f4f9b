  "text":"Mike: And you know what's crazy? My mom actually signed us up for this\n   program. It's called Visa U , which is a process for the immigration and\n   it's just one route that you could go.\n \n \n   Mike: She signed us up, but the people that were doing all the paperwork\n   for us basically lied to us and basically committed fraud, because they\n   told us that through this for certain we were going to be able to get\n   papers, because we went through some kind of a violence.\n \n \n   Anne: With your dad?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. But they didn't tell us that if he wasn't from there, that it\n   didn't apply to us. And since he's not a resident, or he's not anything,\n   they just took it all away. But they gave me a social security card. They\n   gave me a work permit. They gave me everything that I needed. I even got my\n   taxes one year [Emotional]. I got $3,000 back, put my taxes on my wall,\n   like I'm really doing it.\n \n \n   Mike: But then out of nowhere, stripped everything from us. We didn't know\n   what to do. There was no... Just got to go back to the old things that we\n   were doing. But luckily, I was able to cut hair and do tattoos, and I was\n   able to get by.\n \n \n   Anne: So the violence that you encountered didn't qualify, because the\n   perpetrator was not a us citizen. Is that what it is?\n \n \n   Mike: Yes. Which was my father at the time.\n \n \n   Mike: And then when they strip that away, that's when you kind of want to\n   take your anger out, because you're like, \"Wow. What else can I go\n   through?\" And then it starts raining just kind of like that scenario. But\n   yeah, it's hard. It's hard.\n \n \n  "
