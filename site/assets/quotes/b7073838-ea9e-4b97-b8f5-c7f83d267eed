  "text":"Joana: I wanted to be a veterinarian. That was my dream. Or a teacher. I\n   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone\n   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do\n   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot\n   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.\n   They're like, \"Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.\"\n   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.\n \n \n  "
