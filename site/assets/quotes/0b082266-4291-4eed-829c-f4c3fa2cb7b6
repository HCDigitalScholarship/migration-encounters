  "text":"Zayuri: She was like, \"No. You are keeping your hair down, because you\n   cannot show your ears.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" And the same thing for my\n   tattoos too. She was like, \"You need to cover them up because they're not\n   professional.\" I was like, \"It's like 40 degrees outside. It's really hot\n   in here,\" especially because the classrooms are sometimes so tiny that it\n   gets so hot in there. I was like, \"You see, I'm not even trying to fight\n   with you anymore. I'm going to die of a heat stroke if you don't allow me\n   to take my jacket off.\" But she was very rude about that.\n \n \n  "
