  "text":"Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when\n   they got here. A lot of these guys think, \"Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just\n   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me\n   something.\" and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, \"Hey man,\n   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.\" People will\n   be like \"Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.\" I work right here.\n   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.\n   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,\n   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does\n   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his\n   money.\n \n \n   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, \"I seen you on\n   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your\n   stuff.\" And he goes, \"I never seen you taking money. I never see you not\n   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how\n   much did you make?\" No, he just comes and be like, \"Hey, thanks man. Are\n   you hungry? Do you need anything?\" He'll give you money, and on the side\n   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, \"No man, you don't have to\n   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay\n   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the\n   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.\"\n   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que\n   me vean diferente (I don\u2019t want to be seen differently), you know?\n \n \n  "
