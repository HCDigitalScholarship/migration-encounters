  "text":"Anita: Yeah. [Pause] let's continue [with the survey] and we'll come back\n   to this. I totally get you. Did you follow US news when you were in the\n   states?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: How did you follow it? Through family and friends, social media, TV,\n   radio, newspapers?\n \n \n   Melani: Newspapers and TV, and I also worked in a coalition which helped\n   immigrants. I was there for four years and I helped kids apply for DACA\n   [Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals] and stuff. I never applied because\n   I was scared. My parents told me I shouldn't apply since you have to go\n   give all your fingerprints and your information. They said, \u201cWhat if it all\n   falls down and we're the first ones to get deported?\u201d\n \n \n  "
