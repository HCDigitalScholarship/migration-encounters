  "text":"Jesus: Changing a government, the thing that has been established for over\n decades, is like changing religion. [Laughs]. It's one of the hardest\n things to do. In religion, all the religions teach the same thing. Love one\n another, peace. So why can't all of them be just one religion? But, no.\n It's just separation. It's just changing separation, having to unify people\n when everybody's already separated, they've been like that for decades,\n takes a lot of people. I think the solution to that would be just unifying\n the country, and making that one goal, one human goal. The one goal that\n every human could have, and everybody could have access to food and shelter\n and stuff, but based on wanting the people to grow, want their knowledge to\n grow, because more people put their minds on one thing. It's easier for it\n to be done, it's proven. You get five people to flip a car over, they'll do\n it. If one person tries, they're never going to do it. So just changing\n everybody's mindsets and having the opportunity for everybody to live\n correctly, I think that would make a better world. It would help everybody\n use their minds for other things than just work. They could use it for\n their creative sides where they could start creating things that could help\n better mankind as a whole. Like free energy. Water is infinite\u2014not really,\n because we're killing it, you know? [Laughs].\n      \n      \n"
