  "text":"[53:02] Yeah. Maybe not coming back. I was really excited. I was like, \"Oh,\n   yeah. I'm going to go back to Mexico and everything's going to go perfect\n   because I'm Mexican.\" I came back and I tried to go to school. It was too\n   expensive. I either had to work or study but I didn't have the money to\n   study. I wanted to be a welder. I tried to do it here in Mexico, but they\n   didn't pay at all. They didn't pay well at all. My uncle told me to become\n   a teacher. I didn't want to, obviously. Who wants to be a teacher of other\n   children? I saw the potential. All my cousins say, \"Hey, you teach me\n   English because they're asking me at my job to have a percentage.\" Friends\n   telling me, \"Hey, teach me English,\" or including meeting girls. They were\n   like, \"Hey, you speak English? You should come teach me.\" \"Oh, yeah. Why\n   not?\"\n \n \n  "
