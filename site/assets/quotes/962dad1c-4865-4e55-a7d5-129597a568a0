  "text":"Zayuri: Oh, yeah, yeah. Now I remember. She got in the bus, and the buses\n   in Zacatecas have these sensors that, every time you step in, they make a\n   noise. You have to get away from the line because they start to charge\n   more. It's like every person gets a beep, and that's one ticket. So, if you\n   stand there and it beeps twice, you have to pay twice. She wasn't getting\n   away from there and the bus driver got angry. She didn't understood why the\n   driver was angry, so I will say to you, \"You need to get out of the line.\"\n   She was like, \"Okay.\"\n \n \n  "
