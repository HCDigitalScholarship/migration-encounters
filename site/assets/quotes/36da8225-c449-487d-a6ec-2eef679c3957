  "text":"Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was\n   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes\u2026 how do\n   you say\u2026 saying that there was not delivered their paper.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Like a complaint?\n \n \n   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their\n   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers\n   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our\n   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to\n   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being\n   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of\n   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be\n   affecting you.\n \n \n  "
