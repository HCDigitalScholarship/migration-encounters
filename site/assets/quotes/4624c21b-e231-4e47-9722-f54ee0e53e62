  "text":"Dan: On the news on the US. There were tents and then they were made to\n   wear pink underwear and that's how they were treated there in Maricopa in\n   Arizona. Well, here, it was tents as well. I know I was a load to my\n   family's shoulders. I know they had to come over and visit me. They had to\n   send me money. When my wife was selling all my tools and all my property, I\n   just told her, \"Send me $150.\" I bought a lot of ... It's called\n   commissary, which it's a lot of food, quick soups, beans, Cokes, all that.\n   I bought tons. And it is common that people that has money, they put a\n   little store. You sell a Coke and when pay day comes, they give you a Coke\n   and they give you a soup. For everything that you sell, it is a soup as\n   interest. So I start building up my store inside and I didn't have to\n   bother my mom or my sisters, my wife. I was supporting myself over there.\n   That happened throughout the two years and half. By the time it was three\n   months before I got out, I start eating all my food with all my friends,\n   the inmates that I kind of got to know as friends. There were other people\n   that had stores and they were about to leave about the same time. So we\n   were eating everything and so we were sharing with all the inmates there.\n \n \n   Isabel: You created your own mini business again inside to support yourself\n   so your family wouldn't have to. Can you tell me about ... Were your\n   friends in similar situations, they were undocumented and sent here?\n \n \n   Dan: Yeah. The people that were there, they were undocumented as well. And\n   they have a little bit more years to serve than me. There were some of them\n   that they just that were very few months depending on what they did. There\n   were people that were just pulled over because they didn't have a\n   taillight. And it was very, very unbelievable stories that you would hear.\n   Everybody was there for different reasons.\n \n \n  "
