  "text":"Axel: I get mad about stuff as if I was an OCD type thing. I would get mad\n because somebody grabbed something and then leaves it over here on the\n couch and doesn't put it back on the table. I'll get mad at stuff like\n that. That upsets me more than, \"Hey, this person's talking bad about you.\"\n My mom is really picky about that. My family members are really nosy.\n They're always like, \"Hey, did you see what Axel published on Facebook?\" I\n mean, it could be just a funny picture about a certain thing, but just\n because I posted it, they think I'm doing those things or I'm into those\n things. I'm like, it's just something I found funny and I wanted to share\n with people. I'm not doing it.\n      \n      \n Axel: My mom's like, \"You know how your family is.\" So now it got to the\n point where I can't even express myself on social media just because of my\n family? I'm like, \"Mom, you know that I'm not doing that stuff. You talk to\n me every day. And they're not helping me, they're not supporting me,\n they're not doing anything for me. So why let them affect anything that has\n to do with me?\" She's like, \"I just don't like telling me.\" I'm like,\n \"Ignore them, block them. If they're really family, they shouldn't be doing\n that type of stuff.\"\n      \n      \n"
