  "text":"My mom she did not really say anything about that because I actually\n   told her that I wanted to get a job because I was not doing good in school.\n   So she was like, \"Okay, well, if you're going to do better by having a job,\n   then just get a job. I'll help you get a job.\" Then she basically talked to\n   one of her friends that she had, and he helped me to get a job. So I\n   started working when I was 15. It was at a carpet mill.\n \n \n   Isabel: What did you do there?\n \n \n   Pablo: We would get, how do you call them, big rolls of carpet? We would\n   just have machines to cut them in different sizes and...\n \n \n   Isabel: Big machines?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: Were they dangerous?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah, because they're cutting machines and...\n \n \n   Isabel: Did they know you were 15? Or did you have to say?\n \n \n   Pablo: They didn't know I was 15 because I was obviously using a fake ID.\n   So I was 15, but on that fake ID, I would supposedly be 27.\n \n \n   Isabel: Oh, wow.\n \n \n   Pablo: I mean they knew, but that's just how it is.\n \n \n  "
