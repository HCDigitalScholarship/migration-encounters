  "text":"Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually\n   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of\n   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so\n   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,\n   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,\n   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.\n \n \n  "
