  "text":"Jeimmy: I think it's because when you're a teenager over there, it's like\n   your parents, they worry on giving you material stuff. In the States, the\n   government helps you with food vouchers, there's Goodwill, there's\n   Salvation Army where you can go to the store and buy Levi jeans for a\n   dollar or two. So it's like the government actually helps you. Like, \"If\n   you're poor, it's fine. We'll help you feed yourself and we'll help you\n   with clothes. All you have to do is like, I don't know, just put in $20 for\n   a cell phone.\"\n \n \n  "
