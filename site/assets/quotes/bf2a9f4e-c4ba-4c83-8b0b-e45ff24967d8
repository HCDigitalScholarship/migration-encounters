  "text":"Mike: Yeah. And it takes a long time the process for immigration. So I had\n   some time there, actually I was like a year and a half, where I was doing\n   everything legal. Doing my taxes, getting my taxes back, just doing\n   everything that normal US citizens got to do. And then just one day I got\n   that letter in the mail and I just had to give it all up.\n \n \n   Mike: I remember we had to go in this office, we gave everything back and\n   then they told us like, \"Basically don't get in trouble, because that's\n   your ass\" [Chuckle]. I was just stunned. I'm like, \"How could people do you\n   like...\" You know what I mean? Especially me growing up, I wanted to be\n   something in my community. I wanted to change for the better. I felt like I\n   could have contributed to my community, not only to my community, but\n   basically just become something that people look up to or follow. But it\n   didn't work out like it does.\n \n \n  "
