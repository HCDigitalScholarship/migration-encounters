My mom\n already had my stepdad kind of on the side and my dad knew my stepdad,\n actually. They actually used to be coworkers together, so even to this day,\n they still talk to each other and they get along whenever it comes down to\n family situations, they get along. They can sit in front of each other and\n talk and stuff. But once they separated, that's when my mom had my\n stepsister, my stepbrother and my other stepsister. As in my dad and my\n mom, I was the only child.\n      \n      \n"
