  "text":"Dan: Yes. I'm very organized. Obviously, that came from my parents. I'm\n   very perfectionist. Yes, definitely. In here, if you go around the\n   buildings anywhere, pick a street, whenever they paint a building, you can\n   see a bunch of dripping on the floor on the sidewalks. That's where I make\n   the difference in my job. If I do something, I do it better, and people\n   like it. And even treat with a person. You say \"Hi,\" you say, \"Good\n   afternoon,\" \"Good morning,\" and you get yourself to know by other people as\n   an educated, respected person. Not everybody's like this, and I learn it\n   from the States. You treat people the way you want to be treated. And\n   that's basically where I got my reputation from. You treat everybody the\n   way you want to be treated no matter where they're at, no matter who you\n   are, no matter who they are. That's my motto.\n \n \n  "
