  "text":"Ruben: Yes and no. Well, I mean, you know, yes because they would actually,\n   showed us some good ways to become a good person. You know, I've seen right\n   here in Mexico that if you're in a bus and an old lady comes up in a bus,\n   they won't give her the seat and you know, they'll act like they're asleep.\n   They showed us to, to respect our elders. They showed us a lot of good\n   stuff, and they never mistreated us like hit us or spank us or pulled our\n   hair. None of that. But I liked it. My sister didn't like it. She wanted to\n   be with my mom. But when my mom came and we were leaving, my grandpa didn't\n   want us to leave. You know, we had become like his kids. That's where my\n   mom actually came to pick us up. She even gave us the choice. Do you want\n   to stay? You can stay. She was like, you want to go with me? We're going to\n   go back to the United States. So I had like two days to think about it and\n   it was hard because my grandpa, he loved me a lot. He would take me to, he\n   had like a little ranch and he would have fun with me because he would tell\n   me to grab... By 12 he said you should have two chickens. It was two\n   o'clock in the afternoon. I still didn't have one, but you know, he taught\n   me how to cut the corn.\n \n \n   Ruben: Well he had such a big ranch. He had everything there. He didn't\n   have to buy any vegetables. He had peas, he had cows, he had chickens, he\n   had everything. And he would always make sure school was a priority. He\n   would always tell us that no matter what your school is your priority, you\n   got to finish, you got to graduate. And he was into that political stuff so\n   he wanted me to be like that. And he would take me to his reunions. We\n   would make about 600 sandwiches and give them to the people that will come\n   and you know, hear him speak.\n \n \n   Anita: But he was a politician?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah, I don't remember what it was, but I remember he used to take\n   me to the reunions and I would be passing out the sandwiches while he'll be\n   up in the stand speaking to the people and all of that I liked, you know,\n   waking up at 4:30 in the morning I did not like."
