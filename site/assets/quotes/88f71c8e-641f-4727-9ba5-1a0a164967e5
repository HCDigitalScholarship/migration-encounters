You can't share this anxiety that you\n   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd\n   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled\n   over? My mom\u2014she\u2019s an amazing driver\u2014but what if she got pulled over? What\n   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing\n   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the\n   shadows. Nobody really knows.\n \n \n  "
