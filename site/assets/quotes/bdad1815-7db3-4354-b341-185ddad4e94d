  "text":"Josue: Coming back? Like of the entire process? I mean, being with ICE was\n   horrible. And it's horrible because... So the people that have you\n   detained, like in Tacoma, they're all American. And they never really\n   mistreated us, not really. But whenever they turned us over in San Diego\n   with ICE, they all got their last names right here, and every single one of\n   them was Latino. You know, \u2018cause they got their last names right there.\n   They were the ones, you know, that had us up against the bus with our hands\n   up with the guns pulled out.\n \n \n   Josue: There\u2019s a lot of them. So yeah, they're the ones that were screaming\n   at us. They never spoke Spanish, it was always English. I remember one of\n   the guys, \u2018cause they had us walk in from the airplane to the bus with our\n   hands up, and I think somebody put them down\u2014I mean we're still shackled\n   up, you know, everything. And they put them down and they all like started\n   screaming at him, pointing the gun on him too. So that to me was like the\n   worst of the entire thing. Just having somebody that, you know, they're all\n   Latinos, treat you that way. I think that was the worst. And I don't know.\n   Maybe the other part is the place that you go into after, right when you\n   cross the border, they don't really give you any information.\n \n \n  "
