  "text":"Anne: What about school? Is that where you learned English?\n      \n      \n Brenda: Yes, as soon as I got into school, I remember I took preschool\n twice because I started at three years old and the next year I still wasn't\n old enough. So, I did it again. I remember the first year and not\n understanding a lot when I first got there. Then I recall the second year\n when I first started preschool being like, \u201cOh my gosh, I understand\n everything. I know what they're saying, okay!\u201d And just being really happy\n that I was understanding because I had promised my dad I was going to learn\n English when I got there.\n      \n      \n"
