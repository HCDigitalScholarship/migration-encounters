Because\nthey would see that I had little tattoos and stuff, but they wouldn't ... I\nmean, they would see my friends as the kids I grew up with. They didn't see\nthem as gang members. They knew them as so-and-so's son, and so-and-so's\ndaughter. I mean, your mom's always going to think you're an angel no\nmatter what you do.\n      \n      "
