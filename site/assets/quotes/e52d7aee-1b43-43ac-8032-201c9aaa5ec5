And then we were moved to\n the elementary school where we finished our studies. I remember my\n childhood in terms of like school and friends and such, but the first\n memories of arriving there, I don't recall.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Can you tell me about then your childhood, both your schools and\n your friends?\n      \n      \n Ana: Yeah. I don't remember much about my bilingual school. I just remember\n that we were there a year, then in the other school where we finished. I\n remember the school itself, the physical-ness of it, the weather. I\n remember that I was a huge nerd. [Laughs]. I just focused on reading and\n doing my schoolwork and finishing school and, yeah.\n      \n      \n"
