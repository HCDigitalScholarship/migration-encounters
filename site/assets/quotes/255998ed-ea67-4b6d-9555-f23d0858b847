  "text":"Exactly. Not to get money. Well, they actually are taking advantage of it\n     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the\n     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by\n     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce\n     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by\n     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn\n     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little\n     while and they're just like, \"Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,\n     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.\u201d I'm laughing at all of it, \"Yeah you did.\n     Yes.\" We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy\n     Story song and I was like, \"Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.\"\n     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in\n     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning\n     and move on.\n \n \n    "
