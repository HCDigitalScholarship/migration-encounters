  "text":"Laila: Well, I was actually three years old when my parents decided to go\n   to the States looking for I guess, a better life. That's what my mom has\n   always told me. She took me and my nine-year-old brother across the border\n   walking when they decided to go. My dad actually went first and then we\n   went second. I lived there for around thirteen years, mostly all my life.\n   Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You surely were too young to have any memories of walking across the\n   border or\u2014\n \n \n   Laila: I vaguely remember it was very cold because it was nighttime. We\n   actually got detained four times before being able to cross.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. One time the border patrol was actually very nice to us and\n   gave us water and all that, but that was a very long time ago.\n \n \n   Lizzy: And you say one time they were nice to you out of four times?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you know what the other times were like?\n \n \n   Laila: Well, mostly from my mom that she has actually told me most of what\n   happened. She says that the first couple of times we were detained, they\n   were just taken back and left at the border. Just go away, go home. There\n   was one time she was actually carrying me. She actually carried me the\n   whole time because I was three so and she says it was around rain time. The\n   shrubs were very tall and all the spines and all that. She didn't want me\n   to get injured, but she actually fell on a rock and got a hole in her knee\n   and she couldn't walk. When the border patrol saw that, they aided her and\n   they gave us water and they wanted to help her. They couldn't really give\n   her medical treatment, but they just helped her get back across the border.\n   She says that one of them told her to go home. Not risk her kids and there\n   was no reason for that. [Pause] There was no reason for that [Chuckle], but\n   I guess my mom says she's very stubborn. So she wanted to reunite her\n   family and we were able to cross on the fifth time [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
