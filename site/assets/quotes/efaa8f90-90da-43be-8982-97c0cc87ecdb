  "text":"They were super, super happy. He was actually the first generation\n   of our family to go to college. He wasn't able to finish because school was\n   very expensive, and he didn't have a scholarship so it was very difficult\n   for our parents. And as for my father got deported, well it was even more\n   difficult for him to continue studying.\n \n \n   Laila: But he was like the straight-A student. Very smart, very dedicated.\n   His last year of high school he was actually taking university classes. He\n   was in trigonometry and all of that, taking that in his last year of high\n   school, when most of them weren't even close to that. He was a very hard\n   worker at school, but he didn't have the chance to stay. Specifically,\n   because it was a lot more expensive for immigrant people to go to school\n   than for people born in the States.\n \n \n  "
