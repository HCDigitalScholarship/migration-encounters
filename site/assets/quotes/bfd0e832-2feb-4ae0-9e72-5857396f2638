  "text":"Diana: Oh, about the US. I like the rules. I like the rules. Because you\n   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started\n   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are\n   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you\u2019re\n   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see\n   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not\n   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the\n   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows\n   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.\n   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The\n   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped\n   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack\n   and it\u2019s like, why do you need his backpack?\n \n \n  "
