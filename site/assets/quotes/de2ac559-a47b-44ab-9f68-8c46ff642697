There's a\n   law, that probably won\u2019t get passed in the Senate but just got passed in\n   the house, that basically says that if someone like you, graduates from\n   high school, or is on the way to graduating from high school and hasn't\n   gotten in trouble, you can get a conditional residence\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: Right.\n \n \n   Anne: And get a social security card for ten years. Ten years conditional\n   residence. And then if you get employed in three years during that time you\n   can get permanent legal access.\n \n \n   Mike: Oh, okay. So that was the Trump administration when they came to an\n   agreement, right?\n \n \n  "
