  "text":"Juan: I miss everything. I miss everything. There's one thing, the United\n   States is a country of laws. It's a country of order. And that's one thing\n   that I loved because I used to feel safe over there. I used to feel safe\n   and I got nothing but good things to say about the United States. Because\n   the United States gave me more opportunities than my own country gave me.\n   And, I got nothing but love for the United States. As a matter of fact,\n   when the war started in Iraq, I even wanted to go and fight for the United\n   States. Not expecting anything in return, I just wanted to do that because\n   they gave me so many opportunities that my own country never gave me. And I\n   love the United States and that's my family's country. And I certainly, I\n   just thought it was mine too. And I got nothing but good things to say\n   about the United States.\n \n \n  "
