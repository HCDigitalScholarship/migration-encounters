I didn't do anything with the blessings that I got.\"\n   I felt bad. But in a way I feel like everything is for a reason.\n \n \n   Mike: I feel like I'm here for a reason and whatever I need to do to help,\n   or whatever my little part I have to put in, I feel like this is why I'm\n   here, and I'm just waiting on that so I could go back and just be with my\n   kids.\n \n \n  "
