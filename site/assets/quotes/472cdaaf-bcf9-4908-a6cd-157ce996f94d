  "text":"Ilse: When you come back from the States and you went to high school, and\n   you want to validate that you actually finished high school, you have to do\n   certain process in Mexico. I knew that before I came back; I tried to get\n   all my documents ready and everything, but the system here is so slow, and\n   I still had to lose a year of college, and I couldn't go because my\n   paperwork wasn't turned in.\n \n \n   Ilse: I was able to apply to a public college, Instituto Polit\u00e9cnico\n   Nacional. I made it, but the classes and everything didn't give me time to\n   work, and at the time, I had agreed with my dad that I wasn't ever going to\n   ask for any help, like monetary help. So, I decided to decline that, and\n   look for a private college. And I did. I found a really good college who\n   allowed me, they allowed me to work full-time and go to college full-time.\n   So, I majored in international business and commerce, my dream career, and\n   I went to college for four years while working.\n \n \n  "
