  "text":"Anita: Tell me about being undocumented. When did you know? What was it\n   like?\n \n \n   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just \u2026 I\n   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my\n   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things\n   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family\n   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.\n   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good\n   stories from him. [Laughs]\n \n \n   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me\u2014and I mean\n   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every\n   single day at her home or her grandparents\u2019 home. If my mom couldn't find\n   me, she'd call L___\u2019s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my\n   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, \"Hey. Could you\n   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have\n   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.\" All family events I\n   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.\n   We were best friends.\n \n \n   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks\n   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared\n   like a deer in the headlights. \u201cNo, I'm not. I'm not.\u201d I was so scared of\n   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody\u2014an ex-girlfriend, I think\n   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we\n   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we\n   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So\n   I was not allowed to tell anyone.\n \n \n   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of\n   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed\n   to tell this? This is a secret and\u2014\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.\n   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty\n   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I\n   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science\n   Facility\u2014research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in\u2014I'm not\n   sure what kind of testing they're doing there\u2014[Chuckles] but they ask you\n   if you're an American citizen or not.\n \n \n   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, \"I am\n   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.\" She was put\n   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in\n   there and that was very \u2026 that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm\n   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody\n   ever knew.\n \n \n  "
