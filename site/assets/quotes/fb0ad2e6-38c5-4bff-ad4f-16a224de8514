And it became even more scary\n   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and\n   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was\n   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us\n   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?\n \n \n  "
