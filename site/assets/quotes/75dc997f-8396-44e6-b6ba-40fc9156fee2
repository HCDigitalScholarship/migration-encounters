If I wanted to do\n   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.\n   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my\n   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always\n   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you\n   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]\n \n \n  "
