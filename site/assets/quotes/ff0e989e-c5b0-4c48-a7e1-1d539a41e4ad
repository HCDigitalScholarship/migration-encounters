  "text":"Juan: And that is just my hope. That this interview can really make someone\n   do something about it. I really would like for this to get to the right\n   ears and really get something about it. They are wasting the immigrant\n   talent. They are wasting everything, all these good people, bilingual\n   people, hard-working people. They are falling between the cracks because\n   these people, they're not paying attention to what is happening here.\n \n \n   Juan: We know of many people, they're very talented and they can't get\n   opportunities because they don't have an ID. For Christ's sake, they don't\n   have an identification to get a job. I just know of a friend of mine, she\n   was interviewed twice, and getting very good bilingual jobs. And she\n   couldn't take them because she didn't have the identification to take the\n   job. And that, it hurts. It hurts very much to see people struggle like\n   that. Being discriminated and kicked out of a country that don't really\n   like them. And then you're just hoping to make it work here in their own\n   country, when all this government and these politicians and these people in\n   key spots, all they care about is their pockets. All they care is their own\n   pockets, they don't care about nothing else.\n \n \n  "
