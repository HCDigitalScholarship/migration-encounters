I was struggling over here, and it was not easy.\n   So, I told her, \"You know what? I don't think it's a good idea. Because\n   things are different, and you're not going to like it, and I don't want to\n   tell you, 'Yes, come on over here and we're going to be fine.' And then\n   what if you don't like it and then you get mad and you're going to be like,\n   'It's your fault I came over here.'\" I didn't want none of that.\n \n \n   Isabel: It's a big risk.\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: Was she also undocumented?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yes.\n \n \n  "
