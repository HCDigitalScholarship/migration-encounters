  "text":"ita: What about sports? Were you a sports fan?\n      \n      \n Billy: Since I was nine years old, I was involved with sports. I was\n playing basketball and stuff. They put me in soccer, but I couldn't do it\n because people were kicking me in my shins [Anita laughs]. But horrible,\n man. My dad put me in this little Mexican team. It wasn't like the American\n soccer mom team. It was like a Mexican team and my fellow players they\n would kick me in the shin man [Makes kicking noises]. After two weeks I was\n like, \"Dad, I can't do this no more, please. Can't do it.\u201d [Anita laughs].\n      \n      \n Anita: So you started doing what? What did you do instead?\n      \n      \n Billy: After that I started skateboarding. I got a skateboard and I did\n that for 12 years of my life. Every day for 12 years of my life. And I\n actually took that somewhere so that was pretty cool.\n      \n      \n Anita: Were you a fan of sports teams?\n      \n      \n Billy: The Red Sox. I always like the Red Sox. Not because of\u2014\n      \n      \n Anita: The Red Sox?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah. And you know what? It has to do with the historicity of it.\n They were the first baseball team in the U.S. They have so much history.\n When you look at the old pictures, they have the big mustaches and the\n baseball bats. It just looks crazy and so I really like the history of it.\n And even just back in the '20s when they first started filming baseball and\n stuff. So, I just like the history of the Red Sox, but I don't watch it\n every Saturday.\n      \n      \n B"
