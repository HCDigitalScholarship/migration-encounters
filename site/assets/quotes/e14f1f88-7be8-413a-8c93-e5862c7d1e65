I don't have any\n   paperwork.\u201d Dude, you don't need a paperwork. There's a food stand that is\n   asking for a server or something. You just fill out an application and ask\n   them for a job. Explain the situation. You say you really need a job, and\n   you want to work, they're not going to reject you. They're not going to let\n   you in the streets. And that\u2019s the reason that they're asking for money\n   like that. Just get out. Get out of here. I'm not going to give you my\n   money. I'm giving you money to [inaudible 00:31:53] you can have a life,\n   you can have all type of programs. I'm sorry, I'm sorry. I might be a dick\n   right now.\n \n \n  "
