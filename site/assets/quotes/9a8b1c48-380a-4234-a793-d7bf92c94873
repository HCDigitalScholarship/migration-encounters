  "text":"Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she\n   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an\n   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was\n   like, \"It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.\n   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.\n   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me\n   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going\n   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.\n   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.\" I can show\n   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I\n   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].\n \n \n  "
