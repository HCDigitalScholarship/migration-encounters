  "text":"Ivan: I started talking more when I went to 12th grade. I started making\n   friends and a lot of people who like my own music and it was more so\n   Caucasians. So I would hang out with them and Mexicans even hate me more,\n   because I will hang out with the Caucasians and not with the Mexicans. But\n   interesting thing is by the time I graduated, it was 50% of Afro-Americans\n   and then 40% of Hispanics.\n \n"
