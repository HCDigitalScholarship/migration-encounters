  "text":"Weco: So, after four days after I got caught, they took me to jail. I\n   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the\n   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the\n   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was\n   there, she was like, \"You're my first young offender here in federal\n   court.\"\n \n \n  "
