  "text":"Sergio: When your family left, you said your mom separated from your dad?\n \n \n   Roberto: Mm-hmm (affirmative).\n \n \n   Sergio: Who else did your family leave behind?\n \n \n   Roberto: In Mexico, right? Well, my mom left behind like most of my family.\n   Most of my family is in here. Like my mom's grandma, a lot of my uncles,\n   that it will be uncles or aunts of my mom. How do you say? Well yeah, like\n   I mentioned most of the family she left here.\n \n \n   Sergio: Was it hard for her?\n \n \n   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And\n   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I\n   mentioned, I think it's difficult when you're in a different country where\n   you don't know nothing, not even the language, and it's difficult, and\n   trying to raise three kids.\n \n \n  "
