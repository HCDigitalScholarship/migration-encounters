It felt weird. I wasn't used to it. [Pause] I gave\n   that to the teacher. The teacher published it. My literature teacher was\n   extremely well known in the community. He's world renowned, I think,\n   because he is the host for the International Poets Meeting. He's the host,\n   so I'm pretty sure he's well known in the literature world, and he\n   published a lot of my poetry too because I had a lot of poetry\u2014and in\n   English.\n \n \n  "
