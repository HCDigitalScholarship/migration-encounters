  "text":"Axel: Finally, I gave up on that. I was like, I'll just take whatever plea\n they gave me. They gave me the two year plea. So I took it. I was like,\n okay. Two years again. I was like all right, here we go. But this time,\n it's actually jail. It's not county, it's not juvenile or anything like\n that. I thought it was going to be a lot worse than what it was, but like I\n said, it was the same. The only people that were different were really...\n The guys were bigger, but there was always mean guys in juvies too. The\n only difference that I really noticed were the guards. Since you were now\n older guys, you're adults, the guards were rough, they were mean, they were\n just abusive.\n      \n      \n Axel: Not abusive, really, because they never really hit you, because over\n there, they're more strict than here with that type of stuff, but they\n would talk really... They would talk down to you a lot and stuff like that.\n When I did my two years there, it was depressing for me. Every time, those\n two times that I did my time, I wasn't really depressed about me getting\n caught up, I wasn't depressed about my situation, I was more depressed\n about not being able to be with my family.\n      \n      \n"
