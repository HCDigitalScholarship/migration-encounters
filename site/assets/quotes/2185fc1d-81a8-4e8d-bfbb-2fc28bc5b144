  "text":"Luis: I kind of stopped.\n \n \n   Anne: Because of the scholarship?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. It was kind of like a heart-breaking moment for me. Because my\n   arts teacher had asked, \u201cDo you do envision yourself going to an art school\n   program or something?\u201d And I was like, \u201cYou know what, I never thought of\n   that and do I have what it takes!\u201d And, she was definitely pushing me\n   towards that route. But she didn't know my exact situation and I never told\n   her because I don't know, I just don't like people pitying me, you know? So\n   yeah, I kind of stopped and I started dancing after that\u2014just as a\n   hobby, nothing serious yet."
