  "text":"Anita: How did being undocumented affect your education?\n \n \n   Luisa: Being undocumented affected my education. The first time was when I\n   wanted to apply to Whitney Young\u2014when I wanted to go to a different high\n   school. I had the grades for it [Chuckles]. I've always had the grades for\n   it, but they were asking \u2026 I don't remember what kind of document they were\n   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, \"You know\n   what? Let\u2019s not. I don't want to. It's not worth it if I get deported. I\n   don't need to be\u2014it's not necessary.\" So I went to my local high school,\n   which \u2026 not the best high school, Washington High School, but they had the\n   IB program.\n \n \n   Anita: Why'd you want to go to\u2014\n \n \n   Luisa: Whitney Young? Because I've never felt challenged by any of my\n   teachers. All their curriculums I've laughed at. I run circles around my\n   teachers and most of them hated me because I'd finish my work and I'm\n   pretty sure they hated me. I remember this lady. What was her name? I don't\n   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated\n   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in\n   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, \"Ugh. What\n   am I supposed to do with you?\"\n \n \n   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is\n   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I\n   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.\n   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.\n   I think the problem with human beings is that you\u2019re your only true enemy.\n   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you\n   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,\n   sniffles].\n \n \n   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.\n   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid\n   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because\n   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't\n   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get\n   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].\n   Still not a challenge. It was still not a challenge.\n \n \n  "
