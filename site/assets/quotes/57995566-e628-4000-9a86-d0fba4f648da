  "text":"Anita: How'd you cross the border?\n \n \n   Ruben: We took a bus all the way to TJ (Tijuana), and we were there for\n   like two days and then they crossed us through Tijuana. Like a little\n   mountain. There was like a little mountain where you hike, go down and then\n   you come down to where they have a bunch of horses or whatever. What is\n   that thing called? Like a stable? where they have horses?\n \n \n   Anita: A corral?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah. Like they have like a bunch of them lined up. And I didn't\n   know there were horses. We were running, I was making noise and all of a\n   sudden they all started making noise at the same time, like telling the\n   owner, you know, there's somebody in here. We were hiking through a little\n   ranch.\n \n \n   Ruben: We hiked for at least five hours. My dad was carrying my sister and\n   I was grabbing onto my mom's hand. Once we landed after these horses, we\n   had to cross a freeway. This is at five in the morning or there's a lot of\n   traffic and I didn't want to cross it. I was scared. I said, no man, they\n   are going to run us over. But we finally crossed, came to a place near the\n   border. That's where they had us for like a day. After that they actually\n   transported us to Anaheim. In Anaheim, the people that had us there were\n   really nice but they still had two people with guns, in case you wanted to\n   run. We're there, they'll feed us and then that's when they start making\n   calls. We contacted my madrina (godmother) and she was like, \"I live in LA.\n   Tell him to bring you guys here.\" And they took us there. I remember they\n   were charging $750 a person. It was like $400 for kids at that time.\n \n \n  "
