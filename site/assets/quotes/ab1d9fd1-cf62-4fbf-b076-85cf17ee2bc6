  "text":"Anne: When you get back here and you're waiting around, did you go back to\n school? What did you do?\n      \n      \n Brenda: I wanted to. I remember being like, \u201cMaybe I could try school and I\n could see if I like it here. Then worst case, I get my papers, I do school\n here and I go back over there\u2014especially, economically it might've made\n more sense.\u201d My mom was always like, \u201cNo, three more months, next month.\u201d\n So, [Sigh] it went like that for a year and a half. When I came back, my\n brother, I would try to take him out as much as I could. He always chose\n American places like Chili\u2019s or whatever places. I was like, \"That's fine,\n but it costs a lot more money.\" So, money that my mom would send me that\n would last me months, in one outing with him, I would use it all because I\n wanted to make him happier, have him be calm. So, I was like, \"This isn't\n going to last.\" So, I was like, \"I need to get a job.\" That's when I\n started working.\n      \n      \n"
