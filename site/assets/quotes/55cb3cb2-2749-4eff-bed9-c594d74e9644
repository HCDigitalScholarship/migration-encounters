  "text":"Mike: And I had remembered he had already done that. He gave me a bag of\n   chips, and he just told me, \"Pay me back whenever you come.\" So I was like,\n   \"Dude, I can't do that again, because I don't have no money this time\"\n   [Emotional]. So I remember I prayed to God. I prayed to God. I was like,\n   \"Please God help me. I don't want to steal from this man. He's really good\n   guy.\" And, oh dude, this is crazy, because I look in my pocket\u2014I had the\n   chips in my hand and I was acting like I had money. Sure enough, I reached\n   in my pocket, and I had a dollar. A freaking dollar. I was like, \"God I\n   know you're real.\" Because at that time I was like, \"Yeah.\" But I got home,\n   opened the little bag, put some lime, put some hot sauce, feed my little\n   brothers and sisters.\n \n \n   Mike: Then I'm telling you, we were so hungry that I had some seeds, some\n   plants\u2014the garden seeds and stuff. I went outside thinking that they were\n   going to grow in a couple of days. I made myself a little garden, I was\n   planting them, and I was like, \"Please, God...\" When I was praying, I was\n   like, \"Please God, let me get this food so I can feed my brothers and\n   sisters, because I don't know when my dad is going to come.\u201d And right when\n   I look up, I see two officers. A lady and then a man. They said they were\n   US Marshalls or something like that. They took us.\n \n \n  "
