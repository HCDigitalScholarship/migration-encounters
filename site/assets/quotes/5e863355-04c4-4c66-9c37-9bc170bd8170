  "text":"Yes, it was very hard. In that time, I'm the biggest son of my dad,\n   and wouldn't have someone to interact with. Mostly it was my cousin. They\n   lived a few blocks away from us, so I just hanged out with them. Right now\n   I can remember they were teasing me for not knowing English. It's kind of\n   fun once you understand, right?\n \n \n  "
