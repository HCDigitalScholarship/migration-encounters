  "text":"Anne: What were your dreams when you were in the US? And what are your\n   dreams now? Have they changed?\n \n \n   Hugo: I wanted to be an architect and help my mom and my dad. Because my\n   dad works a lot. And he's always up to something. But, bad decisions, you\n   know? Like it feels good when you send them money from here, like from here\n   we send them money. Other people they would say all your kids, your family,\n   is the one that hits you hardest sometimes. My uncles and aunties they had\n   their kids doing good and everything, \"Oh look at your kids, they're pieces\n   of shit. They go to jail and they smoke, and this and that.\" And now that\n   we're helping them out from here, it's like, nobody says nothing.\n \n \n  "
