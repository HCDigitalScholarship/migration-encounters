  "text":"Many: Yeah, I love my family and I was too lonely. Well, I feel lonely in\n   Texas. I used to live with my uncle, but it's not the same. I miss my mom,\n   and my dad, and my brothers. So I helped them to cross the border because\n   we can live together again. So, we helped them because my uncle helped me\n   too. So we helped them to take them back to San Antonio, that's where all\n   my family right now it's in Texas.\n \n \n   Anne: Did they come visit you when you were in jail?\n \n \n   Many: No, because by that time, they don't have any official IDs or\n   something. So that's why they can't come and visit me. And my kids, they\n   can't let my kids visit me because they need somebody to take them, like\n   their mom. Her mom, she didn't want to.\n \n \n  "
