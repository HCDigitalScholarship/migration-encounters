His mom,\n   even though I was working and giving all my money to our home\u2026 So we used\n   to fight a lot because, even though I was working the whole day, I had to\n   come back home, cook, clean, and do everything that a Mexican wife should\n   do. Cook, clean, look after the kid, everything. They would say I would do\n   nothing. I was sick, and I had to do everything. They didn't work. They\n   didn't do clean. They wouldn't do anything. They would be attacking me all\n   the time. His parents, him against me. So I just let it happen. I was just\n   like, \"Oh.\" Just do what I have to do for my kid.\n \n \n  "
