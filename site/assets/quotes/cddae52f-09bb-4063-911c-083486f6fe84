What caused it?\n \n \n   Pablo: I was driving without a license.\n \n \n   Isabel: Driving without a license. And did they have any other record of\n   you because of your affiliation when you were younger with gangs, or...?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah, gang-related.\n \n \n   Isabel: Were you ever stopped by the police before that?\n \n \n   Pablo: No.\n \n \n   Isabel: So this was your first infraction or whatever you want to call it,\n   driving without a license. So were you taken in by the police? How were you\n   treated? What happened?\n \n \n   Pablo: I was taken in by the police and then the ICE officer would come\n   visit county jail every weekend. They would take care of all illegal\n   people, make you sign your deportation.\n \n \n   Isabel: So did they present you of your rights, or what happened?\n \n \n   Pablo: No, they just made me sign deportation. They didn't provide me with\n   any rights or anything. It was just like, \"You're going to sign this so you\n   can get deported.\" Because I had gotten arrested before. I was in county,\n   also. I was 17 by then.\n \n \n   Isabel: Why were you arrested that time?\n \n \n   Pablo: Because I had an issue with my girlfriend. Her mom, she actually\n   called the cops on me because we were fighting and stuff, so yeah they took\n   me to jail.\n \n \n   Isabel: They got like physical, then? Mom called the cops, and you were\n   taken to jail at 17?\n \n \n  "
