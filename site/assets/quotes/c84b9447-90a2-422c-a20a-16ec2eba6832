  "text":"Rocio: Well it was 1991. I wasn't working here and I had a friend that came\n   from Hawaii and asked me if I want to go for a vacation. And I said yes and\n   I arrived to Palm Springs. Beautiful place. I just love it. And immediately\n   he asked me if I want to get a job because across our apartment they were\n   asking for people who want to work in a hotel. And I went to apply and they\n   gave me the job.\n \n \n  "
