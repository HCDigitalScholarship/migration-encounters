I\n   got into like a backup, but it was for medicine. I wanted to be a surgeon\n   and because of the spaces we have to wait 15 days to see if anyone quits\n   and if it's the case and we still have time, then they get from the reserve\n   and they join, they complete the groups again, but I stay on the seventh\n   space,"
