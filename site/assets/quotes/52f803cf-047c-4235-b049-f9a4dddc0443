  "text":"I don't remember a lot of stuff, mostly because what hit me was\n   being separated from your dad. I can tell you that with my mom and my dad,\n   I have lived all my 20 years. I got to see my two brothers little. Right\n   now, they're older. Some point, that's why. Maybe I was distracted, or I\n   don't remember about things because I just cared about my family, about my\n   dad and my brothers.\n \n \n   Carlos: My cousins, for instance, I had a really good relationship with\n   them. Yeah, I think that's the most difficult part. But I had to pass at\n   that time, you know? I really appreciate my grandparents for taking care of\n   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're\n   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can\n   go places. I just go basically to sleep. I get Saturdays and Sundays off.\n   I'm barely at their house, but I really appreciate it, that they took care\n   of me.\n \n \n   Carlos: Most of the times, I think about what would be different from\n   living with my parents than my grandpa. You know, It's hard. It's hard.\n   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you\n   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not\n   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a\n   teenager. Right now that I\u2019m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't\n   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would\n   like, right?\n \n \n   Carlos: He does give me advice through the phone, but it's not the same you\n   know? He also send me money quite often, but I always say that the most\n   important thing is being with your actual family than all the economic\n   stuff or the money. Most important thing is the love and the relationship\n   you have with them.\n \n \n  "
