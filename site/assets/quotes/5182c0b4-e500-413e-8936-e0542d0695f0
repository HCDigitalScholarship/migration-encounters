  "text":"Sergio: You know that was different from a lot of other people in high\n   school probably too.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, it was a big difference for my friends and I, because they\n   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.\n   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, \"Hey man, why don't you\n   get your license?\" Only some of my very, very close friends\u2014probably like\n   two friends\u2014knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it\n   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to\n   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even\n   jealous, because I'm like, \"Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles\n   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your\n   position.\u201d\n \n \n  "
