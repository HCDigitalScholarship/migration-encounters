  "text":"Yair: Yeah. I actually had to finish high school, well, my last high\n   school, my last year of high school here because I didn't get to finish it\n   over there. It was really hard for me, because I felt like at the beginning\n   when I got over there in the United States, like I didn't know anything,\n   nothing. I barely spoke Spanish. It was kind of hard for me to understand\n   the math. All the subjects, the classes and stuff, it was really hard for\n   me to understand. I cut my grades. Actually, my certificate grade was for\n   7.9, which is really bad. It cost me a lot and all that. I barely made it.\n   I barely graduated. Then after I graduated I started working, started\n   finding jobs here, like call centers and stuff. Most of them, I have them,\n   most of them are a lot of customer service now.\n \n \n  "
