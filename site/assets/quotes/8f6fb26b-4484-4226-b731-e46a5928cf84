  "text":"Luisa: I do. I remember my dogs. I remember my mom. I remember my dad. I\n   remember my grandparents. I remember everything, and they didn't remember\n   anything. Their entire life was over there, so that's just my bitterness.\n   We moved back and I was so depressed. I don't think I've ever been that\n   depressed in my life. I had to go back to high school because \u2026 even with\n   the IB program. I killed myself. What was that worth, all that effort, and\n   all that [Chokes up]? What was it worth? Nothing. I had to go back to this\n   broken education system in Mexico which I could run laps around the fucking\n   curriculum and I had to redo it in order to go to university, and fuck,\n   that sucked.\n \n \n   Luisa: I was extremely depressed. I didn't even want to leave the house\n   because I didn't want to be reminded of the fact that I was not in the\n   States anymore, because it was ugly. It was ugly where we lived.\n \n \n  "
