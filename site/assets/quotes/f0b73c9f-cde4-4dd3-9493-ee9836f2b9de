  "text":"Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted\n   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do\n   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.\n   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my\n   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always\n   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you\n   barely get physical education, so imagine the change. [Chuckles]\n \n \n   Olimpya: [Laughs]. I was a happy kid. No, because even though we were a\n   small family, like my mom, my brothers, my aunt, uncle, cousins, and my\n   grandparents, we were very unite. We used to love to spend time with each\n   other. My aunt, she's like my angel. It's really fun because we were born\n   on the same day.\n \n \n  "
