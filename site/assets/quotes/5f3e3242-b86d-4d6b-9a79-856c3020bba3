  "text":"Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't\n   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, \"No,\n   that's not happening with us.\"\n \n \n   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?\n \n \n   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking\n   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my\n   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them\n   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate\n   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think\n   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon\n   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his\n   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back\n   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're\n   human beings.\n \n \n   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or\n   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me\n   leave the room. She was like, \"I can't see you right now. Leave the room.\n   You're so much like your dad. Leave.\" It really affected her. I get it.\n \n \n  "
