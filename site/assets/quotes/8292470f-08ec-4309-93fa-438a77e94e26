So yeah, I picked that up, started actually excelling in a\n   lot of classes, and that kind of was like the motivation to keep going\n   farther with my education.\n \n \n   Mike: I was doing really good. I was actually doing advanced classes, and\n   this was all from first grade onto middle school."
