  "text":"Roberto: For a while, not for a little bit, but I thought I was only going\n   to be for a while. But when I came here to Mexico, well, I realized that\n   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well\n   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over\n   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I\n   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in\n   US is only my grandma and like some of my uncles. And I have my whole\n   family here in Mexico.\n \n \n  "
