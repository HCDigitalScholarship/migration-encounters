I just want to have a\n   family like my aunt's family in the US.\" That's what I wanted. I started\n   working on that. I was really happy at that moment. I was pregnant. I was\n   going to have my kid. I had my husband. He loved me. Everything was\n   perfect, but then, this president with his political things came with the\n   reforma energetica.\n \n \n  "
