I want him\n   to go over there, too.\n \n \n   Anita: He gets racism because?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Because he was born over there.\n \n \n   Anita: But how do they know?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: In the school and by the teacher, by one teacher.\n \n \n   Anita: But how do they know? He doesn't speak a word of English.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I know but everybody around there knows him. They know who he is,\n   and they know me, too, and they're like, \"Well, he was born over there, but\n   he doesn't speak English. But he's born over there. \u201cEs el gringo.\" [he\u2019s\n   the gringo] I mean, that's how they tell him.\n \n \n   Anita: And what does he answer back? What do you answer?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: [to Roddy] Cuando te dicen el gringo en la escuela o el maestro\n   que te decia, que decias? [when they call you the gringo in school what do\n   you say?]\n \n \n   Roddy: [inaudible]\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Pero que le decias? Es la pregunta.

[laughs]\n \n \n   Anita: But what is he saying? What does he tell you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: On the beginning, he got upset because we talk about it. I was\n   like, \"You know what? If you want me, I will go and talk with that teacher\n   to stop the bullying,\" because he's pretty much that. But he getting to\n   swear me he doesn't care. He's like from here. He just, you know, nothing\n   changes. It\u2019s just like normal because he's been raised in here for almost\n   all his life.\n \n \n  "
