  "text":"Lizzy: And then you mention in the survey about, when we were talking about\n   whether you feel safe in Mexico, and you said that at least you don't have\n   the fear of the authorities that you have in the States.\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah. When I came I was so relieved. I'm like, \"Awesome. I'm\n   legal. I feel legal.\" That was nice, and then it's like, \"Now what?\"\n \n \n   Lizzy: But in that way, do you feel less afraid?\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah, I felt relieved, I felt free. And that was nice.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Had you ever felt free like that before in your life?\n \n \n   Yordani: Ever since I found out [I was undocumented], no, because I felt\n   like I'm always doing something wrong. I could just be here and [in US] I\n   feel like, I don't know, like I'm doing something wrong. And I didn't even\n   want to work, with pap-\n \n \n   Yordani: In order to work, you got to forage for papers and I didn't want\n   to do all that at first. I didn't want to do that, but it's like I guess I\n   have to.\n \n \n  "
