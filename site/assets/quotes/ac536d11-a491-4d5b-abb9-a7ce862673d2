She had a lot of health issues and then this\n   man who was her entire world just dumped her aside and she had to leave her\n   whole life behind and everything she knew, all the comforts and work. She\n   had never worked in her life [Chuckles]. I respect my mother a lot. She\n   started going to design school for designing clothes and it\u2019s pretty great.\n \n \n  "
