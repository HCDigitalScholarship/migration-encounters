  "text":"Anne: So how did that lead to your final deportation or voluntary\n   departure?\n \n \n   Mike: Remember I told you that I had lost my papers and that's when my son\n   was you know? I had lost my jobs and stuff. So it was really hard sometimes\n   to provide for my kids, because sometimes there wouldn't be people that\n   wanted tattoos, or there wouldn't be people that wanted a haircut.\n \n \n   Anne: That\u2019s what you did. You cut hair and\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. I had to. That's the only thing that I could do. And I\n   remembered to try to be good with the mother of my kids, I went after she\n   invited me to go with one of her friends because they had a hotel in a\n   resort casino. And I remember that I just wanted to please her. I wanted to\n   make her happy.\n \n \n   Mike: So again it's really hard to make someone happy when you can't\n   provide for them. So every little thing, I was just trying to be kind of a\n   kiss ass. And yeah, I went with her. I didn't like her friend. I hated her\n   friend. It's just one of her friends that always made her do bad stuff.\n \n \n   Mike: So I never liked hanging out with her, but I was like, \"I'm going to\n   try it, just because I'm trying to make her happy.\" And that's the day I\n   got caught up with the blunt in my ear and the security caught me. From\n   there on, I had to go to court fighting the cases and then basically I just\n   like\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: So you were detained?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. For like two days I believe for the blunt in my ear.\n \n \n   Anne: What is a blunt?\n \n \n   Mike: It's basically a wrap. A brown wrap that you put the marijuana in.\n   It's just like a cigar. Have you seen this Cuban cigar? That's what it is.\n   All they do is they cut it in the middle and they put weed inside. That's\n   what a blunt is.\n \n \n   Anne: How did they find it?\n \n \n   Mike: I had it in my ear when I was coming out of the\u2014there was a hotel and\n   the casino and in the middle they joined and in that middle part there is\n   security. So I was walking out going to the casino and they seen it in my\n   ear and they're like, \"What is that?\" And I was like, \"Aw damn, I'm done.\"\n   I knew it so I was like, \"Dude, I'm done.\"\n \n \n   Mike: They took me downstairs, checked me, and then they let me go. But\n   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next\n   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.\n   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I\n   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out\n   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going\n   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.\n \n \n   Mike: So they were like, \"Dude, you got to do something. You either going\n   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to\n   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do\n   a voluntary departure and you go.\" At that time I felt like I wasn't any\n   good to anybody. I didn\u2019t want to be a burden on my family.\" So I just\n   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran\n   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was\n   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I\n   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just\n   said, \"Screw it.\"\n \n \n   Anne: And the case that they were... I mean the criminal act was possession\n   of marijuana?\n \n \n   Mike: That was it. I still got the paper. I got all my voluntary departure,\n   everything.\n \n \n   Anne: How long until you came\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: I could go apply anytime I want, but just because of that, I feel\n   like that's going to have some issues. It's going to bring some issues up.\n   But they didn't say, \"Oh, you have to wait this long to do it.\" No, because\n   I did the voluntary departure.\n \n \n   Mike: I could've gone and fought the case and did all that stuff, but I was\n   like, \"No dude. Don't do it. Because if you lose, you're really not going\n   to be able to come back and then that's going to be something that your\n   kids are going to have to pay for.\" So I was like, \"Nah, man.\" I just left.\n   I'm just trying to do the right thing right now. Sometimes\u2014\n \n \n  "
