  "text":"I do. I do think that they should help them. I mean, even with the\n   simplest things like housing or provide shelters while they get on their\n   feet, while they're able to find something where they can work and have a\n   decent income. A lot of people here work for, like me, at my first job, I\n   was paid thirteen pesos an hour. So I worked for six hours every day for\n   thirteen pesos an hour. Now looking at it, it was like, why did you even\n   approach that job? It's completely not, it's dumb. But a lot of people,\n   even with my English, even with my knowledge, I worked for that income for\n   about a year. So probably the hardest part if we hadn't come back and had\n   somewhere to stay, would have been housing, somewhere to stay. I don't\n   know, probably an easier way to find a job, a decent job to get back on\n   your feet and be able to do something better for yourself because you're in\n   your home country. It should be easier for you, but it's not. It's really\n   not."
