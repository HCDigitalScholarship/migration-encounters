  "text":"Jose: Everything. The culture. I really like how there's a bunch of\n   different cultures. Whether or not everybody mingles together, there's so\n   many cultures for me to learn and see. Food. The freedom. The fact that you\n   don't really have to worry about the things you have to worry about here.\n   Here, you can't even be walking at night. You have to be looking around the\n   corner because you never know. There's probably like a 50% chance if you're\n   walking out a night, you're probably going to get robbed.

And here in Mexico, you got to really hustle really hard to even\n   survive. So that was the thing.\n \n \n  "
