  "text":"Yeah. It's being rejected from the States and from your home country\n   because even if you do have a high school degree here, they don't think\n   it's valid unless you go and have the institution here in Mexico validate\n   those studies. If you don't do that, it's like your paper's not worth\n   anything. So, it is on both sides. Getting rejected from the States and\n   getting rejected from your own country where you should have it a little\n   bit easier to find a job, to find housing, to find, I don't know, even a\n   decent meal. So, it should have the Mexico government thinking a lot more\n   on our own returning migrants."
