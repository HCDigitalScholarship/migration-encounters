  "text":"Then after high school, when I got pulled over, they brought me to county\n   and took me to prison. I said, \"Okay, so it's real. I am illegal.\" Then\n   after I fought my case and I came back out, that's when I really started to\n   say, \"Okay, yes, I am illegal. I am undocumented and I need to do something\n   about it.\" I guess back then the easiest way was to get married with\n   someone and they could fix you up. But I was 18 years old. I said, \"No, I'd\n   rather go back to Mexico.\" At the same time, I wanted to learn about my\n   culture.\n \n \n  "
