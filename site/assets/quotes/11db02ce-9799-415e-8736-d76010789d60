Even if you get into an accident or\n   they run you over, they'll go back and run you over until pretty much\n   you're dead just because they don't want to pay your hospitality in the\n   hospital. They don't want to pay it. They'll be like, \"Oh, she died. Might\n   as well pay that.\"\n \n \n  "
