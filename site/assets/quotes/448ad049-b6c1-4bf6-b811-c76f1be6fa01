  "text":"Anne: Were you living in that rural area before you left?\n \n \n   Juan: No, before I left, I was living here in Mexico City, but not in the\n   center. I was living in the outside of the center, where they were barely\n   making houses. In a way it is, as well, rural parts because the conditions\n   that we lived in weren't the best. We did have a roof over our heads and we\n   did have food, but things could have been better when I was younger.\n \n \n  "
