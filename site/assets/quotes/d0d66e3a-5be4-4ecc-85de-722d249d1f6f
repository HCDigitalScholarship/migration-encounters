  "text":"Axel: That day, I saw the lady get robbed for her wallet and her purse, and\n the guys ran into those areas. The police officers were around the corner,\n the lady ran to them, she told them, the police came. They're like, \"Who is\n it?\" They were looking at me. I was like, \"No, no. It wasn't me.\" I was\n like, \"It wasn't me, definitely not, but I saw it happen.\" I was like,\n \"Yeah, they ran up that way. Yeah, like she said, it was two guys, blah,\n blah, blah.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: Gave them all the information, they're like, \"Okay. Well, man, what\n we're going to suggest you do is go down to the court office, or the place\n where you make charges, and lift the charge pretty much about what\n happened.\" He's like, \"Because right now, if we go up there into that area,\n there could be more of them and they could also take our stuff, rob us or\n maybe even jump us or we could go up there right now and they're probably\n already gone inside a safe house or some friend's house. The chances of us\n getting your stuff back right now are literally zero to none. It's not\n worth the risk for us to go up there.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I'm like, huh. I was like, you're the police, you've got guns. What's\n the point of you getting guns and you being trained and everything if\n you're not going to go into the areas where the people are that are doing\n the bad stuff?\n      \n      \n"
