  "text":"When I finally really,\n   really understood what an immigrant was or why I was an immigrant, it was\n   the day that\u2014I was in a debate team in my middle school. We won, in the\n   whole district we won. We won the top prize. We went... Not national, I\n   think it was... Yeah, nationwide, we were supposed to go to DC.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: We were supposed to go to DC. I remember this then and it broke my\n   heart, so I want to even cry now [Emotional]. Damn. I asked my mom, \"Can I\n   go?\" She's like, \"No you can't.\" I'm like, \"Why?\" \"Because you can't fly.\"\n   I'm like, \"Why can't I fly?\" She said, \"Because you don't have a state ID,\n   you're not from here.\" I'm like, \"Damn.\" Then, I think she told the\n   school... She made something up, but that's when I finally knew it. Like,\n   \"Damn, this shit is real, this is real.\" Then after that I just, \"Okay,\n   whatever, I'm just gonna see where this takes us.\" Yeah, that's around the\n   time I found out.\n \n \n  "
