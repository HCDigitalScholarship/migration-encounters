And,\n   well, I used someone else's papers, so it wasn't really hard getting to the\n   US.\n \n \n   Anne: So you just got in a car and drove there?\n \n \n   Carolina: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: How long had you been separated from your mom?\n \n \n   Carolina: Five years, well, almost four.\n \n \n   Anne: Must have been hard to leave your grandma.\n \n \n   Carolina: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: She's probably what you thought of as your mother.\n \n \n   Carolina: She was.\n \n \n   Anne: And did your mom come to the US just to make a better life?\n \n \n   Carolina: Yeah, whenever I was little, I was really sick, so she didn't\n   have enough money to pay for all the medicine and all the equipment I had\n   to use. So that's why she left.\n \n \n  "
