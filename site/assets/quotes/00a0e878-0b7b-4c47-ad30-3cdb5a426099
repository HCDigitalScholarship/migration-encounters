  "text":"I mean a lot of them do join\n   gangs and do bad stuff, criminal behavior. But you didn't.\n \n \n   Luis: No, I didn't.\n \n \n   Anne: I didn't ever thought you would. But what do you think drives\n   those other kids to it and why not you?\n \n \n   Luis: I think that it was just a matter that my parents are really ignorant\n   in terms of education\u2014they didn't even finish elementary school\u2014but the one\n   thing that they did do well, is surround me and my siblings with books. I\n   think that's like a great thing that they did. Because sometimes I was just\n   bored of TV. And I will just go to the library\u2014well our own personal\n   library\u2014and I would just grab a book. We had a bunch of good books\u2026about\n   sci-fi. I remember The Time Machine by Wells. What other good books? We\n   have a lot of books, fantasy books, we had The Lord of the Rings. And I\n   would just grab the thing. And we had a lot of math books. For some reason.\n   I couldn't understand anything, but it was just fun looking at the\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: Comic books?\n \n \n   Luis: \u2014a lot of comic books as well. I'm a huge comic book nerd, so\n   yeah. We had a lot of those, and I would just, surround myself in knowledge and art and whatever. I do think that expands your knowledge or\n   like at least it gives you some sort of point of view, to realize that you\n   don't have to necessarily comply to whatever standard society is telling you. So, I\n   guess, at least for me, that was the difference with the people that\n   actually join gangs. Because I think that the people that join gangs,\n   that's a part of the environment\u2014not solely faulty on them, but on society,\n   because society is fostering those environments. So just, they want to feel\n   accepted, they want to feel like they have a family in my opinion. So yeah,\n   I think that was like the only difference. The only real difference.\n \n \n  "
