  "text":"Anne: In terms of you said you know you had dreams when you were in the US.\n   What about dreams now? What are your dreams now?\n \n \n   Miguel: I would love to go back. That's my main dream. Like going back, I\n   can focus on working, saving money. I know people out there and not\n   necessarily in big music industries or anything like that, but I know\n   people out there that could possibly help me better that part of music. I\n   like music, I like working on cars and everything that has to do with a\n   car, like the motor, paint, interior, stereo, anything. I like things like\n   that. So I feel like I have a greater opportunity in regards to education\n   out there for me to be able to accomplish that.\n \n \n   Miguel: I feel like I would have the tools that I would need, the resources\n   that I would need out there to become a better person and become a\n   successful person than out here. Out here is like you're limited. And if\n   you are better than someone, they try to pull you down from there. So it's\n   like \u201coh this guy's too good, let's not have him here.\u201d It's like jealousy\n   and things like that. Favoritism, a lot of favoritism goeson in places like\n   this. I try to get along with everybody, and there\u2019s a lot of people out\n   here like \u201cman he's a homosexual.\u201d Like so?\n \n \n  "
