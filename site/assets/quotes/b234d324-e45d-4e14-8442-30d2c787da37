  "text":"Laura: Then it got dark, and then it had started to rain. We were\n   walking\u2014we didn't know where we are. We were walking, and we have some...\n   Well it was like a little mountain, I don't know how to say that, but it\n   was like a little fold. We were walking, like in a little line. And we went\n   with our cousins. One of my cousin was going to fall down. Then we got to\n   the line, we were walking. It was raining, it was dark. The only light that\n   we can see was the moonlight. We didn't have any light at all. We were\n   walking, then when we got to the... We saw the road, but I don't know where\n   we, exactly. We just lay down. That rain was getting to us. My little\n   sister was shaking, because she was cold. We didn't have any jackets. My\n   dad was very scared because my sister didn't answer, my sister fell asleep.\n   And she was shaking a lot, but she never answer. We tried to wake her up,\n   and she never answer. We're like, \"Oh, my God, what happened to her?\" But\n   then she wake up, and she said she was fine, that she was cold only.\n \n \n   Laura: We were with many other people. Then we stay there, we fall asleep,\n   then somebody wakes us up and tell us to run to a truck. We run to a truck,\n   and there was two people that were driving, and he sit me on the back. He\n   lay my sister down and my dad was outside on the back of the truck. Well,\n   they drive all to, I think it was Arizona. Then we get to one home, they\n   just remove us the shoes. We didn't have any shoes on. We went to a little\n   room, and there was many other people that were already crossed there. The\n   only thing that we have, it was like a little bit, they gave us food to\n   eat. We have it. So, we stayed there for like twenty days because they\n   didn't know\u2014I mean, they didn't tell my other relatives, my family, how\n   much was going to be. So, we didn't have the money to take this, so we say\n   like twenty days there and there was people that have arms. We were\n   sleeping and there was somebody taking care of us, so we don't escape or, I\n   don't know, but they have arms, like huge arms.\n \n \n  "
