  "text":"iguel: The reason why I wasn't able to stay was because we went out to one\n   of my friends' birthday party. And it wasn't a big birthday party. It was\n   just like a dinner with his family at his house, zero alcohol. And after\n   that, we went outside and we did start drinking after a while. It got a\n   little bit late. And then we ended up having to leave, and during that time\n   my brother was with me and my brother, we went to 7-Eleven. And he ran into\n   some guys. And these guys start talking, asking my brother some questions.\n   And I wasn't sure what. So I got out the car and I was like, \"What's going\n   on?\" And the other guy is like, \"Where are you from? The gang banging\n   thing.\u201d And I looked at him like, \"Bro, what you want?\"\n \n \n   Miguel: I wasn't involved in gangs like that. But I wasn't scared of them.\n   And I was more of like a type of person that would like to have money. So I\n   was like, \"You don't you don't scare me with this,\" so one of them hits my\n   brother. And he hits my brother, I hit the other guy. And there was three\n   of them and two girls. So I started getting in a fight with one and the\n   third one comes out and hits me and knocks me down. That's when my friend\n   and my girlfriend, and at that time she was pregnant, she gets out. The\n   girl, the other girl gets out, my friend gets out and he starts fighting\n   with one of them. So I get up and I go to the car and I used to play pool.\n   So I had my pool stick with me. So I open up the case and I pull up the\n   stick. And when I see the guy going towards my brother again, I hit him\n   with the pool stick. So when I hit him, I knock him down.\n \n \n   Miguel: That's when pretty much everything started happening because\n   obviously blood started coming out of his head and people started getting\n   freaked out. So everybody starts yelling. I didn't leave because I was\n   like, \"Alright, well we're going to see what happens. Obviously, there's\n   cameras and they're going to see how everything happened, unfortunately, in\n   the cameras the only thing that you can see is me hitting the guy. So in\n   Oregon, they have this law called Measure 11, where it's a mandatory 16\n   months for any assault charge. And I was getting three assault charges for\n   each individual. And I had no self-defense rights or anything like that. We\n   explained\u2026 I had witnesses, letting them know what happened and they had\n   witnesses saying the other part. But the witnesses that were with them,\n   were pretty much saying that they confronted us when we got to the parking\n   lot in the car, they confronted us getting out of the car. And that's\n   exactly what happened.\n \n \n   Miguel: I think the judge noticed as well, that after so many court\n   hearings, these people didn't appear. They no longer went, but to one court\n   hearing. And if you see these people and you see me, you're going to be\n   like alright, \"What are they so scared of?\" These guys were covered in\n   tattoos. They were way older than me at that time. I mean I think one of\n   them was 35 and I was like 19. The judge is looking at him, he looked at\n   me, and I think that's what also made him change his mind because I was\n   going for at like least six years for an assault charge.\n \n \n   Miguel: And when he took all this into consideration, he saw them, and he\n   really pretty much said, \"Okay, well it doesn't seem like they're just\n   people out there not causing trouble, right?. They're looking for it.\" So I\n   think that's why he decided a year and a day. But then again, it was also\n   to send me to a state Prison, which that stays on your record, which did\n   affect me in my immigration status. If it would have been a misdemeanor, I\n   still could have been able to bail out in immigration, but with the felony,\n   I didn't have an opportunity, not even for voluntary departure, nothing\n   like that. That kinda made me more, it did stress me out a lot."
