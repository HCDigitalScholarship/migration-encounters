  "text":"I told my parents not to get close to the school. A lot of\n   students had to walk home far distances, scared of their parents going for\n   them because they stayed out there for a while and they were stopping cars\n   coming out of the school. They stopped the teachers, they stopped everybody\n   just because of the color of their skin. You got stopped and you got asked\n   for papers or ID, even though a lot of us knew it was illegal for them to\n   stay outside of a school and ask for papers.\n \n \n  "
