  "text":"What do you think it was like being away from your family, being in a\n new place? Just all of those things?\n      \n      \n Ana: I don't know. Here, I've met people who, immigrants. It's weird\n because in New York, I don't remember anyone, but here I've met a whole\n bunch of people and I think everyone has their own experience and I would\n compare it to, well, maybe not compare it. It's just, I feel that the fact\n that I didn't want to be here at first really affected the adapting into\n the culture because, essentially, Mexico, long-term again, has been\n wonderful. It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,\n if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of\n good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to\n acknowledge that I was in a place that I could enjoy being in. So the first\n year adapting was just harsh. The second year onward after knowing, \"You\n know what, if you're going to be here, you might as well do something with\n your life,\" I said."
