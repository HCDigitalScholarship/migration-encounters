  "text":"Yes. I was driving. I was coming back from work. I had the truck. I had my\n   father's truck. He had all the tools in the back, and I was just coming\n   back from work. There was a checkpoint. I got pulled over. I had a\n   permission that they give teenagers to drive. I remember giving that. Then\n   they were asking me more questions and then I started getting nervous for\n   some reason. Then they started questioning me, \"Hey, why are you so\n   nervous?\" \"You're here. I don't know what you're trying to do.\" Then they\n   took me into the, I don't know how to call it, separos, where they separate\n   you from\u2013 There\u2019s a glass window and they just put you in a room. They make\n   you take off your shoes. It's like a cell, like a big cell. I do remember\n   looking at people and they're like, \"Wow, man, these people really look\n   bad. I'm just 18 years old. I'm just a child.\"\n \n \n  "
