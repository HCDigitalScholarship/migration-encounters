  "text":"Yordani: Let's see... Well, I really feel like this was all my fault. I\n   hung out with the wrong crowd. I mean part of it was my status, but mostly\n   it was my life decisions, you know? I hung out with the wrong crowd. I\n   guess I didn't really have guidance. I ended up in a position where I\n   didn't like being there. I guess I found the solution was to leave.\n \n \n  "
