  "text":"Juan: Hopefully, once we get that going, we can get some houses here in the\n   city, in the center. Then that way I can manage that then pay off school\n   and work with that. My main goal is to be able to pay back \u2026 So my parents\n   can say that they're proud of me, that the help that they provided me, it\n   wasn't for nothing. Because how I see it is this thing could have gone both\n   ways. I could've come back to Mexico and then I could've been in depression\n   and started hanging out with the wrong people.\n \n \n   Juan: Not go to school, not get a job, just not care of what had happened.\n   But I decided to not go that route, to actually put an effort in my life,\n   to have the ambition to grow as a person individually, also as a career, to\n   grow. So, one day my parents can be like, \"We're proud of you and we've\n   always believed in you and the help that we provided you wasn't for\n   nothing.\" I have a lot of goals in life. Actually, dealing with\n   architecture.\n \n \n   Juan: My plan is I want to have enough money so I can build houses out of\n   plastic\u2014not in the center because it's already big enough. I want to build\n   houses out of plastic in the outside of the city, in Ixtapaluca,\n   Chignahuapan, the outside parts of the city where it's really rural, really\n   rough sizes, and help back to the community, be able to provide with houses\n   that they are able to afford, but there are also houses that are \u2026 How do I\n   say it? Houses that are \u2026 I had the word.\n \n \n   Anne: Environmentally sound, maybe? Good for the environment?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. Good for the environment. Yes, to have a decent home. Because\n   not a lot of people here have that. Supposedly the law here says that every\n   Mexican citizen has the right to have a decent house and obviously they\n   don't follow that. I want to be able to provide that to the community.\n  "
