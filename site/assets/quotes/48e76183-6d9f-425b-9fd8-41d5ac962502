  "text":"I was doing a lot of\n   extra stuff, but once I started getting into high school, I noticed all my\n   friends getting jobs and having new shoes and this and that. And I would\n   ask him like, \"What are you doing?\" And he was like, \"I just got a job. I\n   got a car. I got this.\"\n \n \n   Mike: I could see them--that they were advancing in life, and I was still\n   in the same spot. So I asked my mom if I could get a job, and that's when\n   she broke it down to me that I wasn't even from here. And that was right\n   there like a slap in the face.\n \n \n  "
