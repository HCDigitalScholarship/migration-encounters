  "text":"Laura: Guns. I mean, I was very afraid because of my sister. She was a\n   little girl. My dad was afraid as well. He just wanted to take us out of\n   there, but we have to wait like the twenty days. When we go to the bathroom\n   when we need, my dad took us to the bathroom. To eat, they only give us one\n   egg, and just a little piece of bread in the whole day. It was pretty much\n   the worst. And then, when my family takes us out, that person that would\n   take us out to another person, that person sit me in the front of the car.\n   And that person has a gun right beside me. I was pretty scared about it,\n   because I thought they were going to kill us or something. Once they took\n   us to the other person\u2014the other person was pretty nice\u2014he took us to his\n   house. He told us to take shower, to grab the food that we want. So, that\n   person was very nice with us. He give us food, we took a shower, and then\n   he took us to California where we supposed to be. So that person was pretty\n   nice. Then we got there, and we started to go to school.\n \n \n  "
