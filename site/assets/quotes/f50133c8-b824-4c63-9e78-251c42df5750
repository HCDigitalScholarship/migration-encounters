  "text":"So, when I was five years old, they asked me if I\n   wanted to go with my grandma, with my mama, or my papa. So I just had to\n   choose between them. And my grandpa was not amused by that. He didn't like\n   it, so he said, \"Why don't you come with me?\" He gave me that option, to a\n   kid. \"Do you want to come with me? I travel a lot and I like going to a lot\n   of places.\" So, he said, \"Yeah, do you want to come with me?\" And I was\n   like, \"Yeah, of course!\" I didn't know what the hell I was getting into to\n   be honest. So, I arrived into ___, Utah when I was five years old, and from\n   there, I just started to learn a little language, to hang out with\n   different kinds of kids, to live without my mama or my dad or my brother of\n   course. And I think that was the best part, to try to experience something\n   new. Something new from the beginning.\n \n \n  "
