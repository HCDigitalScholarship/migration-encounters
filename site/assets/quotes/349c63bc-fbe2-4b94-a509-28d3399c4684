  "text":"Sergio: Since you've been back have you pursued any studies?\n \n \n   Josue: No, not that either. \u2018Cause I think that it's iffy, like whenever\n   you want to use your diploma from the States, they don't just say, \u201cOkay\n   you did that and so you can now go on to college or whatever.\u201d I don't\n   think it's like that. You have to do something.\n \n \n   Sergio: Has that been hard for you with your culinary background?\n \n \n   Josue: I mean I wouldn't want to study that. I would actually want to study\n   something that I can use here, like business or something, something where\n   I can grow. But like I said, from what I've heard\u2014I don't know too much\u2014you\n   do have to do something so that they can validate what you did in the\n   States down here. But I don't know enough about it. That's it.\n \n \n   Sergio: So that's too much for you, you don't want to go through that whole\n   process?\n \n \n   Josue: I would, but I think it's also pricey. Like I said, I just don't\n   know enough about it to do it. But I know that you need money.\n \n \n  "
