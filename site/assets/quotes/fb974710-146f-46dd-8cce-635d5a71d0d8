  "text":"Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a\n younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had\n anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you\n know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for\n some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising\n my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my\n family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad\n was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the\n moment.\n      \n      \n Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was\n always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. \"Look, the day that\n I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise\n my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues\n going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm\n paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still\n AB type student.\" But I don't know.\n      \n      \n Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,\n that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger\n just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was\n a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me\n probation for two years."
