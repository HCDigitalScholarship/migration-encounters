My mom was really strict, but\n   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would\n   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? \"Hey,\n   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,\" and that will be a\n   group of gang members.\n \n \n  "
