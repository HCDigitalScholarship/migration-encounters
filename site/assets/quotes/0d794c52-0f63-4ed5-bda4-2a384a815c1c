  "text":"Rodolfo: Yeah, it was a big difference for my friends and I, because they\n   all got their license, they all were able to get their ID and everything.\n   And I wasn't able to do it. Then when I was asked, \"Hey man, why don't you\n   get your license?\" Only some of my very, very close friends\u2014probably like\n   two friends\u2014knew that I wasn't documented. Then, when we spoke about it\n   amongst other friends, they knew that it was like another secret you had to\n   keep. Yeah, it was different with other kid. Sometimes I'll be even\n   jealous, because I'm like, \"Damn, if only I had been born a couple of miles\n   North of the border, or West of the border, or whatever, I could be in your\n   position.\u201d\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I'm like, \"Why, why do I have to feel that way man? I'm a good\n   person. I've made mistakes and things like that but hey man...\u201d Nah, don't\n   think that way you know? Just because you don't have a visa that says\n   you're from America, doesn\u2019t mean you can't do the same things. What, at 15\n   I bought my first car by myself. At 16, I got my first ticket, my first\n   pull over. But why? Because I was coming home from work. That's when I was\n   already working at Chili's\u2014I was working in Schofield, Illinois at Chili's.\n   You know restaurant jobs, you got to work late. At that time in the\n   suburbs, there's not much transportation short of a cab ride. But I'm not\n   gonna be wasting money every day, so that's why I bought my car.\n \n \n  "
