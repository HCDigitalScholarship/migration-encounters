  "text":"But yeah, that's what happened. 11 months,\n   almost a year, I tried to go back, went to county. Well they give you state\n   time, they give you state prison time, but since the prisons are packed,\n   you do it in county, which is a little bit worse.\n \n \n   Anne: Oh, it's worse?\n \n \n   Hugo: Nobody wants to be in the county. Because you're sleeping next to a\n   guy that doesn't know how much time he's going to do. So, it's not like\n   you're scared, but there's kids that are crying because they are doing 2, 3\n   years when the guy above you is facing 80 years to life. You better shut\n   your mouth. You're going to get something.\n \n \n  "
