  "text":"Was there any\n   domestic abuse in your family?\n \n \n   Luisa: With my parents? My mother, yes. She doesn't like to talk about it.\n   The older I get, the more she opens up, but it's not something that she\n   likes to talk about. It was never in front of us, it was behind closed\n   doors. I thank my father. He's a piece of shit, but I thank him for at\n   least having the thought of not wanting to traumatize us. So yes, it was\n   behind closed doors, but the more I get out of my mom, it was a lot of\n   emotional abuse as well, a lot. I think there was some physical abuse. My\n   mom's never touched upon it, but that's what happened."
