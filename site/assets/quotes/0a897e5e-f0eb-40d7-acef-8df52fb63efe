  "text":"Ivan: Be more open minded. I mean, we're in 2019, that kind of thinking\n   like, oh, we're just a race, we don't accept you because you have a\n   different skin tone. I don't think that kind of thinking fits in anymore\n   because we're a society, we keep evolving as humans because we've been\n   evolving since we were first here in the Earth. And it's not just\n   physically, it is intellectual. Your mind just keeps growing and keeps\n   growing, keeps growing, keeps growing nonstop. And I think welcoming people\n   from another ethnic groups is part of evolution. It's going to happen one\n   day. Especially the government now is trying to stop it, but that is going\n   to happen someday. And I would say what the United States as a country\n   needs to do is embrace the evolution. Yeah.\n \n"
