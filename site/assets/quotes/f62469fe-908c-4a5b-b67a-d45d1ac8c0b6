  "text":"Also, one of the things\n   that I remember strongly about high school\u2014my first experience in high\n   school\u2014is that in Mexico, usually rules are kind of rigid in the sense that\n   if you're late, you need to knock on the door and ask for permission to\n   enter the room. So, I did exactly that when I was over there in my first day of high school. I\n   wasn't confident in my English so it was like really difficult for me and I\n   did it. And everybody's like, what the hell is this guy doing? I was like,\n   sorry for being, courteous, I was just trying to not be a douche. Okay. But\n   then I understood that and then rallies, rallies were like really\n   interesting because it's like what are we doing in the gym, school spirit\n   or what do you mean? It was really weird and kids were, kids are bullies.\n   Most of them even if they're bullied, they want to bully somebody else for\n   some reason.\n \n \n   Anne: Do they bully you?\n \n \n   Luis: No, well sometimes but not really because I was big, I remember that on my\n   first rally I was just sitting on top of the bleachers and this small kid just\n   started grabbing my thigh, right? Doing weird stuff to it. And I told him,\n   \"You need to stop please. You need to stop.\u201d He wouldn't stop. So I just\n   hit him like this [makes a gesture with his arms] and with the elbow and I just ran away to the bathroom\n   because I thought I was going to get expelled. So that was, that was\n   interesting I guess."
