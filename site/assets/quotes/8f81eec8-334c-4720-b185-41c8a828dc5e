  "text":"Jeimmy: My parents were afraid. They would stay at a specific job. Usually,\n   at first, they started off working in like el campo, which is like land\n   fields. So it was like picking up apples and peaches, cherries. But\n   Immigration would be there often. So you would just see like people scream,\n   \"la migra.\" And everybody would like run.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, they started looking for other things that weren't as dangerous\n   as that. So we moved to a different state where mostly the jobs there were\n   like fabricas.[factories] They stayed there, but then you would notice that\n   la migra tambi\u00e9n llegaba a las f\u00e1bricas, [immigration authorities also went\n   to factories] So, they started migrating very often. Basically, just\n   keeping a down low on that and not trying to like be caught by La Migra.\n \n \n  "
