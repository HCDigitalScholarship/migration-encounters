  "text":"Sergio: Did you ever work in the US?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah, I worked all the time, I never stopped. One of the first\n   jobs I had\u2026My uncle worked at a restaurant called, Baker's Square in\n   Chicago. It was on the corner of Tui and Pratt. I really, really, really\n   wanted\u2014I think I was in fifth or sixth grade\u2014a phone. I wanted a phone,\n   it\u2019s called the Psychic Slide. Phones used to flip, but this one slides. I\n   wasn't gonna ask my mom for it, so I asked my uncle. \"Hey man, I know you\n   work at Baker's Square and I know around the holiday season it gets really\n   busy. Can I help you? Can I go?\" He's like, \"Well, yeah, if you want.\" I\n   used to wake up like 3:00 in the morning, and I used to go and help him\n   out. After that, I really liked making money and I really liked dressing\n   nice, I liked having my nice haircut or whatever. My very, very first job\n   was in Wilmette, Illinois. I was a caddie. Yeah, and then\u2014\n \n \n   Sergio: On the golf course?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: On the golf course, yeah. Wilmette Golf Course actually. I\n   remember I was always the first one there. They used to choose us, when\n   everybody got there, \"Okay, you come with me, you come with me.\" I used to\n   always go there and there was a gentleman by the name of... Man, I forgot\n   his name. Like the President, Gerald Ford, that was his name Gerald Ford!\n   The only reason I remembered was because of the President. He used to\n   always get there around the same time I got there. He finally asked me, \"Do\n   you want to be my personal caddie? I don't want you working anymore with\n   all these other kids, because nobody wants to work. Do you want to be my\n   personal caddie?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, absolutely.\" It was going really, really\n   well and everything.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I got to high school, I had a number of jobs. I worked at Subway,\n   I worked at Chili's, I worked at... What was it? Outback Steak House, but\n   then I finally just got to the Cheesecake Factory, and that's where I\n   stayed the remainder of my time. The remainder of my time I stayed there,\n   and I started from the busboy and I finally ended up being a bartender. One\n   of the head bartenders, one of the head servers, they used to pay-out\n   people and everything. Obviously, I didn't have my social or anything, but\n   I was a little bit older than what I really was. When I first got there,\n   when I first, first started working I think I was like 14. Obviously you\n   can't work that young, I think actually, I was 18, at 14.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I didn't see it as anything bad. I knew that if I got caught with\n   my fake ID and my fake social security card I'd get in trouble, but that's\n   why we're there, that's why we worked. I didn't get a fake ID to go party\n   or go get into clubs or bars or anything. The main purpose of it was for me\n   to be able to get a job, and so my mom wouldn't have to work all those\n   hours that she used to work. She used to work at a Burger King, overnight.\n   I used to barely see her, and I didn't want that anymore. I told her, \"You\n   don't have to work that much if I start working. We can help each other\n   out, we can, we're a team.\u201d It was only my mother and I until I turned 14,\n   when she met my stepdad. All throughout that, it was just my mother and I.\n \n \n  "
