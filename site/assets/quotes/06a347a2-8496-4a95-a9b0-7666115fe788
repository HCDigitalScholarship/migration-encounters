  "text":"Dan: Well, at the beginning I remember there was a lot of ... Well, now\n   it's called bullying. Back then, it was just making fun of. ... because I\n   didn't know how to speak English well. I didn't know how to communicate. I\n   didn't know how to make myself understood. It was just a lot of language\n   barrier, I would say.\n \n \n   Isabel: Was the school helpful with language, or did you have to learn it\n   on your own?\n \n \n   Dan: Well, high school that's when I got ESL, which was English as a Second\n   Language. And I remember teachers tried to help. That's when I got the\n   help. But before then, it was just hardly.\n \n \n   Isabel: So they didn't have any ESL for elementary or middle school?\n \n \n   Dan: No.\n \n \n   Isabel: Wow. How did you pick up English, then?\n \n \n   Dan: Well, just hanging out with my classmates. And my sister was with me\n   and my cousin, so we would make our own little group and we would hang out\n   with all the Hispanic guys and then we'd encourage each other to just start\n   talking English. We had to start somehow.\n \n \n   Isabel: And when you said there was bullying because of the language\n   barrier, was that why you formed those groups with people who also spoke\n   Spanish?\n \n \n   Dan: Well, yeah. You feel more comfortable with Hispanic people. They try\n   not to make fun of you because they know how it feels. They've being in\n   that situation before. We try to help each other and just stick together.\n \n \n  "
