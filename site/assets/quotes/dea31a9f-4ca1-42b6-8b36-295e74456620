  "text":"So, we were living over there and the conditions were really\n   poorish. There was some kind of domestic violence ingoing on with my parents. \n   They were having a lot of issues. So, one of my uncles invited us\u2026 \u201cYou can \n   always come and live with me.\u201d And my mom just got fed up of this whole situation\n   with my dad and so just one night took us all and [Snaps finger] we\n   disappeared.\n \n \n   Anne: Without your dad?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. It was interesting. We went to Tijuana, we stayed with some\n   dude, I'm guessing he was a coyote or something like that. And then, he\n   gave us like the shittiest IDs to cross and we did. My mom was super\n   nervous at the time, but since I was 12, 13, I don't remember. I didn't\n   know the scope of the seriousness of what we were doing. So, me and my\n   little brother, we were like, \u201cAh, it's like whatever.\u201d So yeah, I think\n   that sold it pretty well to the guy that was checking the IDs. So yeah, we\n   crossed. And the funny thing is that we were on a shuttle to ____,\n   that's the name of the town. And we were driving in this freeway and\n   everybody\u2019s just sitting there really serious, really quiet. And then we\n   passed a couple immigration officers, and they actually stopped another\n   shuttle. So, we passed them by, and I could just hear like [Sigh of relief]\n   and everybody was cheering and stuff and like \u201cWow.\u201d So it was a funny\n   moment. It was surreal, like \u201cWhat is going on?\u201d, \u201cIs everybody\n   an inmigrant like me?\u201d It was crazy [Laughing].\n \n \n  "
