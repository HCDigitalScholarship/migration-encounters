  "text":"Frank: Actually, no. Why? because I was raised in a different mind. I can\n   say that no matter if they're racist, I don't have any reason to try to\n   treat people wrong. And basically taking that on my mind that's why I\n   decided to make an extra mile for me, for my life, and I decided to start\n   with customer service. We know that most Americans, they don't like to deal\n   with same American people, that's why they started doing outsourcing. I\n   know that I can make a difference with a lot of people. They have a\n   straight mind[set] saying that I don\u2019t want to talk to a Mexican and I\n   don't want to talk to a different people.\n \n \n  "
