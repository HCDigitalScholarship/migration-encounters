  "text":"Olimpya: Then they said, \"Okay. You need to study. You're going back to\n   school.\" I was like, \"Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?\"\n   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, \"Mom, you're not going\n   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to\n   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.\" It was a\n   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that\n   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't\n   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to\n   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like\n   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they\n   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, \"You\n   don't come from the States.\" Like, \"Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I\n   do come from the States. I basically come from there.\" Like, \"No, you\n   don't. You're just a Oaxaque\u00f1a.\" Start calling me names again, \"You're\n   brown. You're short. You're skinny.\"\n \n \n  "
