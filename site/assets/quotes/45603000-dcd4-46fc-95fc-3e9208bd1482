  "text":"Juan: I still remember in high school, my high school friends\u2014I was in the\n   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but\n   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries\n   from Latin America, who \u2026 My friends who were white, they were all nice to\n   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their\n   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.\n \n \n   Juan: They would tell them, \"Go back to your country,\u201d or \u201cYou can't even\n   speak English right.\" Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't\n   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that\n   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really\n   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my\n   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people\n   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.\n \n \n  "
