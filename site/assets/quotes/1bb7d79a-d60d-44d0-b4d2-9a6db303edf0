  "text":"Anne: Was it hard leaving your family behind?\n \n \n   Many: Yeah. I wish I can take my mom, I wish I can take my brothers with\n   me, but I think that I had to do this by myself first in order to help\n   them. I had to go first to get money in order to bring them with me. It was\n   harder because my sister, she was just like four years old. My brothers,\n   was like seven and eight years old. So it was really hard to tell them bye.\n   It was hard.\n \n \n  "
