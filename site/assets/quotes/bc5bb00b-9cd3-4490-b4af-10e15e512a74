I\n     already knew how to do those in my head. \"You already knew?\" \"Yes. That's\n     what I learned here in Mexico.\"\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Was he surprised that a Mexican knew that?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Yes, very surprised.

No, I don't\n     know what it is.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     But you learned.\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I learned, yes.
