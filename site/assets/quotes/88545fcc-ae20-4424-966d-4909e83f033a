But no, still, there's still some things that I have to learn\n or that somebody shows me and I'm just like, \"Oh, all right.\" I've met some\n people that are actually from here and they've learned English here, in the\n school, and they're actually pretty good at it and they told me about their\n life here and they're the ones that show me around or explain to me some\n type of legal stuff or not legal stuff or maybe how stuff works around\n here. I still learn a lot of stuff.\n      \n      \n"
