  "text":"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really\n making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I\n guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just\n going into those in more detail.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,\n 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It\n was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?\n      \n      \n Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in\n the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was\n that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we\n weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a\n breather, she's, \"No, we got to talk because we have to talk.\" And so that\n day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,\n she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I\n saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Swooped up the baby?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the\n floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of\n stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off\n with my kids\u2014I love my kids to death.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into\n elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,\n because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going\n to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from\n school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have\n problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're\n going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck\n together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we\n didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we\n loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to\n take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I\n called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put\n her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we\n were literally tugging at the car seat.\n      \n      \n Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in\n a car seat. I told my little brothers, \"You know what, I need you to sit\n down and help me.\" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want\n anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need\n you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two\n brothers. I told one, \u201cSit down and see what's going on.\u201d And I told the\n other one, \u201cI need you to call the police.\u201d I called the police and they\n told me, \u201cIt's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts\n your hands on each other, then you can call us.\u201d\n      \n      \n Isabel: How old were you?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never\n came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out\n of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I\n had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two\n daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the\n toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the\n back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told\n them, \u201cYou know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off\n with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't\n want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's\n crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,\n something's going to happen.\u201d They never showed up. I promise you if they\n would've showed up then, anyways\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: No, I\u201a\n      \n      \n Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I\n called them, everything probably would have been\u2026I probably wouldn't have\n ended up deported. So, she left with the kid\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, \"Take my kids, go watch\n TV and just keep them entertained.\" So my wife took off, me and my kids\n spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around\n seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I\n was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid\n attention to my little baby and she said, \"She has a bruise.\" And I asked\n her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, \u201cIt's on her\n ear.\u201d And right away I started putting things together and I said, \"My\n little baby got hurt, something happened.\" I didn\u2019t tell my mom at the time\n what had happened, and then I told her, \"What do I do?\" And she said,\n \"Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.\"\n We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers\n were on me. They asked me, \"Where's the mother?\" And I told her, \"Well, the\n mother's not here.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: \"Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this\n is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the\n hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because\n we have people that are waiting for you.\" As soon as I got to the hospital,\n I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running\n around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little\n city that I was staying\u2014it was a very little city and very, very, very\n little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already\n gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,\n there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control\n the situation or calm it down.\n      \n      \n Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my\n side of the story. She said, \"The little baby got hurt, I have four\n children, I'm going to put you behind bars.\" My wife got there, they asked\n her what happened and she said, \"It was his fault.\" This was around 1:00 AM\n in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout\n the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to\n lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she\n didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to\n take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they\n said, \"You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the\n hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for\n your arrest.\" And I told them, \"Okay, well hold on. What's going on?\" And\n they said, \"We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little\n baby.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: I told him, \"No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little\n baby.\" And they said, \"Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give\n you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to\n go ahead and read you your rights.\" I didn't know what's going on, with\n them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally\n scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and\n they told the police officer, \"No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't\n have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them\n a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.\"\n So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next\n morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout\n the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already\n went to my house and picked up my other children.\n      \n      \n Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,\n I called the police station and I told him, \"You know what? I need to know\n whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's\n going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I\n don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,\n I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something.\" And they\n told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month\n waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she\n told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, \"Okay, well\n what's next?\" And she said, \"I don't know son.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: I told her, \"Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to\n see what's going on.\" The next morning, I was on my way to the police\n station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I\n was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was\n walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they\n hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see\n me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my\n mom, \"Where's he at?\" And she said, \"He's walking to the police station as\n we speak.\" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.\n They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,\n and literally they greeted me with, \"Mr ____, how are you doing?\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on\n their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police\n station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the\n neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, \"Really? I'm literally\n in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?\" And I was just the\n biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me\n that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out\n that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't\n sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the\n hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.\n      \n      \n Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their\n police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense\n whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the\n detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, \"Who did\n this?\" And I told her, \"You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works\n for the state. My mom has her own daycare.\" Me and my mom went to the\n clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to\n think, \"Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the\n baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my\n baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that\n you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type\n of guilt.\" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to\n the hospital because he feels guilty.\n      \n      \n Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,\n there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I\n presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I\n was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years\n or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25\n years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all\n until my lawyer said, \"This is where we're at. You want to protect your\n wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,\n you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.\u201d She literally took out\n her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,\n and then\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Where are the kids?\n      \n      \n Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, \"Let's go to\n trial, I'm going to fight this.\" The next day the state called me, and they\n said, \u201cWe're going to offer you three years.\u201d And I told my lawyer, \"Okay.\n So what's going to happen?\" She said, \"You've already done nine months.\n You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go.\" And I\n said, \"Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,\n I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever\n she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that.\" So I said, \"Okay,\n I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an\n immigration bond, so I should be good to go.\" As soon as I got to prison,\n immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road\n ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.\n But I ended up being deported.\n      \n      \n Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound\n exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, \u201cIf I'm here and I'm\n carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?\u201d Like\n there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not\n being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US\n authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're\n undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and\n paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that\n they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in\n these situations.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Exactly.\n      \n      \n Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the\n altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and\n she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, \"Please don't,\n you're not leaving with my children.\" Like, when you said you're in a toxic\n relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?\n      \n      \n Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where\n she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical\n because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she\n literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There\n was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the\n door go and out of nowhere I just see lights\u2014I see lights. Yeah, she hit\n me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I\n grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my\n dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget\n that.\n      \n      \n Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm\n never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, \"Okay,\n that's going to make you feel better, go ahead.\" So at first, she started\n slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon\n as she punched me in my eye, I was like, \"Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps\n anymore, you're out of control.\" I held her, she was facing the wall, she\n bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go\n and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her\n lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting\n up blood because at that point she told me, \u201cGet out of the house.\u201d\n      \n      \n Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,\n \u201cThis is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go\n to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.\u201d So she\n picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the\n phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.\n I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them\n down and I told them, \"Hey, you know what, this is what happened.\" They\n took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of\n the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only\n point it ever got to a physical altercation.\n      \n      \n"
