  "text":"Ivan: So I was amazed like, how could this country be like this? Because it\n   was so different from what I was used to. I was so surprised I had a bus\n   taking me to school. I was like, what, this is so cool. I was impressed by\n   that. And having a good meal at school, that was surprising as well. I was\n   like, what, I'm getting burgers every single day. That was pretty nice as\n   well.\n \n"
