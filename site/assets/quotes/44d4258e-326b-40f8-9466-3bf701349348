  "text":"my mom at the time, we did not know she had a tumor in\n   the back of her brain. Right where her brain stem is, she had a huge tumor\n   there and we had no idea. Nobody knew. She doesn't remember a lot of this.\n   I don't know if it's because of the emotional trauma or because of the\n   tumor, but once we got to Chicago, it was evident that something was wrong\n   with my mother and she started going to the doctor.\n \n \n  "
