  "text":"Many: Well, a year and half. I lost everything pretty much. I lost\n   everything. I lived there for almost fourteen, fifteen years, and I had to\n   start all over again in Mexico. This is hard because when I left from here,\n   I was fifteen. When I came back, I was thirty-one. So, everything was\n   different for me\u2014it was like you start a new life. It was the same thing\n   when I went to United States when I was fifteen. So when I came here,\n   everything was very difficult for me to get a job because I don't have any\n   papers, I don't have any friends. I don't have family.\n \n \n   Anne: Your family had left?\n \n \n   Many: Yeah, because all the family was in Texas. So, when I came here, I\n   went to the place where we used to live because I know a few guys from\n   my\u2014let's call it from my neighborhood. So, I just know a few guys. They\n   helped me a lot. It was difficult. It's still difficult to live here\n   without a family because sometimes I saw a lot of people with, especially\n   around here, guys with kids walking around the park and everything. I wish\n   I can go back in time and take my kids to a park or somewhere. But I can't,\n   I had to get used to it.\n \n \n  "
