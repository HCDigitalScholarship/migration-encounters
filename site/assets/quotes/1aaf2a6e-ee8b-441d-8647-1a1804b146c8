  "text":"Carolina: There was one teacher who didn't like me. I don't know if it was\n   because of my race or something, because with everybody else she was really\n   cool. If they didn't have their work done, she would just pass them. And if\n   I didn't do my work right, she would put a bad grade on my work and she\n   wouldn't tell me why. Or I would do my homework and they wouldn't, and yet\n   I would still have a bad grade.\n \n \n  "
