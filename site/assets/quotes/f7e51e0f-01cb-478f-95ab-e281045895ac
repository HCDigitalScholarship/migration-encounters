When I see people, as long as I\u2019m by myself, and I see people\n   getting close to me, I'm going to get just on guard. I see something you're\n   trying to do to me, I'm just going to scream and run. [Chuckle]. I don't\n   feel safe. I\u2019m always aware.

When I get\n   out and get into the bus, I have to check my wallet. I get out, I check my\n   wallet and everything.
