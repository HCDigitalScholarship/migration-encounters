  "text":"Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three\n   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping\n   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to\n   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or\n   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp\n   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the\n   English.\n \n \n  "
