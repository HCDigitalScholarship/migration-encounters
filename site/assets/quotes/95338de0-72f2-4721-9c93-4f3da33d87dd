  "text":"Ivan: Yeah. So different, the school system, the education system is so\n   different. At least they will teach you stuff, they show they care about\n   you, you're learning something. Here in Mexico, it was just whatever, if\n   you're doing fine, you're good. If you're not, well, we don't care about\n   you. But in the States, I had a counselor, that was new to me. And they\n   always looking after me, okay, so how you doing, what do you need help\n   with? So school, it was pretty fun. It was a whole new experience, I\n   actually started learning stuff. Yeah.\n \n"
