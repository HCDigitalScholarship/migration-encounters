  "text":"Abel: I don't want to defend the gang culture, but, I mean, we weren't\nmessing with innocent people. I mean, it was just a bunch of kids, we hung\nout. Our rivalry started from high school, from the football games. That's\nhow our rivalry started, with the other schools and stuff. That's how we\nstarted having, I guess, problems with other cities and stuff. But I mean,\neverybody talked to us. People weren't scared of us. I mean, \"Hey, how are\nyou doing? What's up?\" \"Hey, Juan.\" They would talk to us. We only had\nproblems with the people we didn't get along with. We weren't out there\ncausing a ruckus. I never was involved in selling drugs. I never got busted\nfor stealing. I never even got busted for shoplifting. I was a good kid. I\njust, I had that double life. I used to like to go hang out, but I always\nliked to work.\n      \n      "
