I don't know\n   what I am, so fuck it. I'm going to be a citizen of the world [Chuckles].\n   I'm going to take all of this and I'm going to be international. That's it.\n   That's it. We're going to be international. That's it, because genuinely,\n   honest to God, I don't know how to answer when somebody asks me.\n \n \n  "
