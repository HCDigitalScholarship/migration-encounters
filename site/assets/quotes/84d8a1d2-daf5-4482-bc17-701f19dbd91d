  "text":"Luis: But the worst part was knowing that I could not go back as easily as\n   I would like to because I was not a citizen. When I was twelve, my pa used\n   to explain to me what was I doing there, or what role I had in that\n   society. And it was difficult because knowing that no one liked me because\n   I didn't have any papers, all that hate that people has to refugees or\n   foreigners. Because whenever I went to school\u2026 Here is an example. There\n   was\u2014I never knew her name\u201a but there was a girl that's committed suicide\n   because she was, they bullied her every day. She was bullied every single\n   day of her life and that just made her feel horrible, like crap.\n \n \n   Anita: Where was she from?\n \n \n   Luis: I think she was from the Midwest. I believe she was... she\n   practiced\u2014I don't know the name of her religion. She was from the Midwest.\n   So, when I heard about her, and what I heard on my high school that she was\n   dead because of all that horrible stuff they told her, it's just like, that\n   could've happened to me. If I didn't know my kind of friends, if I didn't\n   have the kind of friend circle that I have, that could've happened to me. I\n   would be feeling like crap every single day.\n \n \n  "
