I like\n   Vikings, I like the 49ers, and Oakland too\u2014they have no difference to the\n   Raiders in Oakland, because the only difference is that bridge. But yes,\n   pretty much, I like a lot of teams that we used to do over there, that we\n   don't do over here. But I see them doing it. From here, too, I've got some\n   teams that I knew.\n \n \n  "
