  "text":"Then they put us in a big cellblock, and they would ask me, \"Why are you\n   here?\" I'd say, \"Just being illegal.\" And then I would ask them, \"Why are\n   you here?\" \"Oh, first degree murder, armed robbery, possession of\n   paraphernalia, drug trafficking.\" I was like, \"Wow. Well, I'm just\n   illegal.\" They were like, \"Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're\n   not as bad as we are.\" I was like, \"I hope not.\" It was whites, blacks,\n   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do\n   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,\n   and black people being with them. I said, \"Why? Why can't we all just be\n   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?\" But I guess I\n   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself\n   or defend your people.\n \n \n  "
