  "text":"Yair: Yeah, my parents in Arkansas. Sorry, my dad knows how to weld boats\n   and stuff. He's a welder, actually. My mom learned how to do it well, too.\n   They were there working for almost nine years, because I was there nine\n   years, living in Arkansas. I went to high school. I went to elementary,\n   first grade, and high school, and I made a lot of friends. I did a lot of\n   sports. I did basketball, football, baseball and track, running track.\n \n \n  "
