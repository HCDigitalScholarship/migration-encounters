  "text":"That\nsame week, I started going to kindergarten, got enrolled in school. It was\neasier back then. It was in the 70s. So I started going to pre-kinder. I\nwent to Mayflower Elementary School, all the way up to the fifth grade. I\ngraduated, and went to Clifton Junior High School. And then I went to\nMonrovia High. But it was a big process. My mom and dad both had to\nwork\u2014going for that American dream. I am the only child, so I found my\nfriends in the streets. So as a young kid, I started hanging out and I did\nbecome involved in the gang culture in LA.\n      \n      "
