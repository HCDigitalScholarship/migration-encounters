  "text":"Mike: No, no. Those papers that I have right now, I'm going to go ahead and\n   try to see if I could apply back, because they'd never fired me from\n   Teletech, I quit myself. And I was doing really good. I was actually doing\n   the dish program, and I was going to become a technician, but since all\n   that stuff happened and I had to move.\n \n \n   Mike: Because this is the reason that I moved, my dad was telling me that\n   rent was one thing, but he was just telling the landlord that he knew to\n   charge me extra. He was telling me it was 3,500, but the landlord was\n   keeping 2,500 and giving him 1,000 of it. And I had found out, because the\n   own landlord lady told me, and I had to move and I had to lose my job.\n \n \n  "
