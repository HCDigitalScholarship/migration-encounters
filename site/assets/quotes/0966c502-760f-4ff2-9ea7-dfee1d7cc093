  "text":"nd my little kid has gone through all\n   that, you know? And he's a teacher's pet, he's super smart, he's reading at\n   a 5th grade level and he's in 3rd grade. They had a little reading contest,\n   he beat the 5th grader.\n \n \n   Hugo: He got the best of me.\n \n \n   Anne: And do your parents help him out?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yes. Whenever they can, they go and take him, and they buy him food.\n   Last time, I sent them five pairs of shoes, a gang of pants, nice shirts,\n   nice sweaters. So, he knows I'm there.\n \n \n   Anne: That's good. Do you get to talk to him much?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yeah, I do. I talk to him almost every day. I have him on WhatsApp.\n \n \n   Anne: Do you have a picture?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yes. I just sent him a boat on Amazon, because he wanted a boat. Look\n   this is the video.\n \n \n   Anne: He's so cute. Is it remote control?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yes.\n \n \n   Anne: That is so cool.\n \n \n   Hugo: It was around $200 but he really wanted it, so whatever I can do for\n   my boy for him to feel I'm there, I will do it.\n \n \n  "
