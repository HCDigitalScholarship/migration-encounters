For one semester?\n \n \n   Laura: For one semester?\n \n \n   Anne: And did you go?\n \n \n   Laura: I try, but since I have to work and I have to go to school, I\n   couldn't manage that. It was too much for me. I couldn't. It was too much.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you didn't even try, I mean you did not go\u2014\n \n \n   Laura: I did one semester, but the rest of that I couldn't because I didn't\n   have any money. My family needed the money, so I try to help my mom, but\n   ... well it was not enough. The school in America's really expensive.\n   [Chuckles]\n \n \n   Anne: Did you enjoy college?\n \n \n   Laura: The only one semester I went, yeah, I did. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anne: And what were you hoping to do with college?\n \n \n   Laura: I was trying to get into the medical school. I was in liberal arts\n   of science, but I changed my mind and I wanted to get into the medical\n   school, but I couldn't. It was a lot of money. We didn't have any money. We\n   did have money to get into the basics, but we didn't have enough to pay my\n   school of course.\n \n \n  "
