  "text":"Luis: Well I don't know. I just think that the U.S.\u2014 they don't say it and\n   it\u2019s never going to be said\u2014but immigration, illegal immigration in the\n   United States is a business. They require that cheap labor. And right now\n   the only thing that they are trying to do is just to balance things out the\n   way they want it. Because illegal immigration is still going to be a thing, I\n   think, forever because they need people to exploit. Because at the end\n   of the day, we live in a capitalist society. And I understand that for me\n   to have these Calvin Klein shoes that I bought at Payless, somebody\n   else had suffer. For me to have a good life, somebody else needs to have a\n   bad life and that's just how the world works. But I think that just\n   understanding that fact and understanding that immigrant people in the U.S\n   are more than just assets. They are people, they have dreams. They could be\n   like a positive force for the communities. And just, I don't know. It's\n   just as difficult, because money rules the world I guess. And at the end of\n   the day, a lot of companies just don't care and they want cheap labor. And\n   a lot of people just want to pay less. Just understanding that things are\n   this way, that your wonderful life is wonderful because other people\n   suffer. I think that's just a huge, big step towards a better, more equal\n   society. Yeah, that's pretty much it.\n \n \n  "
