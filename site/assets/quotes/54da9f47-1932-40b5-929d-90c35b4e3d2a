  "text":"On the last\n   day of the month, I opened the freezer, and there's nothing in there.\n   Nothing at all. And I'm like, \"What am I going to do? What am I going to\n   feed my little brothers and sisters?\" And then I was just like, \"You know\n   what? I'm just going to go to the store and just steal something. A bag of\n   chips, whatever.\" So I go in the store and the guy was really nice. He was\n   an Arab guy. He was always telling me, \"Hey, just pay me back tomorrow.\"\n \n \n  "
