  "text":"Weco: Yeah, yeah. I was like, \"If you didn't catch me, I'd still be there\n   right now. But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a\n   reason.\" Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before\n   they deported me, I was like, \"Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got\n   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,\n   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation\n   is. But that's my record, running.\"\n \n \n   Weco: And I told him just like that. \"I'm actually trying to change. I got\n   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something\n   big, you know something big for me.\" But all I remember is actually him\n   asking my baby mama, \"Does he got insurance?\" She was like, \"Yeah. Anything\n   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.\" So I\n   just stood quiet. I was just like, \"All right.\" My judge, my lawyer was\n   like, \"Anything else?\" I just told him... I really went off. I just told\n   the judge, I was like, \"Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the\n   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take\n   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a\n   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You\n   ain't nobody to tell me shit. You ain't nobody. This courtroom ain't\n   nobody. These handcuffs ain't nobody.\n \n \n  "
