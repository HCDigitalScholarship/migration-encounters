I don't know, this new expression about bullying is\n     brand new. Bullying. You didn't have this here in Mexico. There was no\n     bullying. You just got out of the school, \"Okay, why are you doing this to\n     me,\" and you fight. That's it. No words, no nothing, no bullying. It was\n     like, \"I'm not fat. I'm not skinny. I'm not short.\" No. Teachers were very,\n     very strict. Also, my cousins my age, we lived this experience with the\n     teachers who were very strict. You don't do this, you don't do that. I\n     remember them having my hands or my fingers together and they had a ruler,\n     and they hit me if I didn't have the homework, if I was misbehaving.\n     Teachers were very\u2013 you have to respect them at that time. When you go to a\n     different country, and you had this Chicano culture that there, I mean, no\n     respect. It was like, \"No, that's not what I learned.\"\n \n \n    "
