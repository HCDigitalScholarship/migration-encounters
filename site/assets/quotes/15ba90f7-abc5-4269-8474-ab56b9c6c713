Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can\n   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're\n   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an\n   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the\n   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's\n   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and\n   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back\n   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't\n   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because\n   everyone's scared. You don't get the same rights.\n \n \n   Anita: When you say you feel more American than Mexican, what does that\n   mean to you to feel it? I mean, I know that you're not an American citizen.\n   What does it feel culturally or whatever way? In what way do you feel\n   American?\n \n \n   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an\n   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,\n   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be\n   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico\n   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of\n   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even\n   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means\n   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess\n   it would feel... I don't, I can't find the words.\n \n \n  "
