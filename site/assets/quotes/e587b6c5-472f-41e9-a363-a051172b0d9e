  "text":"Yes. There came a point. We were in the [Pause] process of getting\n   our permanent residency card in order to be able to go to school, and the\n   lawyer let my mother know that me and my sister\u2014my other sister\u2014were not\n   going to make it because once you hit eighteen, you're no longer under the\n   case that you originally filed, so the best option for us would be\n   adoption. We would be adopted by an American citizen in order to get our\n   American status fixed, and that was something my mom and I contemplated for\n   a long, long time, and she was going to go through with it, but my dad put\n   a huge stop to that and was like, \"That's not happening. You're stupid.\n   That's not a thing. These are my kids. You're not letting that happen.\"\n \n \n  "
