  "text":"Olimpya: I was really mad because I had so much things on me on that\n   moment, and it was so hard that I was like, \"Oi. Fuck it. I'm just going to\n   go and do what I have to do. I'm not going to let them hit me.\" So I hit\n   them back. She got really bad because I hit her really bad. Since I didn't\n   have stitches or anything, I was the one that got suspended and they didn't\n   do anything to her. I was like, \"I was just defending myself.\" It was like,\n   \"I don't care. You did this.\" \"I did it, but why? You need to look at the\n   background. Why did this happen? They're calling me names every single day.\n   They're doing this. They're ripping my books. They're hitting me. They're\n   pushing me. They can't do that to somebody and expect to just stay there.\"\n   They didn't care. The principal was like, \"No, you're suspended. You're\n   leaving.\"\n \n \n   Anita: What happened?\n \n \n   Olimpya: I spent a week at home. My mom was really mad at me because she\n   said I was taking everything in a really bad attitude, that it was just an\n   attitude problem because I wanted to go back, but it was impossible. I was\n   like, \"It's not that. It's just that you don't take me in consideration.\n   You don't see what's going on in my life. You're not looking at everything.\n   This is not a place for me. If I was saved once by my aunt that keep me\n   from everything that's going on right now with me, I shouldn't be going\n   through this. She did so much for me, so I didn't have to go through this.\n   And look at me where I am. The school is horrible. It's a jail.\" I can show\n   you. Well, right now, it's not that bad because they fix it up, but when I\n   was there, it was horrible. [Chuckling].\n \n \n   Anita: Was that here in Mexico City?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. Every time I pass that because I live really close, and\n   every time I pass by the school, I get really mad. I still have problems\n   with that because it's like... It gets me really mad. I was an excellent\n   student in California and here, when I got here, I barely passed the year.\n   It would get me frustrated because I was like, \"Hey, I already saw this\n   back in the States. This was third-grade things.\" I'm like, \"Come on,\" but\n   I couldn't remember. I couldn't do it even though I knew I could, and I\n   knew it. It was really frustrating for me. I was just\u2014\n \n \n  "
