I remember going inside\n   the Walmart \u2018cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and\n   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel\n   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to\n   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas\u2014we got stranded\n   in Texas. Yeah, ",
