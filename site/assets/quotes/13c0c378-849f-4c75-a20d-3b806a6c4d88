  "text":"That, too. I feel like a lot of us that have come back, we don't have that\n   opportunity to continue our education because we don't have the money. We\n   don't have \u2013 Including just to get your ID here, you go through a lot. You\n   have to take a lot of documents that you don't even know if you have. A lot\n   of people that came back, they don't even know what Mexico is like. Even\n   trying to get an education, what are we going to study? What career can we\n   make, or can we select to become part of a helpful community? My best guess\n   is languages, not only English but other languages like French or German. I\n   think if we want to be a first world country, we have to act like it.\n   That's where our government is not putting its full potential because we do\n   have the resources, but they're so corrupted that they'd rather keep that\n   to themselves.\n \n \n  "
