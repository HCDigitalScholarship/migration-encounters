  "text":"My mom used to always say that we were kind of nomads\n   because we weren't from the States. We were raised there but we're not from\n   the States, but we weren't from Mexico either because we may have been born\n   here, but we didn't know anything about it.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you still feel that way now? Like a nomad?\n \n \n   Laila: Sometimes it does. It does feel difficult like that, it does. It may\n   be a little bit easier now because I'm a lot older and I kind of understand\n   a couple of more things, but it does feel like I don't belong in Mexico.\n \n \n  "
