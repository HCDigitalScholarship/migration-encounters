  "text":"Anita: So even though you were working in an immigration coalition that\n   helped people apply for DACA, you didn't apply for it?\n \n \n   Melani: I never applied for it. I even went to an attorney and they told me\n   it's better if you go to Mexico before you\u2019re eighteen\u2014I mean after you're\n   eighteen or before. After you're eighteen, you had to wait 180 days\u2014I mean\n   you have to not exceed 180 days\u2014so you can be able to apply and not have\n   that ten-year sentence of not being able to apply for a US visa.\n \n \n   My mom would say, \" you know what? It's better if you just go back to\n   Mexico and go to a Mexican university and we'll support you from here, from\n   the States.\"\n \n \n   I came alone. I came a month ago. I told my mom, \"I don't want to leave. I\n   want to stay here [in the US],\" because in my heart I felt like the\n   government would do something for the DREAMers. In my heart I felt that,\n   but my mom said, \"You're just wasting your time. You need to leave, because\n   even if they do something for DREAMers, it will take a lot of time to\n   implement that law, and you would lose maybe one or two years of college --\n   you can come back and visit us,\" and I said, \"Well, you're right.\"\n \n \n   I applied to Mexican universities, but they told me I would have to restart\n   my high school and that my ACT and my SAT weren't accepted. I would have to\n   do their admissions tests, but they have a lot of requirements that aren't\n   requirements back home, and so I decided to apply to other countries. I\n   applied to Australia and New Zealand and Canada, and I got in all three of\n   them in various universities. And I chose Canada since Australia and New\n   Zealand are way too far away from Mexico City\u2014it's like thirty-six hours.\n \n \n   And I said well it's better if I go to Canada since it will be five hours\n   away and I could come on vacation, and I applied. I got into four\n   universities in Canada and I got scholarships from them.\n \n \n   I chose one in Vancouver\u2014Douglas College first, and I got a full\n   scholarship from there. So I chose it and I went there three weeks ago. So,\n   I came here [from US to Mexico] a month and a week ago\u2014to Mexico City. The\n   first week I stayed with my dad's side of the family.\n \n \n   The next week I went to Vancouver to visit my school, and I also found out\n   that in Vancouver if you study four years in a Canadian university, you can\n   get your citizenship in the sixth year. And I thought that was a great\n   opportunity, and when I went there, I felt like it was more immigrant\n   friendly since all of them were Asian. Well, there's a lot of Asian\n   influence -- Asian, Muslim, all types of cultures, a lot of Hispanics, and\n   I felt like they were more welcoming and multicultural than back home.\n \n \n  "
