  "text":"Anne: What did your dad do when he was working in Utah?\n \n \n   Juan: From what my dad told me is, initially, he worked in a farm\u2026 I think\n   it was strawberries, something to do with fruit. He would pick them out,\n   but I think he was there for a year, a year and a half, he saw that he\n   wasn't making much money so he started to get into the construction\n   industry. That's where he was able to save up money so we can go with him,\n   and after that, he's always been in the construction industry.\n \n \n  "
