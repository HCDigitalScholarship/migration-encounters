  "text":"Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into\n kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and\n me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my\n home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.\n So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my\n first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and\n it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff\n a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more\n understanding and I was getting it really quick.\n      \n      \n"
