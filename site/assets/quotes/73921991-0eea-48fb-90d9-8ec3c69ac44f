  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n     You had a strong home environment. Your mother and father were there?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Yes, yes.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     They were happy?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     They were happy because they didn't know what I was going through. I never\n     told them my experiences at school because of the respect I have. I knew if\n     I would tell them something that I was going through, because of Mexican\n     culture before, they were very strict. I was afraid of telling them, \"You\n     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties\"\n     because my dad would tell me, \"You're just going to study. That's why\n     you're going. You're just going to study. Don't pay attention to anything,\n     and I don't want you to do anything stupid. You're to go to school and\n     that's it.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I knew his answer already. I knew what he was going to tell me, so I just\n     decided just to continue with my stuff. Now that I'm older. We have this\n     conversation. I had this conversation with him. \"Did you know about me\n     having these difficulties with Chicanos, with black people? Did you know\n     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?\" \"No. How\n     come you didn't tell me?\" \"Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was\n     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,\n     you, you were not going to take me back to Mexico because we were already\n     here.\" He's like, \"I didn't know.\"\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     How did you resist becoming a gang member?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I resisted because I really didn't like it. Because of the culture here in\n     Mexico, you don't fight for a street. Don't fight for a street. We fight, I\n     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not\n     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, \"Oh, that's your\n     street? You own it? Go for it.\" I'm like, \"It's your street? What about the\n     street? That's good.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Thank you so m"
