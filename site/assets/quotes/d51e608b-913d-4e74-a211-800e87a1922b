  "text":"Anita: Do you remember your first day in LA?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah, they took me to a... they had these little swap meets close.\n   Swap meets. I remember they took me there and they bought me clothes,\n   pants, shoes. They knew that I liked playing on the little machines, so\n   they gave me coins. They were there with me. Like my madrina, she's like\n   another mother. While my mom and my dad would be working, she would take\n   care of me and I actually called her mom as well. My mom didn't like it,\n   but she's the one that actually paid for us to stay. And then once we got\n   on our feet, we moved to another part of LA near Bell Gardens. I started\n   going to school there and we used to live in a garage and I didn't like\n   living in the garage cause I was like, \"isn't this for a car?\" My mom would\n   be like, \"yeah, but we're only going to be here for a few months.\"\n \n \n  "
