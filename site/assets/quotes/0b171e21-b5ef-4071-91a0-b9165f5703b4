  "text":"Zayuri: Yeah. The memes that are funny in Spanish is so hard to translate\n   to other people. For example, my roommate, she speaks English and Spanish,\n   but she's completely from here. She has never lived in another country. She\n   has visited other countries, but she just has lived here. Sometimes I'm\n   laughing at a meme from the United States or even worse ones, the German\n   ones, are so hard to me to translate, because I'm trying to, \u201cOkay, you see\n   this picture right here? Let me put you in context.\u201d Then there's like a 30\n   minute rant trying to explain the context. And that's why it's funny. \u201cYou\n   get it?\u201d \u201cNo.\u201d I try. That's it.\n \n \n  "
