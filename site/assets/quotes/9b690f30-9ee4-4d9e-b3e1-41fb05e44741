  "text":"Lizzy: But it's a good dream. What about here in Mexico? Is there something\n that you wish people understood about migrants like you that have lived in\n the US and have come back to Mexico?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Well, to think things differently. To have a different approach on\n things because over there, it's more liberal in the States. They reserve\n some things, but if you ask them for help, they might be more willing to\n help you than here, because everybody here is super sketchy: \"I don't know\n if you're going to rob me, I don't know if you're going to do this.\u201d If I\n go out and I ask somebody, \"Can I borrow five bucks just to get home?\"\n They're not going to want to do it because they think I'm just going to go\n and get high or whatever. A lot of people judge me, even here. They think\n I'm bad or something. I don't know why. Last time I got kicked out of a\n store, I went to go buy bread and whatever. I was in the store, and this\n guy got super crazy. He's like, \"No, you're going to rob me.\" He pulled out\n a knife and he's like, \"You're going to rob me, you're going to rob me.\" I\n was like, \"What the hell, dude? I'm just trying to buy bread.\" [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n"
