  "text":"Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going\n to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to\n meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a\n year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,\n \"Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just\n going to do a polygraph test.\" I heard about them and I heard that some\n people were like, \"Yeah, they don't really work.\" But I had my doubts about\n that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.\n If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know\n that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an\n advantage of people.\n      \n      \n Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There\n were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't\n supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since\n I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an\n assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people\n younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to\n all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my\n school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also\n hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at\n because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.\n If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.\n      \n      \n"
