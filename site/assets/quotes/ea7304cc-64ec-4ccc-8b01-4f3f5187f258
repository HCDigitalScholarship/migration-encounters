  "text":"Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in\n   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, \"We have to do it\n   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's\n   already waiting for us.\" So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have\n   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we\n   went over to a motel\u2014and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is\n   like... or I have this huge angel or something.\n \n \n   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was\n   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people\n   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,\n   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two\n   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know\n   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in\n   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any\n   English\u2014she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and\n   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my\n   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.\n \n \n   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment\n   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,\n   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and\n   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and\n   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,\n   so nice.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, \"Okay, so,\n   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and\n   we'll see you guys when we cross.\" So, we were on our own. And I remember\n   asking my mom, \"Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?\" And she\n   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her\n   mind went blank. I was like, \"Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it\n   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these\n   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went\n   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed\n   my mom's hand and I'm like, \"Mom, let's just go.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just\n   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want\n   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I\n   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I\n   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?\n \n \n   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and\n   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've\n   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people\n   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back\n   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a\n   van...\n \n \n   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when\n   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and\n   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best\n   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two\n   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then\n   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.\n \n \n  "
