  "text":"Claudia: And so, how did you learn English? Did you go to school?\n \n \n   Ilse: I was very lucky too on that perspective because, like I said, when\n   we got there, it was a really small community, and my school only had a few\n   Latin people. But the school actually had teachers, English teachers. They\n   were so nice to me, and I was able to get one-on-one classes, and it was so\n   personalized, and they were so committed. Even my regular teacher, she was\n   Ms. ___, and I'll never forget her. She was so nice to me, and she would\n   help me so much. I've always been a really good student, and I always\n   wanted my grades, and do good in everything. And I was really good in math,\n   obviously because it was numbers, and I was always top in that area, in\n   that subject. But then when it came to reading and everything, it was kind\n   of complicated, so she helped me so much. She paid so much attention to me,\n   and thank God, I was able to learn the language in a few months thanks to\n   them.\n \n \n   Ilse: And thanks to my dad pushing me, too, because there were things that\n   we had to do, and he didn't have a translator. So, I had to do it for him.\n   That helped out a lot. So, I would say I learned in nine months tops.\n \n \n  "
