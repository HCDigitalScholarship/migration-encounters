  "text":"Anne: I see.\n      \n      \n Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot\n of family members, including my wife go, \"Why are you leaving? Why are you\n going to Mexico City? You don't need to.\u201d I go, \"Well one I'm going, I want\n to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I\n know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real\n job.\u201d Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,\n but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,\n that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in\n that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I\n can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down\n there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but\n I'm a city person [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?\n      \n      \n Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19\u2014well no, I got in\n trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't\n fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because\n I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,\n because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at\n least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,\n three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,\n \u201cSit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.\u201d\n Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My\n wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was\n the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,\n \"We gotta go,\u201d so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and\n they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go\n at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran\n over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was\n easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they\n come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive\n then the season pass.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're\n still going to Disney.\n      \n      \n Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the\n states.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.\n It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work\n back over there wasn't, but my volunteer\u2026 Like helping out at the school\n whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I\n was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was\n going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.\n      \n      \n Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they\n started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually\n my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when\n they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because\n they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, \"You know I'm not that\n knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over\n myself.\u201d And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you\n say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy\n their faith.\n      \n      \n Anne: Don't want to do that.\n      \n      \n Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the\n school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're\n still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're\n right there. But good thing \u2026. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a\n pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty\n well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been\n a long ride. [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies\n or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What\n was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most\n important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is\n environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in\n the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not\n going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I\n focus with my wife is that\u2014well my parents, they provided a good\n environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped\n that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told\n a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America\u2014not just with\n Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever\u2014is a lot of people yell\n out racism or discrimination.\n      \n      \n Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,\n that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because\n weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends\n of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's\n not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was\n out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment\n that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church\u2014I\n was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was\n part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.\n      \n      \n Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them\n to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our\n relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt\n comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable\n around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they\n don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I\n honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: Right.\n      \n      \n Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but\n I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good\n person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll\n break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really\n supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,\n and if he's willing\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: It might work out.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah, it might work out.\n      \n      \n Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a\n goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I\n had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.\n      \n      \n Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make\n it through\u2026?\n      \n      \n Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could\n probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have\n land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make\n some money here. There\u2019s just several different ideas. But I know that I\n can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are\n making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as\n telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.\n You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.\n      \n      \n Anne: Right.\n      \n      \n Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.\n      \n      \n"
