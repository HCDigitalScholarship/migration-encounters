What was the city that you moved to when you first moved?\n      \n      \n Axel: When I first moved over there, we were in Texas, and then mom was\n always big about moving around. She always wanted to... It was always her\n idea of looking for a better life, the American dream, whatever you say. So\n she was always trying to upgrade to a new house and better location for\n schools, better location for a family, stuff like that. So we went all over\n Texas.\n      \n      \n"
