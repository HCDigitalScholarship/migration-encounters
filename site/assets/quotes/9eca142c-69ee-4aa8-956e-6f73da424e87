  "text":"Diana: Well, when I started hanging out with ... I started getting to the\n   gangs and stuff over there so ... and I would cut school, and then I would\n   get into fights stuff like that.\n \n \n   Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so\n   exciting about gangs?\n \n \n   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,\n   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school\n   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good\n   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over\n   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching\n   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with\n   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of\n   alone time.\n \n \n  "
