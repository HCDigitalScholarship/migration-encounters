  "text":"Anita: Tell me about your mom's work.\n \n \n   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting\n   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because\n   reading transports you to different places and different languages and\n   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been\n   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,\n   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design\n   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, \"You\n   know what? I'm going to be independent,\" so she moves aside. She starts her\n   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.\n \n \n   Luisa: I remember all of these black people coming to my home and they\n   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to\n   watch. We went to their homes, I think\u2014[Pause] I don't remember his name,\n   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the\n   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their\n   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three\n   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was\n   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was\n   great. I got to meet a lot of people.\n \n \n   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,\n   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the\n   attire?\n \n \n   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would\n   come like, \u201cWhat\u2026?\u201d Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was\n   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with\n   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It\n   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],\n   that\u2019s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took\n   over.\n \n \n   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he\n   and my mother were very\u2014they would joke around. It was extremely funny to\n   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would\n   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, \"Oh, my God. What's\n   happening?\" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually\n   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,\n   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.\n   They were great people.\n \n \n  "
