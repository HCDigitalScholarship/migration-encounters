Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot\n   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.\n   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all\n   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and\n   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the\n   \u2013 it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position\n   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's\n   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that\n   kind of things.\n \n \n  "
