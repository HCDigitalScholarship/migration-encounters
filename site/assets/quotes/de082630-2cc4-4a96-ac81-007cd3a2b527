  "text":"Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, \"Hey, but I don't want\n   to go back with you.\" So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my\n   family. They do that to me, and I was like, \"Ugh.\" So I started getting mad\n   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, \"Hey, this\n   thing is really small,\" because, in the States, house are really big. And\n   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, \"Hey, where am I\n   going to live? I need my space.\" So I started being really rude. I started\n   being a bad girl.\n \n \n  "
