  "text":"I think I really enjoy the culture that\n they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having\n worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to\n do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been\n really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very\n different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they\n are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up\n in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's\n to the point"
