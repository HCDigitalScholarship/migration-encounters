  "text":"Anne: How do you think living in the US for sixteen years, how did it\n   change you?\n \n \n   Many: Well, living in the United States, it was very nice. It was amazing\n   because I have a lot of friends on United States, and the culture. I like\n   the way people live in the United States and everything. I have a lot of\n   friends, white boys and black guys. I have a lot of friends and they was\n   real, real nice friends. They helped me a lot when I have a bad situation.\n   Remember when I told you that this girl left me with the kids?\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah.\n \n \n   Many: So, I have a lot of friends. They was helping me out with kids. I\n   have a good memories of living on the United States than here in Mexico\n   because in Mexico, it's nice, it's beautiful in Mexico, but I don't know.\n   There's something wrong in Mexico. There's something different. I don't\n   know how I can explain to you, but it's something that I don't feel\n   comfortable living here in Mexico because... I don't know if it's the\n   government. Sometimes we don't have the same opportunities here being the\n   Mexicans, living in Mexico.\n \n \n  "
