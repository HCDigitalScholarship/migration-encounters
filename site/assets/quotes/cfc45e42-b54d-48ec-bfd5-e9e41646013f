  "text":"Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird\n   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.\n   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if\n   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll\n   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really\n   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,\n   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,\n   not because they're forcing me too.\n \n \n  "
