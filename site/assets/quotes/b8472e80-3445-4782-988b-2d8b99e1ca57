People know that obviously we get some\n decent money because we speak English. They know the days that we get paid.\n The people that live around here in the streets and the cops know when we\n get paid, so there's cops out here every day, roaming around just looking\n and they see anybody with tattoos, they'll pull you over and search you.\n It's probable cause, supposedly.\n      \n      \n"
