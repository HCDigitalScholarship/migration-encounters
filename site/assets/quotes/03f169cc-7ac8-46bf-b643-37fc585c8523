  "text":"Weco: So, I was like, \"Man. We've got an hour to get there. I got an hour\n   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one.\" So, during that process,\n   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.\n \n \n   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on\n   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a\n   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not\n   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing\n   we was going to get to, I said, \"All right. We finna get off the freeway.\n   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.\"\n \n \n   Isabel: How old were you?\n \n \n   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.\n \n \n   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in\n   that moment?\n \n \n   Weco: My mind was just like, \"Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going\n   to be my life. He ain't going to...\" I looked at it like just, \"What? Just\n   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal\n   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going\n   to have to catch me.\" That's the way I looked at it. \u201cYou're fucking with\n   the wrong one.\u201d\n \n \n   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?\n \n \n   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was\n   like, \"Man, it's now or never.\" So, I just went ahead and got up. First\n   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.\n   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the\n   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was\n   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab\n   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went\n   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,\n   \"What am I doing?\" I'm like, \"Man, I just made this worse.\" So, I was like,\n   \"I might as well just complete with it.\"\n \n \n   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?\n \n \n   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I\n   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, \"I\n   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it.\" So, I just\n   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,\n   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through\n   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.\n \n \n   Isabel: So, what happened?\n \n \n   Weco: They didn't find me.\n \n \n   Isabel: What?\n \n \n   Weco: They didn't find me. It took them four days to find me.\n \n \n  "
