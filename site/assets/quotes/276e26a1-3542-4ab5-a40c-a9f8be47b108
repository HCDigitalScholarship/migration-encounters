  "text":"Rodolfo: Literally, I spoke to a person who said, \u201cMan, if I do bad things\n   here they're going to want to keep me here.\u201d What type of mentality is\n   that? That they rather commit crimes while in detention so they can stay in\n   the United States but not even that, they are going to be locked up.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: So, that reality, that part where their mind has set on, \u201cOkay\n   well, I'd rather be in jail here then go back to my home country. Because\n   I'm going to be, at least, with my family here, so they can go visit me and\n   stuff like that.\u201d That's very.., that's horrible. So yeah, that. That would\n   be awesome if somebody is in detention, if somebody is detained, they can\n   get visits from their family. Just people who are detained, you know?\n \n \n   Sergio: Just wanting to hug your mom\u2014\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Yeah. Because a visit does all the difference, man. You know what\n   I mean? Seeing that little help, it's like a beacon of hope, you know?\n   Okay, well, one day or hopefully or just keeping that alive.\n \n \n   Sergio: I think that's all the questions I have right now, I might come up\n   with more later to ask you again. But right now, do you have anything on\n   your mind that you want to share or talk about?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Man, it's been awhile since I spoke about any of this, but I feel\n   I've let everything... or for now because I have a lot, a lot more. But for\n   now, I feel like it was good. It's like a little therapy session as well,\n   man. Honestly, to be quite frank with you, that's what I was looking for,\n   man. Because I don't really have any friends like that, and I don't know\n   anybody out here like that and it's just great to finally speak and be\n   heard.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I know it's your job and I know it's your school and everything\n   but man, I feel like you really were listening to me and thank you. Thank\n   you man, rea"
