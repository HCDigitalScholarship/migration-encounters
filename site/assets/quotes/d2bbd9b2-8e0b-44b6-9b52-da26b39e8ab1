  "text":"Juan: Because there's a lot of potential in Mexico that I didn't see\n   because I was in the US, but now that I'm here, I see how my actual home\n   country is. I know if I work hard, I can make an impact to my society. I\n   can make a change, and that's pretty much my goal. I want to make an\n   impact. I want to use my architectural skills and my construction skills\n   that I'm developing right now.\n \n \n  "
