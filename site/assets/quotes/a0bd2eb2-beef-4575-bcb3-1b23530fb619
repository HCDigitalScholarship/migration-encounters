It was extremely funny to\n   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would\n   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, \"Oh, my God. What's\n   happening?\" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually\n   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,\n   very, very, very nice. I visited their home quite a few times in Hyde Park.\n   They were great people.\n \n \n  "
