  "text":"I don't know if\n   I started going off a little bit off track during middle school\n \n \n   Miguel: I think the people I started meeting there, they had older brothers\n   and older siblings that they knew more about, maybe drugs, gangs, weapons,\n   and things like that. So my curiosity brought me to try to see what that\n   was about. I didn't get involved in gangs too much, but being Hispanic, I\n   think that was kind of part of our culture, you can say. Not to be in the\n   gang, but to have a family member or know somebody that's in one and things\n   like that. Drugs wasn't really a big issue for me, I didn't have a drug\n   addiction to the point where I needed help or anything like that.\n \n \n  "
