I'm going out to Mexico.\" And I got to say thanks and that's it.\n   And he actually tried\u2014when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a\n   lot\u2014he's telling me, \"Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or\n   something.\" I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of\n   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was\n   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive\n   out here to do something. You can't really do much.\n \n \n  "
