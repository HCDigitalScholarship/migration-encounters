  "text":"Ivan: Let's see here. I will say that the United States made me\u2026 more\n   adaptable to any situation. Any situation I can go through, like I will\n   adapt to. And that's what the United States taught me, be adapt to any\n   situation. And what else, and socially speaking and professionally\n   speaking, like I became a really adaptable person. That's what I learned\n   from the States. And of course, the language comes with it, speaking two\n   languages. I think anywhere in Latin America it\u2019s a plus. So that was it,\n   it made me a really adaptable person.\n \n"
