Sometimes for a month or two he's okay and they talk\n   to him a lot. She's like his behavior at school sometimes is\u2014I don't know\n   because he have dark hair. Or I told her you ought to be careful with\n   bullying, maybe it's that and she's not that very involved with him at\n   school and everything. But sometimes, like right now, it's getting better.\n   But when he's nervous \u2026he gets in middle school already and he told my\n   friend I'm very afraid to go to school. So he begins to eat and eat and\n   right now he is very big. But we talked to him a lot so I don't know what's\n   going to happen. It\u2019s still problems with\u2014\n \n \n  "
