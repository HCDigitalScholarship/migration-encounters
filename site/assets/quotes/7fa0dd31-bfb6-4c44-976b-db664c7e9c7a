  "text":"Ben: Well, the thing is that I had, when I was 19 I had a brush with\n the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they\n didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they\n left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something\n happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I\n tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a\n pretty high, outrageous bond and\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: When you were 19?\n      \n      \n Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I\n was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh wow.\n      \n      \n Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and\n then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to\n Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm\n going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, \"No,\u201d so\n I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the\n attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was\n a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years\n at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked\n the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to\n Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before\n Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico."
