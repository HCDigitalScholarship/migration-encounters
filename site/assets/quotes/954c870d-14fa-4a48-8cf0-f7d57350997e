  "text":"Sergio: Why did your family migrate to the US?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: The reason why my family moved to the US was because both my\n   grandfather and my biological fathers struggled with addiction, with\n   alcoholism and drug abuse. They were just not very... Mostly my biological\n   father, he really wasn't always there, and he was always very violent\n   towards my mother. My mother had me when she was 14 years old. When she got\n   pregnant everybody decided well, okay, she messed up. She is this, that,\n   like very, very taboo. She wasn't really accepted in the family anymore. It\n   wasn't so much my family and I moving to the US, it was just my mother and\n   I when she was 16 and I was two and a half years old. They weren't really\n   interested in what was going on with me or my mother. She just wanted a\n   better quality of life for her and for myself.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: In Mexico at 16 years old, with no type of education past probably\n   middle school, she knew she wasn't gonna get very far. I guess she made\n   that decision in order to have a better quality of life for her and myself,\n   she went on. She was 16, and I don't know how she did it. I don't know the\n   details and all that, but she met the right people, or she got in contact\n   with the right people, and she went over there. She went to the United\n   States."
