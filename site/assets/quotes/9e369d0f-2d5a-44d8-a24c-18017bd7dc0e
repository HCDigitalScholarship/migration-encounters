And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,\n   \"Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.\n   I don't like you.\" They would be like that, and it was starting from my\n   family, so it hurt. I was like, \"How come in a country where I'm not like\n   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?\"\n   You know? So that was the first hit.

They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.\" That was the\n   easiest way for me, but she said, \"No, you got to come back with me because\n   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.\"\n   Like my dad, at the house.\n \n \n  "
