  "text":"Yair: My dream was to be a producer, music producer, because I really liked\n   music. I remember that I spoke with my music teacher. She gave me this disc\n   that has a lot of things that you can do, for you to do instrumentals and\n   stuff. I did it. I didn't know anything, but I think I'm good at it, making\n   instrumentals for music. I really liked that, and I wanted to study that or\n   to become one of the producers and stuff, because I like music. The other\n   of my dreams was for me to have a house, my own car, and also get married\n   and have a family. That was most of my dreams. Yeah, that's about it, I\n   think.\n \n \n  "
