  "text":"I'm like, \"Mom, everything happens for a reason. Everything happens\n for a reason. Every single thing is either whether you believe it or not,\n everything happens for a reason. There is already a plan for you type\n thing.\" I believe in that type of stuff and I went to church when I was\n younger. I did go to church when I was in junior high, and it was nice. It\n taught me a lot of stuff and I do believe in God. I'm not going to say I'm\n a follower, but I do believe in Him and I do believe in what they believe\n here, which is La Santa Muerte, [Saint Death] and I believe in death.\n      \n      \n Axel: If there's one thing that everybody believes in, it's death. Because\n everybody says, nothing is promised but death. That's one for sure thing\n that we all have is that. Believing in the death here, believing in La\n Santa Muerte [Saint Death] like the guys, it's a lot more credible. It's\n like yeah, we know death is there. God, everybody says God is here, there's\n the books and the testaments, there's no really actual evidence besides the\n books. Yeah, there's some stuff that do... I like that type of stuff and it\n gets my mind over, but I was never too much of a follower. My mom didn't\n like that. She was like, \"You need to take it seriously.\" I was like, \"I\n am, but it's already happened. It's already done and it's already\n happening, it's in process, what can I do about it? I can just hope for the\n best and prepare for the worst.\"\n      \n      \n"
