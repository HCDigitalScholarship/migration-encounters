  "text":"Noe: One example from the subway, there's a lot of people that they don't\n   care about the others. I always tell it to my friends when I get to speak\n   about the city that when I came here, I was giving seats to the ladies, to\n   the girls. \u201cHey, take a seat and everything.\u201d The people get crowded at the\n   door when the subway open the door, they just get crowded. Everybody wants\n   to get in. I was like, for real, just stepping aside, just trying to let\n   them go, and then I get in. Now? Nah. They crowd in, I go too. I have to be\n   like, \u201cI don't give a damn about you.\u201d There are ladies forties, maybe\n   fifties, they're nice, but I'm not giving my chair. Only if I see a really\n   elderly lady, \u201cOkay, just take a seat there.\u201d That makes a big change on\n   you and how you were raised. It's a lot of, the city takes a lot from you:\n   take your manners, take your... If you're kind to people, get ready,\n   because this city is going to change you.\n \n \n  "
