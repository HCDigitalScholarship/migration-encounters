  "text":"rik: The Mexican government, what I would tell them, not about the\n   migrants, but the whole society. We live in a rich country which, from the\n   conquerors until today, they come to administrate the government and only\n   take out, and take out, and take out, and do not give nothing to the\n   people. I don't know if that makes sense. It's not like, only to the\n   immigrants, society. Mexico is rich. We produce oil. And we buy gasoline?\n   It's ridiculous. You know? I would tell the government, go to the United\n   States and you want to regret those... They call the tratamientos - [trade]\n \n \n   Anita: trades?\n \n \n   Erik: The trades from Bucareli. It's like a secret treatise where American\n   government do not let the Mexican government to be self-sufficient over the\n   country. So we can\u2019t. I would say cancel those treatments because they\n   belong to secrecy and develop the Mexican country. We don't have to be and\n   make the country rich; we can make our own country rich.\n \n \n  "
