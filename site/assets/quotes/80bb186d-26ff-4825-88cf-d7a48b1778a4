  "text":"Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I\n used to go. Everybody was like, \"Where were you last two years?\" Somebody\n started a rumor I was in Canada. Some people knew where I were, because I\n kept in contact with a couple people and they knew exactly where I were.\n Everything went back to normal once I got back to school. Once I got off,\n they did give me six months of probation and I didn't do anything. I was\n doing exactly what they wanted me. From work, from house to school, from\n school to the house. No time in between at all, no walks with anybody,\n nothing. It was like all right, going to school, cool. Got to school,\n school's out, okay, I'm going home. \"Hey, come stay, come go for an ice\n cream.\" Nope. I got to go home.\n      \n      \n Axel: Just six months after that, I would probably go out with them for a\n drink, I would go out with them for a game of basketball, football,\n swimming, anything but just not right now.\n      \n      \n"
