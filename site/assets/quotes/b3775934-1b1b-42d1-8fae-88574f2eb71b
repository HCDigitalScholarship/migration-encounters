  "text":"My literature\n   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one\n   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting\n   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes\n   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're\n   all bros and he learns to speak their language\u2014not very well, but he\n   learns.\n \n \n   Luisa: The sparrow gets old and keeps living there and he's like, \"You know\n   what? I love this place and I love my friends, and even though it kills me\n   to leave all my friends behind here in the jungle, I need to go back to my\n   home,\" [Chokes up] so the sparrow makes his journey and he dies. He makes\n   it to the snow and he dies looking at the tree where he had his nest.\n   [Crying] My literature teacher I think was pretty impacted by that. He was\n   pretty understanding.\n \n \n  "
