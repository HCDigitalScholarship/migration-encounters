They came to me, they put a knife on my neck, and\n   another one in my stomach, like say, \u201cDon't move, don't move.\u201d But as they\n   say that, I didn't show that I was afraid of them. I was just like, \u201cOkay,\n   calm down. Take whatever you want. Don't do anything stupid, something like\n   that.\u201d I didn't want to do anything\u2014hit back or something and run\n   away\u2014because I was with the girl. I was just more scared about her. She was\n   super scared. I was like, \u201cJust take that, just go.\u201d Yeah, after that,\n   there was a police station two blocks from there.\n \n \n  "
