  "text":"Anita: I want to ask you one more question. Something that we're working on\n   is\u2026 what the US is losing and what Mexico could gain because of people\n   leaving like you out of fear or because of deportation. What do you think\n   the US loses by losing people like you?\n \n \n   Melani: Well, they're losing their own people -- people like me and\n   thousands and millions of others that never really knew their country and\n   grew up in the US and consider that their country. I would've given\n   everything for it because I feel like that's my home.\n \n \n   They're losing all our knowledge, what we could have studied and also given\n   back to our communities and country: new research, work, new ways of\n   thinking, new technology, and a lot of things that they could have had, but\n   don't, [because] we can't.\n \n \n   And when we come back it's even worse because you feel like there's no\n   opportunity, no way out, because they put so many barriers here, like\n   telling me that I can't go to college because\u2014well, I understand it -- but\n   a lot of foreigners come and they don't know any Mexican history and they\n   go directly into college, and I don't understand why I can't, why deportees\n   can't and why Japanese people or white people from England or Britain can\n   come and go directly in without knowing any history or almost minimum\n   Spanish?\n \n \n  "
