  "text":"Olimpya: I think I changed my attitude a little bit. I said, \"Okay. If I'm\n   going to stay here, I'm going to do everything so when I'm older, I can\n   leave this place.\" [Chuckles]. That was what I was always thinking about.\n   After I finished middle school, I went onto high school. I was studying\n   tourism. It was really cool, but then I got some friends that weren't\n   really nice. [Chuckles]. So, I remember that's when I met alcohol. The\n   school was really open. They wouldn't check on your backpacks. They\n   wouldn't check on you like, \"It's your responsibility to come to school,\n   stay in school, and do your work. It's not ours. It's yours.\" Basically,\n   what we used to do in the mornings, we had to be at school at 5:00 AM\n   because we used to cook in the morning. Then around 7:00\u2014we had, 7:00 to\n   8:00, a break. So we would call breakfast, but most of the time, when we\n   would go breakfast, we would buy beers or stuff like that, and put it in\n   cups and stuff. We would go back to school and be drinking during classes.\n   So by 12:00, we were drunk. [Chuckles]. We wouldn't do anything. We would\n   just be, \"Yeah, yeah.\" Trying to study, but not doing nothing at all.\n \n \n  "
