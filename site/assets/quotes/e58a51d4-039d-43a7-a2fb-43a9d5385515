  "text":"Yair: But yeah, that's most of my experiences. My experience here in\n   Mexico, it's a big change because it's a city. There's a lot of danger. Not\n   a lot of danger, but it depends on what area you live in because not all\n   areas are bad, and some areas are really calm and nice. But if you live ...\n   What do they say? In the hood or stuff, there's a lot of crime and a lot of\n   people that sells drugs, and a lot of killing also. But most of the time I\n   don't deal with those type of people. I try to stay away from them. I have\n   friends that are like that, but I don't want to be in that situation. I\n   don't want to be engaged with them, to hang out with them, because even\n   though ... If I hang out with them or stuff, I know maybe someday I'll be\n   in trouble or something. I don't know.\n  "
