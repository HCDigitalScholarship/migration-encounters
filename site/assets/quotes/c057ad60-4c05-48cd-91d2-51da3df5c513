  "text":"Lizzy: In what ways is the lifestyle different here from the US?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Well, what I miss the most is the food. It's super multicultural\n over there, you can get all kinds of food from every single place in the\n world practically. You get Asian, you get Arab, anything you want, you can\n get it, and everything tastes good. Right here, it's all the same food. And\n it\u2019s like, \u201cUgh.\u201d\n      \n      \n Lizzy: What food do you miss the most?\n      \n      \n Jesus: What I would cook. [Laughs]. Yeah, because you would have all the\n ingredients at the palm of your hands. Here, you can't even get pepper.\n They only get crushed or in little balls.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So, it's harder to find the stuff you need for cooking?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. It's just all the same stuff. Chicken. They don't even have\n different kinds of cuts of meats, stuff like that. Everything's super\n expensive.\n      \n      \n"
