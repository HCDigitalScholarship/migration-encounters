  "text":"Joana: It's been crazy. Pretty much. I cried. I remember that my mom went\n   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really\n   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when\n   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I\n   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I\n   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was\n   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of\n   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,\n   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit\n   down. She didn't ask, \"How are you doing? How is school?\" Anything. \"Do you\n   have problems? Are you having trouble?\" I mean, nothing.\n \n \n   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?\n \n \n   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,\n   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just\n   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she\n   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and\n   she actually did. So, it was basically that.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was\n   because you didn't spend your first few years together?\n \n \n   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of\n   see the way she treats my brother and my sister\u2014she had them since they\n   were born\u2014every year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't\n   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was\n   really difficult for me.\n \n \n  "
