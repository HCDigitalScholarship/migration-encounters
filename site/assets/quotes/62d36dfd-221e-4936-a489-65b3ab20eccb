  "text":"Ben: And then after dad got better and went back to work, I still\n stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to\n go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED\n program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I\n just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college\n courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on\n them!\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: I thought it was too, but I still miss the graduation experience\n and all that. I missed out on that, but regardless, I kept going and I just\n went mainly into construction, stayed with drywall and did really well.\n When I married Bena, I started a business of my own and it struggled at\n first, but then I was persistent and everything just, it just changed from\n one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like\n working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And\n then finally, poof and from there everything changed.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, when you were in high school, did you feel like just any other\n American kid?\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes, I felt normal, I had a lot of friends and our\n high school,"
