  "text":"Ana: Integrating into Mexican society at first for me was inexistent in a\n way. To be honest, for me, my experience was just very negative. I didn't\n want to be here. So the whole first year of my stay, one was focusing on my\n health. That's all I basically did for a whole year. Two was basically just\n cry every single day. And three was question when I was going to go back.\n It wasn't a matter of \u201cI'm going to stay in Mexico.\u201d It wasn't until it\n was. So, it was hard, but... And the long term or in the long run, it's\n actually been pretty good.\n      \n      \n"
