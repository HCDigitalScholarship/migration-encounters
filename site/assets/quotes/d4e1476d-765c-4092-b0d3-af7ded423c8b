We didn't have a visa, we didn't have\n   anything.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You had to have papers like that in order to visit a family member?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, in detention center. Or you would also be detained. So, we\n   lived for about eleven months before he got physically deported back to\n   Mexico.\n \n \n   Lizzy: That's a long time to be kind of waiting, not knowing.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. I didn't even go back to school at that point. I was in high\n   school and my high school got raided a couple of times.\n \n \n  "
