  "text":"Anne: So how did school compare to the schooling that you'd had in Mexico?\n \n \n   Laura: It was actually better, the education. I afraid to tell this, but\n   the education is better in America than in Mexico. We have a lot of sports,\n   we have the art classes, and in Mexico we didn't have any of those. We only\n   have Spanish and math, and that's it. [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
