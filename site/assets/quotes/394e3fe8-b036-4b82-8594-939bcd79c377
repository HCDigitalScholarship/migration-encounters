But then after a\n   while you get used to it, and get the hang of it, started making friends\n   and stuff.\n \n \n   Isabel: Did you take ESL classes?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah, I did.\n \n \n   Isabel: What were those like?\n \n \n   Pablo: They were boring.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Pablo: But they were cool because we were all Hispanic people, so it felt\n   good, than just being with a bunch of Americans. They didn't speak English\n   that well, so it was better to be with our ESL tea"
