  "text":"As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie\n detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to\n get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, \"Hey, well, you\n failed your lie detector test.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Well, look,\n out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.\n You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't\n supposed to be doing it.\" He's like, \"So you're going to have to go before\n the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going\n to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and\n then...\n      \n      \n Anne: How old were you?\n      \n      \n Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering\n me five years, and I was like...\n      \n      \n Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?\n      \n      \n Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.\n      \n      \n Anne: It's sort of in jail.\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards\n are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...\n      \n      \n"
