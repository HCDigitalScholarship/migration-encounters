  "text":"Anita: What does home mean to you?\n \n \n   Melani: Home means ... at this point I don't even know what home means\n   [Chuckles], because I think sometimes maybe back home because I know that's\n   where I was raised and that's where I know people and that's where I feel\n   like it's my land. It's like everything's mine because I've been there my\n   whole life.\n \n \n   But I don't even feel accepted there because since my state is seventy-five\n   percent white, I would always get discriminated against for being Hispanic\n   or always the question would be, \"Are you legal or are you illegal?\" And I\n   would be like \"I'm legal,\" but I never felt a part of the society\n   completely because I would be illegal. And now that you say, \"What's home?\"\n   I really don't know what's home because I don't feel at home here or I\n   don't feel at home there and I don't feel at home in Arkansas because I\n   don't have citizenship [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n  "
