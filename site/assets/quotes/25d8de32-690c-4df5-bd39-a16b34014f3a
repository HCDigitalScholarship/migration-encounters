  "text":"Because I was searching for any type of programs that we can go to\n   the US, but as we know, they're always requiring not living in the US\n   before. They also require a visa, which is impossible to get in Mexico.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Impossible. Yep.\n \n \n   Frank: It's really impossible because you need to, why I tell you this\n   because I also try to get visa. You need to give a banking account with\n   more than 50,000 Pesos. Also, that's just for a week that you can only go\n   and that's as a tourist and you have to have a family member or a friend or\n   a relative that gives proof that you're going to that address. We know that\n   most people are scared of providing information to the government.\n \n \n  "
