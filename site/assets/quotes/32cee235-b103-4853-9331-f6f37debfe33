  "text":"Anne: What about the Mexican government? What do you think they can do?\n   What should they be doing to help returning migrants?\n \n \n   Luis: Well, first of all, just create something like ESL [English as a\n   Second Language], like Spanish as a second language. I was lucky, but a lot\n   of my peers, they can barely speak Spanish and they're\n   supposed to be Mexican. And everything is in Spanish here\u2014nothing is in\n   English. At least in the States a lot of documents are in Spanish or even\n   other languages. But in here, that's really hard. So, I would really\n   encourage the Mexican government to create some sort of program that\n   teaches deportees and immigrants Spanish as a second language. What else?\n   Some sort of way to speedy up bureaucratic processes to get your birth\n   certificate, IDs, and even bank accounts. ____ actually helps us out\n   getting bank accounts, so that's really great. I think they could do that.\n   What else they could do? Just exploit the skills that these people\n   have\u2014they speak English and they speak it incredibly well. That's just a\n   waste of talent right there, you know?\n \n \n  "
