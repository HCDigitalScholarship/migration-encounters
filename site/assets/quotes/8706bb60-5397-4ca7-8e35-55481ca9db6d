  "text":"Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he\n   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't\n   speak English. Some people will say to me, \"Why you don't teach him?\" I\n   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, \"Do your bed.\" He\n   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce it. Why?\n   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English\n   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.\n \n \n   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.\n \n \n   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some\n   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks\n   that way. I'm like, \"Mijo, why you talk that way?\" I don't mind it, because\n   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard\n   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he\n   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.\n \n \n  "
