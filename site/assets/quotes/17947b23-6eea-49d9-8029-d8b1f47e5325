  "text":"Erik: From either person. I mean, I just believe if you talk about\n   discriminations just talk about [inaudible 22:26], people with narrow mind.\n   It could be a white, it could be a black, it could be Hispanic. It could be\n   people from India. We are tribal beings. And if you do not belong to my\n   tribe, I going to feel afraid of you. I going to set back. And all those\n   fears is part of the discrimination. So of course you always experience it.\n   I was deported by a black police officer supporting Trump. [Both laugh].\n   You telling me I'm not facing discrimination? Of course, but you see the\n   same here in Mexico. People discriminate Indians, or not in Mexicans. You\n   know? Or they discriminate you if you don't have money, or they\n   discriminate you if you don't have a good job. You name it.\n \n \n  "
