  "text":"So I spent almost three weeks by myself drinking, smoking,\n   whatever the fuck I encountered over there. I started hanging out with\n   those kids that he didn't want me to hang out with. I started smoking stuff\n   that I didn't have to smoke. I started putting whatever shit I found into\n   my body and it was horrible. Whenever I was drunk, I thought about him more\n   and more, and I just got more and more depressed.\n \n \n  "
