  "text":"Claudia: What's been the hardest part back in Mexico?\n \n \n   Yosell: The hardest part here in Mexico is actually I'm trying to live here\n   with the economy that they have. One day transport is cheap, the next day\n   it goes up, and then it keeps going up, and you're just like, \"Oh.\" It's\n   just really hard to keep up with it.\n \n \n   Claudia: What have you been up to in this past year and a half that you've\n   been here?\n \n \n   Yosell: This past year I moved in with my girlfriend, so I've been here\n   ever since, and we met each other here. So I ended up moving out with her,\n   and I'm trying to do my university but it's kind of hard and stuff like\n   that.\n \n \n   Claudia: What are you trying to study?\n \n \n   Yosell: I was actually doing a graphic designs and stuff like that.\n \n \n   Claudia: Cool!\n \n \n   Yosell: That was always something I did like. And now in the States I\n   actually had an administration, so that was probably one of those two.\n \n \n   Claudia: Are you currently working or what are you doing?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah, currently I had a cousin that got me to work here at T-Tech,\n   so I guess that was it.\n \n \n   Claudia: Do you like T-Tech?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah, it\u2019s a pretty interesting place.\n \n \n   Claudia: In what ways?\n \n \n   Yosell: It kind of reminds me of the high school out in the States. That's\n   basically that's all I can say about it. [Chuckle]\n \n \n   Claudia: In what way does it remind you of a high school?\n \n \n   Yosell: With all the people in there, basically it's a high school. That's\n   how high school is out there. It just reminded me exactly like in\n   California high school.\n \n \n  "
