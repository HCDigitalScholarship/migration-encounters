  "text":"Jesus: Well, I was getting in trouble with the law, not really because I\n wanted to, but because I didn't have papers. I bought a car and stuff, and\n I would drive, and they would pull me over, and I wouldn't have a driver's\n license or insurance or none of that. So, I'd get a ticket, they'd get my\n car taken away, stuff like that.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So different things related to driving?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, it was mostly driving. They would pull me over a lot for that.\n Sometimes they'll let me go. I'd be like, \u201cThat's really cool,\u201d because I\n would just use the car to go to work and come back. I would even be dressed\n and everything and tell them, \"I'm just getting off work, just trying to\n get home. I ain't doing nothing bad,\" and they'd be like, \"All right, we'll\n let you go this one time,\" or whatever.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So sometimes they let you go, but sometimes it was a bigger deal?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, sometimes it'd be like, \u201cNo, can't do it.\u201d I was like,\n \u201cWhatever. Give me my fine and take my car away.\u201d Then all those tickets,\n and all that with the law, when the DREAM Act came out, I wasn't able to\n apply because of that, because I had a criminal record.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Criminal record, but just based on traffic violations?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Traffic violations, mostly.\n      \n      \n"
