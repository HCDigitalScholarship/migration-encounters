  "text":"Lizzy: Is there anything that, so kind of switching to the Mexico side now,\n   is there anything you wish Mexican people understood about families like\n   yours that went to the US and came back?\n \n \n   Laila: I would like them to understand that we don't have cash stashed\n   somewhere. It's not like we went to the States and we came back rich.\n   That's illogical to think. And just to have them be a little more\n   understanding of the kids that come back from the States. Personally, I\n   went through a lot of discrimination from my own people because I didn't\n   perfectly know or understand the language. So, I would like them to try to\n   ease on to those kinds of people that come back from the States. And don't\n   think that, oh you're made of cash or you're not Mexican because you don't\n   speak Spanish. I mean it's not that, it's that we're used to something\n   completely different. We went to school in the States, so you couldn't\n   speak Spanish in school because all of your teachers spoke English.\n   Everybody communicated in English so if you know the basics, but you don't\n   know more than that, just don't be mean to those people. It's not fair.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Just like how we hate it when people in the States, if they hear\n   someone speaking Spanish they tell them, \"Don't speak Spanish here, speak\n   English.\" It sounds like kind of that same kind of discrimination happens\n   here if you're speaking English.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. I have seen a lot of people make fun of other people for\n   speaking English, and it gets me very angry because it's like, okay so\n   you're on them because they speak English, what does that have to do with\n   anything? If they had the chance to learn another language, that's cool.\n   That's good for them, you know? But they hear other people speaking\n   English, or I've seen British people here going on tours and all that,\n   seeing the city, and other Mexican people see them, or hear them, they\n   start making fun of them. And it's like, why are you making fun of them?\n   There's no point. I have gotten into some conflicts with my cousins,\n   specifically, because they think it\u2019s funny for other people to speak\n   English when for me, it's a privilege to have been able to speak another\n   language other than Spanish. For me, it's an advantage. For my cousins,\n   it's a laughing matter, and it does get me angry because I have told them,\n   \"I mean, you wouldn't like to be in the States and speak your native\n   language and have someone make fun of you and tell you don't speak Spanish.\n   No. That's your native language, that's what you know.\" Don't make fun of\n   other people for that, it's pointless to just make fun of other people for\n   situations like that.\n \n \n  "
