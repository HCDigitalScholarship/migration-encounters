  "text":"Olimpya: But then, I met this guy who is my baby's dad. He was from the\n   best kids there were because you could find worse. He would be like, \"No,\n   go in your classes. Be good. You're a lady. Don't do this. Don't do that.\"\n   So I was like, \"Hey, he's protecting me.\" I found somebody to protect me,\n   to look after me. So I started listening to him, and I tried to finish\n   school, but then I got really sick. I had a weird sickness in my blood, and\n   I couldn't go to school no more.\n \n \n  "
