  "text":"Melani: Whenever I say I would like to be independent. I told my\n   grandparents, \"You know what, I'm really thankful for my stay here, but I\n   would like to grow independent.\"\n \n \n   In Arkansas, everybody leaves at 18. They go to study and they really never\n   go back. And I told my grandparents, \"Well that's how things happen back\n   home and that's how I've grown and known that you should live life.\u201d And\n   they said, \"Well, no. Here we do things differently. Here you stay until\n   you're married.\"\n \n \n   And they'll implement Catholicism really deep into you. They'll be like,\n   \"You need to pray to all the saints and stuff because if you're not with\n   God, then you don't know what family is.\" And I'm like, \"Well I think there\n   should be separation of state and religion, and family and religion,\n   because it's two different things. You can't mix things like that\n   together.\u201d\n \n \n  "
