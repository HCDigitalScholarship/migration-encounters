  "text":"Mike: My dad was already in the States. But a couple of years passed after\n   we crossed the border, my mom and my dad didn't get along, and my dad was\n   really controlling and abusive. So my mom ran away and took us to Los\n   Angeles to live with my uncle. And, at that time, my dad didn't know where\n   we were, because my mom was really scared.\n \n \n  "
