  "text":"Donovan: Give it a lot of pride. And everybody who saw me dance, even the\n   teacher said, I poured all my heart into it. I feel like it was my calling.\n   A lot of people followed me. Everybody's told me I don't see it, but they\n   always tell me I tend to be the leader and I tend to be the alpha wolf. I\n   pour everybody with me. If I do something bad, everybody does the bad stuff\n   with me. Or if I do something good, everybody's with me. I'm able to make a\n   lot of friends and it just always, always be the first ones to say\n   something, to scream something, or to throw the first rock.\n \n \n  "
