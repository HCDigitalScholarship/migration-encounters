  "text":"Ivan: Yes. Actually, I had a partner and I would work from different\n   companies, because the photography industry for Hispanics in North Carolina\n   started growing so much. First small business, they went to big companies.\n   They'll hire photographers and I would work some side jobs for companies.\n   So I was doing well. I was doing pretty well back then.\n \n"
