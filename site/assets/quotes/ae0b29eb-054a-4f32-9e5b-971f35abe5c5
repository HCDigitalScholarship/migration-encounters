And when I got here it's like, no\n paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a\n driver's license, getting my voter registration\u2014which is the main source of\n ID here\u2014the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.\n And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I\n needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It\n took me a few months.\n      \n      \n"
