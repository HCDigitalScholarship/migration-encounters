  "text":"Anita: So how did kids separate into rival gangs?\n \n \n   Ruben: There was actually a group of 15 kids. We all grew up together.\n   First through sixth grade we all went to Elementary. We all went to the\n   same middle school, but by the time we hit middle school, we happened to\n   come from different neighborhoods in the same area in the southeast of LA\n   and in one side we were all enemies, but in the other side we try to keep\n   that friendship of where we can have little reunions and no think about\n   what was happening in the streets. And no think about how a part of my\n   neighborhood went and killed one of them. That was off for that little\n   meeting. It was just us, see how we were doing. Our kids, our wives. Have\n   some type of good time and memories from when we were in first, second,\n   third, whatever you can remember. We'll bring it up and laugh, have a\n   little picnic, but leave all those problems to the side. We'll never bring\n   them there.\n \n \n  "
