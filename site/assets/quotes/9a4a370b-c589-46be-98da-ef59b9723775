  "text":"Many: Well, after I see my kids, I'm going to try to get me a place where I\n   can take my kids every time when they want to come and visit. I know that I\n   have opportunities because I'm Mexican. Mexico, they give me an opportunity\n   to give me a house after, I think one year or two years, working with a\n   social security number. They gave me a chance to get a house. I have to pay\n   for the rest of my life, but I mean, it's good. If I can get a house, I\n   think it's a pretty good option for me to see my kids again.\n \n \n  "
