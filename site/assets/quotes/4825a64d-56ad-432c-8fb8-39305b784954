I grew up fairly wealthy in Mexico. I had a big, big\n   house. I had two German Shepherds that ran around everywhere. I had a\n   playroom, my own room. I had a great childhood. I went to private school.\n   It was amazing, so to go from that ... My dad and I were inseparable. I\n   have extremely fond memories as a child, and I remember I didn't want to go\n   to my own room. I would sleep on top of my father. That was my place. They\n   had to buy a king-sized bed because I would not leave my father's side. I\n   would lay and sleep on my dad's chest always. Always, always, always,\n   always, always, so it was extremely difficult to leave my dad behind the\n   most. My dad was my world back then. But my dad, my friends, school\u2014school\n   was great, I loved school [Chuckles]\u2014I had to leave it all behind.\n \n \n  "
