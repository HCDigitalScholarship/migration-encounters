  "text":"Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting\n it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were\n trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,\n something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea\n of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time\n or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting\n immigration.\n      \n      \n"
