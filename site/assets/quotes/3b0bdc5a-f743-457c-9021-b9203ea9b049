  "text":"Miguel: I worked in Teletech, just call centers, in general. Call centers,\n   in general. I actually wrote a lot of poetry working in call centers about\n   the mechanization of human life. Because in North Carolina it was so nice \u2026\n   It wasn't so urbanized. When I was working in call centers, I was\n   developing ideas about mechanization of human life. I even have a poem.\n   Maybe I can tell you later on.\n \n <",
