  "text":"Ruben: When was this, in '90... I was in between what, 11 and 12? And it\n   was an experience, not expected, but as a kid, you see too much violence,\n   and cops hitting people, helicopters putting everything on live on TV. It\n   was scary. It was like the whole world was just like going crazy. And at\n   the time being, there were only a few lettings up in that area. African\n   American people were actually just going crazy, opening the stores,\n   stealing stuff, and being really violent because you actually, the next day\n   you can find safety bags from the banks and that's kind of heavy stuff. It\n   was an experience that actually left a shock for like maybe nine months, it\n   took us to recover from that. We didn't want to go to school. We thought\n   they were going to hit us.\n \n \n  "
