  "text":"Olimpya: Well, the schools, they're better. They teach you more things.\n   They actually teach them. That's what I used to like about the States. The\n   activities. Here, it's really hard for a single mom or a mom to take your\n   kids to any activity because the ones that are for free, they're really\n   bad, and whenever you have to pay, it's hard to access even if you don't\n   have to pay that much. The ones that are really good, it's not affordable\n   for middle-class families. So it makes you get mad. Well, it makes me get\n   mad because I'm like, \"Hey, he needs to have access to this. He's a really\n   intelligent kid, and I'm not giving him the tools to grow, and to learn,\n   and do everything he's going to be able to.\" Yeah, it's hard.\n \n \n  "
