I\n   guess that's what sent me down to depression because it was like 9th grade,\n   you transition from middle school to 9th, it's a big change and then you\n   find out this. And obviously, yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So finding out about being undocumented kind of made everything\n   worse?\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah. Yeah, I guess. It just added onto it.\n \n \n  "
