  "text":"Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated\n   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel\n   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, \"You know what?\n   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of\n   us.\" But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or\n   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're\n   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where\n   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and\n   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.\n \n \n   Anita: Did you fight?\n \n \n   Luisa: My mom? No.\n \n \n   Anita: You just accepted it?\n \n \n   Luisa: [Pause] Yes and no. It took me a while. I was even going to marry my\n   best friend, E___. I was like, \"Let's get married. Let's get married.\" He\n   was my best friend, but he didn't know why I wanted to get married\n   [Laughs]. In my mind, I was like, \"Fuck it. Let's do this. I'll get papers\n   and I'll continue my education. That's fine. Once we're married, he's stuck\n   with me. I'll tell him then.\u201d [Pause] I even thought about that. I was\n   getting extremely desperate, but\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: How did E___ think? What did he think?\n \n \n   Luisa: When I told him I was moving to Mexico, he offered to marry me too\n   so I would stay behind. I think he kind of knew at that point. I think E___\n   knew. He wasn't a stupid guy. He called my mom mommy. He wasn't stupid.\n \n \n  "
