  "text":"Rodrigo: Yeah. I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45\n   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up\n   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have\n   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I\n   could show any proof. I was honest with him. \"No, I'm not.\" So, he right\n   away called Border Patrol.\n \n \n   Anita: Really?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: What year is this?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002? But from then, I already had a daughter\n   right there. I was married.\n \n \n   Anita: You were married to a Mexican?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: To a Chicana.\n \n \n   Anita: You didn't get residency?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: That's another story. [laughs]. No, from there I got deported.\n   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will\n   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,\n   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court\n   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave\n   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.\n   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my\n   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.\n \n \n   Anita: What about your wife?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could\n   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad\n   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over\n   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.\n   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back\n   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she\n   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers\n   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.\n \n \n  "
