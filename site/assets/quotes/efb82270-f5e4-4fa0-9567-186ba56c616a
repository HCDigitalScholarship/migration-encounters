  "text":"Olimpya: My mom used to have a lot of domestic violence problems with my\n   dad. So normally, we would be leaving the house, and come back, and come\n   and go. But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico\n   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my\n   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one\n   day, my mom said, \"You know what? We're leaving.\" So we grabbed a couple of\n   clothes, shoes, and we left.\n \n \n  "
