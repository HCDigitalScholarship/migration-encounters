  "text":"There's a lot of people, and this was\n   surprising too to us, talked about discrimination between Mexicans, illegal\n   Mexicans, and Chicanos. Did you experience that?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do\n   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but\n   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were\n   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for\n   my peers.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Because you were a city dude?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yeah, well, the area where I lived wasn't a big city. It was like _______.\n   It wasn't super big, but it wasn't small.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   You said you weren't like people from the provinces, so you were considered\n   Chicano?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I\n   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang\n   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they\n   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other\n   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the\n   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,\n   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice\n   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a\n   trampoline, we had a swing. I guess that's why they were working all day so\n   they could provide us with that type of lifestyle. I didn't really feel\n   that personally, but I do remember other people discriminating. I don't\n   want to say for lower class people, they did. They did get that.\n \n \n  "
