There's a\n   lot of stuff I wish I could have done different, but\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: Do your little sisters, your little brothers, would you say their\n   experiences were very different than yours, because of your sacrifices? Or\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: Yes. Yes. A lot of them. A lot of things. If we didn't do, they\n   probably would have had to do, because if it wasn't me, it would've been\n   the next one. And they did have to go through that stuff too, in a way,\n   because sometimes I couldn't do it, because I'd be in school doing\n   something really, really important. My mom would be like, \"No, just stay in\n   school. Do this. Do that.\"\n \n \n   Mike: So it's like she would take my other little brothers. But somebody\n   always had to watch my little sisters. Yeah, it was just we took turns and\n   stuff, but I feel like everybody felt it. Everybody got a chance to go\n   through that stuff even if they didn't want to [Chuckle].\n \n \n  "
