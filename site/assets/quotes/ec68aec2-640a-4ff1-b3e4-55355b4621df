  "text":"Olimpya: [Chuckle]. It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in\n   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to\n   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I\n   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I\n   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,\n   the first thing they said was, \"Hey, you're dark.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\n   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?\" They're like, \"No, we need to buy\n   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...\" I was like, \"Hey, I\n   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?\n   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].\" So, it kind of\n   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but\n   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody\n   said something about my skin color before\u2014\n \n \n  "
