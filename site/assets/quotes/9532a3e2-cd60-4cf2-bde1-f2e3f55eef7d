  "text":"I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a\n   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, \"Hey, man, don't take his food.\n   That's all he got to eat.\" They were like, \"So, what, are you going to\n   defend them now?\" I'm like, \"I'm just defending a person. He's just like\n   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.\" But they got onto me\n   and they said, \"Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,\n   we're more.\" I said, \"Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,\" just for being\n   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to\n   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,\n   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.\n   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I\n   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.\n \n \n  "
