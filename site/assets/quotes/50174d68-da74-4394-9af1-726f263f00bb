  "text":"Rodolfo: I don't want to say I feel like American. Spiritually, me myself,\n   as an individual, I feel like now that I've been in Mexico and been living\n   the real life of a real life Mexican\u2014because man, it's hard out here, you\n   know?\u2014I feel like if I say I'm American, I feel like I'm betraying who I\n   am. Because I have American\u2026 Yes, I'm from... Because even then I can't\n   even say I'm American cause I'm not from there, that's why I'm here, right?\n   But the way I feel, yeah, I guess I am what they call me here, el gabacho,\n   the American, the white boy. Do I feel it? I feel it only because I miss my\n   home and that's what I want to be in order to be okay over there. I mean,\n   if that's what I have to be in order to be okay over there and then, okay,\n   yeah, I'm American.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: But when I'm amongst individuals, Mexicans here and everything, my\n   own people, I'm a Mexican. It still takes me a little while for me to be\n   able to really integrate myself because to this point, to this day, I still\n   have trouble expressing myself 100% in Spanish. I always try to better my\n   Spanish, but it gets to the point where sometimes I can't fully express the\n   way I feel at times.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: So, I speak in English but then you can't understand me in English\n   because you speak all Spanish. So, those are the times when I really truly\n   do feel American more than I feel Mexican. Because if I can't voice and\n   express my true feelings in my native tongue then that's\u2014my native tongue\n   is English.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: So, you know what? Now that you do mention it, yeah, I feel more\n   American now than I do Mexican and it's kind of mixed feelings. Because I'm\n   trying to forget everything that I was over, that was going on over there,\n   that I lived over there. But it's hard because I want to go back, I want to\n   be able to punch in at Cheesecake Factory, and I want to be able to come\n   home and just be with my family. But yeah, I do feel more American than I\n   do Mexican and I'm not ashamed to say that's who I am. Short of being born\n   over there, I'm from over there.\n \n \n  "
