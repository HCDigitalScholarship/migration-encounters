  "text":"Over here, you speak Spanish. Here, the system of education for\n   English is very bad. It's very bad. I always try to hear music in English,\n   and read books, and stuff like that, and watch movies in English because if\n   you don't practice it, you'll forget it. You'll forget it. Once you're\n   older, it is very difficult or is more difficult to learn a language than\n   when you were little. Getting back here was [Pow sound].\n \n \n   Carlos: They even thought it would be better if I started middle school,\n   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.\n   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects\n   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English\n   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were\n   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I\n   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I\n   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,\n   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,\n   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used\n   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.\n   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like\n   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into\n   Spanish, so I didn't really have a hard time. I spent two years in those\n   classes. After that, I'm normal. I can talk Spanish normally and all that\n   stuff.\n \n \n  "
