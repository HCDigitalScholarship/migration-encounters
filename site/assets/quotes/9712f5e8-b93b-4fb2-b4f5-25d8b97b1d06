  "text":"Sylent:\n \n \n   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different\n   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have\n   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding\n   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I\n   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very\n   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was\n   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own\n   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've\n   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there\n   was a class called ESL.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Yeah.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was\n   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it\n   could be you know, an alien. I said, \"Yes, we are aliens. We're from a\n   different planet called Mexico.\" I guess that's how it started and just\n   people picking on us that we're illegal, \"Go back to your country,\" and\n   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, \"Yes,\n   we are illegal. So what?\" That's how it started.\n \n \n  "
