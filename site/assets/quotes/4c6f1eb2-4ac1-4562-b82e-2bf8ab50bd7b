That's what I could say.\n \n \n   Claudia: Did you join anyone when you were over there?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah. I got jumped in, 15,16, with a family kind of thing when\n   they're out there. That was basically not a really big choice for me. All\n   the family was in there, so that's all I could say on that.\n \n \n   Claudia: How was that?\n \n \n   Yosell: Basically, there's a very big process into it, which is kind of, I\n   don\u2019t know. Probably we shouldn't talk about it too much.\n \n \n  "
