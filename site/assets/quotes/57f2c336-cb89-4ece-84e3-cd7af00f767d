  "text":"Zayuri: Yeah. This one is actually quite funny to explain because my\n   father, he has Lupita written out on his arm in this gaudy Cholo letters.\n   My father, he also has tattoos, but they're like the green type you see,\n   the kinds of ones that you see on people who just got out of prison. I have\n   asked him, \"Have you ever been to prison?\" And he's like, \"No.\" I was like,\n   \"Where do you got those tattoos?\" \"In the studio.\" They don't look like\n   studio tattoos to me. They look green, green and all bloated.\n \n \n   Zayuri: But he has Lupita in this arm, and I always told my mom, \"When I'm\n   older, I am going to get your name. I am going to get something, something\n   related to you.\" She was like, \"No, don't do that.\" She doesn't like\n   tattoos. She even cried when my father got that because she was really\n   upset about it. She was like, \"Why did you did that?\" So, it was like,\n   \"Okay, I can't copy my dad's tattoo. I'm not that unoriginal.\" I was like,\n   \"I don't want to get the heart shape.\"\n \n \n  "
