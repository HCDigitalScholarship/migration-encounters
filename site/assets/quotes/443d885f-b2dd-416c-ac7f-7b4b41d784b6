  "text":"Anne: So, you were playing this game with the tapes\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: With the tapes and stuff and then later we started elementary\n school and then once I started elementary school, it changed. Well my\n mother had a rule, she goes, \"No English inside of the house.\u201d Before, it\u2019s\n \u201cSpeak English, speak English,\u201d but once we started school, she goes, \"I\n don't want you all speaking English here inside the house\u201d to me and my\n brother. And we used to think that\u2019s because she didn't understand, but it\n was because she wanted us to practice the Spanish.\n      \n      \n Ben: And when I would get home from school when I was going to\n kindergarten\u2014my brother would get out an hour later\u2014I would get home and my\n mother would give me these little comic magazines, Mexican comic magazines,\n and she'd have me read them. And then she would make me write letters to my\n grandmother. So that's how I was able to learn a little bit of, keep the\n Spanish and English. But English I did, I went through elementary, middle\n school, went to tenth grade in high school, then I dropped out of high\n school to go help my father. He started a small construction business, but\n then he got sick and he was hospitalized for three months.\n      \n      \n"
