  "text":"Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back\n   here?\n \n \n   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over\n   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that\u2014well they found drugs\n   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know\n   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.\n   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give\n   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a\n   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they\n   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.\n \n \n   Anita: So, they charged you instead of the person who had the drugs?\n \n \n   Ivan: Yes. Yes, that's true.\n \n \n   Anita: Why'd they do that?\n \n \n   Ivan: I don't know, but they did. They didn't want to take the charge. But\n   I mean, I was just with them because I was going to Walmart to do a return\n   and they stopped us in a traffic stop and they blamed it all on me. I was\n   trying to fight my case, but it was taking too long. I was getting too\n   stressed out being inside in jail so I just signed the papers. I just\n   wanted to get out, so I just took the charge.\n \n \n  "
