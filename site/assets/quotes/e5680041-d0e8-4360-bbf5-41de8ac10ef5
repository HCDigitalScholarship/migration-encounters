  "text":"Luis: Exactly. So yeah, they tell me that, my English is proficient enough\n   to go to regular school, but my brother and my uncle needs to go to that\n   specific high school because they have classes for, they have ESL.\n \n \n   Anne: ESL?\n \n \n   Luis: [Affirmative noise]. They went to that school and I will go to this\n   other high school called ____, but a bus would take them to\n   ____, in another district. And I wish I would've known that\n   it was easier over there because the immigrant community is bigger, right?\n   So you have more people to relate to because the one I was going to, no one\n   spoke Spanish and the people that knew how to speak Spanish did not want to\n   speak Spanish. It was like a process of I'm not going to let them know that\n   I know Spanish. I'm not actually American. And that was very few. I mean\n   people were very nice. I'm not going to deny that, but at the same time I\n   couldn't relate to anybody. I became a loner of some sort and I was just\n   like isolated. Because I was at first, since I didn't talk, I was really\n   introverted, but then like I blossomed. When I was in middle school and I\n   was like really extroverted. But then with this change I became introverted\n   again. So I would just mind my own business and I liked to play basketball a\n   lot. So I will play basketball. I will do handstands. I liked to be very\n   physical at the moment. So I would just train you know? It was funny\n   because for some reason people thought that I was really mysterious like, \u201cThat\n   dude must be a Ninja or something. He's really mysterious. He's just like\n   doing flips and stuff.\u201d I was really athletic at that moment. Not anymore.\n \n \n  "
