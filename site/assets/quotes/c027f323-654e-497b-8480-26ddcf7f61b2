  "text":"Luis: Okay. Well so, the first time, when I was a kid and I didn't even\n   know that I wasn't really American. So, I just grew up normally. My uncle's\n   partner at the moment was really nice\u2014she was American\u2014and she was an\n   incredible person. She was really caring. So, she would take care of us and\n   we would just watch TV, Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles, Power Rangers. And to\n   me language was just whatever. So we just learned naturally English and\n   Spanish. I just thought it was the same language, because we were speaking \n   both back and forth at my house. So yeah, it wasn't hard at all. That's how I\n   learned English. And in terms of like really fitting in, I was so little\n   that I don't really remember exactly. But I mean they were good\n   times. I didn't work, I didn't go to school, I was just watching\n   TV.\n \n \n  "
