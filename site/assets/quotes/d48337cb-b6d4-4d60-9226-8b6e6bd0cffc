  "text":"Mike: I was almost there, and my AIMS... Everything I passed it except for\n   the math. I passed all my AIMS exams. You know the test that you take at\n   the end of the year, Stanford or AIMS or whatever they are?\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah.\n \n \n   Mike: I passed all of them except for my math. My senior year I actually\n   passed it, but I didn't graduate. I just would go to school, literally eat\n   lunch, just get out. It got boring for me and I was really good. I should\n   have never started.\n \n \n   Mike: I remember I was taking Japanese, I was taking English, social\n   studies, a bunch of extra stuff just to try to advance my knowledge and\n   stuff, but I don't know. Once you don't get that motivation and wants to\n   stop, it sucks.\n \n \n  "
