  "text":"Luis: He was seventy-two when he got the cancer diagnosis. It was just, I\n   don't know, I just feel so much regret for the last time that I saw him. I\n   told him that I fucking hated him: \"I hate your fucking guts because you\n   kept on smoking and you knew that it was bad for you, but you kept on doing\n   it. You didn't give a shit about me because you knew that I was\u2026 Now you\n   know that I'm going to be alone and you didn't give a fuck. So, you kept\n   doing it, so fuck you man.\" And that's the last thing that I told him. I\n   told him to fuck himself.\n \n \n   Luis: That's my biggest regret because he was my friend more than my dad.\n   He was my friend. He was my best friend so I don't know, it's just, that's\n   the last thing that I told him. And I was out with a few friends on my\n   house. He was alone, of course, and we were drinking. I knew that I\n   shouldn't be drinking but, you know, stupid things that kids do and stuff\n   like that. So one of my pals came back and he said, \"Hey man, so my mom\n   told me that your pa is going to die tonight. That\u2019s what the doctor told\n   me.\u201d So I just, I didn't go to the hospital. I didn't want to go. I didn't\n   want to see him like that.\n \n \n  "
