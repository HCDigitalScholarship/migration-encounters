  "text":"Pablo: No, I think that's about it. It is pretty hard. And once you get\n   deported, especially when you get deported, when you come by your own\n   decision, you know, you're good. But when you get deported and you just get\n   arrested with no money in your pocket and then they let you out like that.\n   And it is pretty hard because Mexico is dangerous. There's a lot of things\n   that can happen to you and stuff. I'm glad I made it. I'm glad I'm here\n   now. I'm glad I got a job. I'm not into that much trouble anymore. I have\n   my kid.\n \n \n  "
