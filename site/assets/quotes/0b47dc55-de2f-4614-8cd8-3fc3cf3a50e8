  "text":"Rodolfo: Yeah, I guess it's one of those things where you think it's never\n   really gonna affect you, until you're in the back of the DHS, the\n   Department of Homeland Security, van. You're next to a whole bunch of\n   people you never met, and they're also in the same position. Some don't\n   even speak English. You don't really understand how immediately it can\n   affect you until it affects you. I never thought it would affect me. Okay,\n   well I mean, I'm working, I'm going to school\u2014I'm in high school\u2014I'm doing\n   this, this and that. Some of my friends who are students already dropped\n   out. Did everything, they\u2019ve already gone to prison and back and\n   everything, and they haven't even hit their 21st birthday.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And I'm still good, I'm still good. I may not be a straight A\n   student or anything, but hey man, I'm still here! Why can't I have the same\n   privilege as you all do? Why can't I get my license? You know how happy I\n   was when I got my license here, damn. I love to drive, that's one of my\n   passions. Always, always, always I love to drive. I couldn't get my license\n   over there. I remember even in high school in drivers ed, I knew what the\n   answer was, but I asked my mom, \u201cHey mom, can I apply for drivers ed, so I\n   can get my license? \u201cShe was like, \"You know you can't get your license.\"\n   Again, one of the primary things, I\u2019m like damn, I'm just not gonna be able\n   to drive all my life? Or if I do drive and I get pulled over\u2014as a matter of\n   fact, that's the reason why I got deported, driving without a valid drivers\n   license.\n \n \n  "
