A lot of people wish that they had a job. Would kill to just get\n   up early and just get that paycheck. I know a lot of families that they\n   have to go through the most, but they still do it, because they have to.\n   They have no choice. And it's way better than here. And I didn't understand\n   that until now.\n \n \n  "
