  "text":"Joana: No, I don't think there is. I think I've said enough. I don't think\n   anyone should go through that. It's pain, it's painful. You don't know how\n   many nights I've fallen asleep crying just thinking about everything that\n   someone could say to you or things that they have said to me. You don't\n   know how much your words can hurt a person. How much just a simple word\n   could end their life. A lot of people have committed suicide because of\n   that, because they couldn't bear with everything that's going on. A lot of\n   people have lost their lives. I don't think it's fair. No one should have\n   to be afraid of going outside or going to work. You're just going to work.\n   You're not doing anything bad. You're not going against the law. I mean,\n   you're working. You're trying. As a student, you try every day. Other kids\n   do bully you if they find out that you're not a U.S. citizen. They'll call\n   you names. They'll pick on you. Some have been kicked, punched, etc. That's\n   not what a kid should go through, especially not if you're really young. A\n   lot of five-year-olds go through that. Imagine a kid going through that. An\n   innocent child that shouldn't be put through that.\n \n \n  "
