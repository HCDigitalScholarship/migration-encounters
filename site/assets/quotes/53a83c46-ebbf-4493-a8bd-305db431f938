  "text":"Ivan: This was North Carolina. And then let's say 30% it was Caucasians.\n   And then like the other 10%, it was just Mexicans, some Asians, Middle\n   Eastern. So we were like a minority when I first started. And I had a hard\n   time making friends because the only people that I would get along and\n   because of the language, it was Latin American people. But the Mexicans in\n   my school, they're all from the countryside and I was from the city. And\n   they think so differently. And just the fact that I like rock music, they\n   didn't like me. Yeah. My own people. I was like, what? And I would not be\n   able to talk to some other people, because I didn't know the language. So I\n   was alone all the time.\n \n"
