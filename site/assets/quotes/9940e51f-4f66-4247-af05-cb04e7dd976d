  "text":"Anita: Did you feel American?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. Most of the time. Most of the time I would just feel like a\n   white kid. But I knew, of course, that my pa was Mexican. I knew that my\n   grandma was Mexican. I knew where they came from and I knew they're\u2026 I like\n   to be in touch with my traditions, some traditions. We used to celebrate\n   D\u00eda de la Independencia, the sixteenth of September. We always tune in the\n   internet, whatever the hell they were doing in el Z\u00f3calo or stuff like\n   that. So yeah, it was pretty good. I was in touch with some traditions.\n   Mostly I didn't do any kind of American traditions like Thanksgiving or\n   Christmas.\n \n \n   Anita: You didn't?\n \n \n   Luis: No, I didn't. No, I still don't know what the hell is wrong with\n   Thanksgiving and stuff like that. Never liked turkey anyway. So yeah, it\n   was good and I never suffered any kind of stuff.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you didn't have friends who invited you over For Thanksgiving.\n \n \n   Luis: There was one time. ____ he invited me over for Thanksgiving, but my\n   pa was like, \"I don't want you getting used to that kind of stuff because\n   we're not going to celebrate it.\" I was like, \"Okay.\" So yeah, I just went\n   over and said hi and ate a little bit of coleslaw and that\u2019s it. I just\n   went out. Never liked coleslaw anyway. So, it was good. It was cool. So\n   that was my best experience, and the bad experiences were just mostly, just\n   hearing what was wrong with my role in the world, or where was I standing\n   as far as a citizenship would go. I don't know how to explain that. I would\n   say that the worst part of living in the United States was knowing that I\n   would never be a full American. Knowing that I was not a part of America.\n   Well, America as a continent, it's a different thing. Knowing that I was\n   never going to be a USA citizen. Knowing that most people hate foreigners.\n   Most people just hate people from another country.\n \n \n  "
