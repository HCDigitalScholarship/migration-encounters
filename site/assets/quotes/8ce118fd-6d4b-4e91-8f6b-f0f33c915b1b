  "text":"Claudia: I see. Did you like school? What did you get up to in the States?\n \n \n   Yosell: In the States I finished my high school out there, and I was\n   actually studying a little bit of college, but after the dumb Trump kind of\n   thing came in place, I was just like, \"Eh.\" And my mom had cancer at the\n   time\u2014she was fighting her cancer. So I ended up just saying, \"I'm going\n   back out to Mexico to live this time and actually live out here.\" I ended\n   up just coming back, and just forgetting about college over there, and came\n   back here to Mexico to actually live. And of course I was actually helping\n   my mom with the cancer thing.\n \n \n   Claudia: What did you do in the States? What did you like to do for fun?\n \n \n   Yosell: Out in the States?\n \n \n   Claudia: Yeah.\n \n \n   Yosell: I actually had a sponsor for snowboarding and surfing.\n \n \n   Claudia: Holy shit, that's awesome.\n \n \n   Yosell: That's basically what I did. I just got paid to do that. And when I\n   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would\n   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and\n   that's it, basically.\n \n \n   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?\n \n \n   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to\n   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free\n   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there\n   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know\n   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I\n   don't know, it was always really into water.\n \n \n   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually\n   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of\n   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so\n   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,\n   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,\n   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.\n \n \n   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you\n   competed?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come\n   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of\n   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.\n \n \n   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?\n \n \n   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I\n   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor\u2014which his name\n   was called Jones, he was my manager out there\u2014and I told him, \"Hey, you\n   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.\" And I got to say thanks and that's it.\n   And he actually tried\u2014when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a\n   lot\u2014he's telling me, \"Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or\n   something.\" I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of\n   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was\n   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive\n   out here to do something. You can't really do much.\n \n \n  "
