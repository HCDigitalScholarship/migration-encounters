  "text":"Luis: So, we got here and my uncle took us to this high school, that was\n   called ____. That wasn't the nearest high school to our\n   house. But this high school had specific programs tailored to immigrants.\n \n \n   Anne: Okay.\n \n \n   Luis: So we took a test, an English proficiency test. And it was my\n   brother, me and my uncle, because my uncle is my age. And so he's like a\n   brother. So we took the exam and it was, a number out of five. Right? So my\n   uncle gets one out of five, my brother gets two out of five and I get four\n   out of five. So I mean, I guess I did good or like they congratulated me,\n   but afterwards I realized that I should have done worse, but anyway.\n \n \n  "
