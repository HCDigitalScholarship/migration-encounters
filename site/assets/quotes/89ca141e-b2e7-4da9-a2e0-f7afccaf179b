  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n     Final question, did you have American friends too?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     No. Well, yes. A few of them, but I was in middle school. After high\n     school, not many. It was all mixed up. Americans actually started moving\n     when the Chicano movement was there, they started moving. High school I\n     didn't have that much American friends.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Who were your friends?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Mexicans and black people. A lot of black people. I met a lot of black\n     people.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     They accepted you?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     They had to.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     What do you mean?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     It was very tough because they wanted us to stick with them as, I don't\n     know. Schools are like\u2013 they do have certain stuff going on with gang\n     related things and country stuff, and they wanted us to be part of them.\n     Whenever an American would say something or do something, we're together,\n     but we actually said, \"No.\" We're good friends. But that's it.\n \n \n    "
