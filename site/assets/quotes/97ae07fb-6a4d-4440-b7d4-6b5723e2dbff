  "text":"Carlos: It's a long story. I had some friends\u2014they were African Americans,\n   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long\n   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad\n   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a\n   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,\n   though. Not like the one they have here, right?\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah, cool.\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,\n   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just\n   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go\n   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went\n   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they\n   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There\n   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think\n   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.\n \n \n   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them\n   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't\n   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so\n   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.\n \n \n   Anne: You were 15?\n \n \n   Carlos: 15.\n \n \n   Anne: Just a child.\n \n \n   Carlos: Yeah. Teenagers. Brand new teenager.\n \n \n   Anne: Were you part of a gang?\n \n \n   Carlos: No, but they were, but I didn't know that. After, they told me. The\n   one that I stuck with, he actually told me, \"Hey, you know what? After they\n   snitch\"\u2014and he knew\u2014he was like, \"Hey, you know what? You're about to get\n   in trouble. We're in a gang.\" I really don't remember the name of the gang.\n   They robbed, and they were just out for some money. I think in that moment,\n   I didn't realize, but they took drugs.\n \n \n  "
