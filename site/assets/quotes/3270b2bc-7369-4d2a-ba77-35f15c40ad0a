  "text":"Mike: Yeah. But we were used to it though. I was used to it at least,\n   because growing up my mom didn't have a job so she couldn't provide for us\n   even if she wanted to, because she's illegal. So what we would do is we\n   would make fake CDs, and every morning I would just wake up, go to\n   different little towns and stuff, sell CDs.\n \n \n   Mike: That's how we made our money and we made a living. And I remember\n   growing up way too early, man. I used to cry sometimes, because I would\n   wake up at 5:00 in the morning. I'm like, \"Dude, I'm a little kid I don't\n   deserve this.\" You know what I mean?\n \n \n   Anne: You would sell CDs before school?\n \n \n   Mike: I didn't go to school. I would just sell\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: With your mom?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. I would sell CDs. Me and my mom would be the breadwinners\n   basically. There was no other way. I was the only one that talked English,\n   and it was just hard.\n \n \n  "
