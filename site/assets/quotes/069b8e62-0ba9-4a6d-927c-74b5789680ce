  "text":"Mike: Those two years. Those two years I was out of school and stuff. And\n   then I was in school with my mom, but in the mornings I would have to help\n   her. So sometimes I would have to miss school, sometimes I wouldn't go to\n   school. So then it was chaos.\n \n \n   Mike: Sometimes you'd go to school, sometimes you wouldn't. It just\n   depended on if you had money or if there was food on the table. But I got\n   used to it. There's just only so much crying you could do basically until\n   you're like, \"You know what? You just got to have that solid heart so\n   nothing can hurt you.\"\n \n \n  "
