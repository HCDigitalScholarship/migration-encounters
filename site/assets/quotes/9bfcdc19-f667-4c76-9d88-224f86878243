I would just go to school and listen to\n   everybody's voices\u2014I just went into school knowing just basic English, like\n   \"Can I go to the restroom?\" Or, \"I'm hungry,\" or \"I don't understand.\"\n   Those were the three words I would know and I would just listen to a lot of\n   voices and what they would say and I just quickly grabbed on to it.\n \n \n   Anita: How would you describe your English skills now?\n \n \n   Melani: Fluent.\n \n \n  "
