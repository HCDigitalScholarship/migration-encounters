  "text":"Laila: I was living in Arizona, and at that point the Sheriff Joe Arpaio\n   was actually the current sheriff of Arizona, and my high school was mostly\n   Latino. Mostly immigrants. We were all mostly from fourteen to seventeen, a\n   couple of eighteen-year-olds. And there was one day that there was somebody\n   circling, there was a rumor circling that there was going to be a raid\n   close to the school. We thought well, it's a school. Why are you going to\n   come raid a school? That wasn't even a thought for us.\n \n \n   Laila: We went to school, and at the time that we were going out, there\n   were sheriffs surrounding the school, stopping parents, stopping students,\n   seniors. There was a senior, a girl that we all kind of knew, she was\n   really nice to everybody, she got stopped because the sheriff said that her\n   back light was out or something like that and it was just an excuse to stop\n   her. She didn't have anything. She didn't have papers, so when the sheriff\n   told her \"I need to see an ID, I need to see something. She said, \"Well I\n   don't have any papers.\" So, at that moment she got taken in and sent to a\n   detention center.\n \n \n  "
