And when you guys go to the university, you guys are going to\n   have fun.\u201d I tell them that I wish I would have gone to the university\n   because that was one of my biggest things that I wanted to do, but I messed\n   up. So, I tell them, \u201cTake advantage, go through life for real, enjoy the\n   real life. You guys are born there, you guys have all the odds in your\n   favor.\u201d\n \n \n  "
