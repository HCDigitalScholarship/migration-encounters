  "text":"Juan: We had elections, presidential elections in Mexico. And I got here on\n   March 15. And since it was election time, they stopped issuing the only\n   identification that a Mexican citizen can have to do anything\u2014to open a\n   bank account, to rent a house, to get a passport, to get a driver\u2019s\n   license. That identification we cannot get because they are in elections\n   and we are not allowed to get in until the election is over, which is in\n   July. Ever since March, I haven't been able to get an identification where\n   I can reestablish my life precisely because I cannot open a bank account, I\n   cannot get a job. When you get a job here, they want you to get that\n   identification. They want you to show that identification just to show that\n   it's you. During this time, all the deportees and people returning to\n   Mexico are going through a very difficult time. Just because these people,\n   all they care is about that stupid election. All they care is about getting\n   their jobs and getting elected and all, while we ...\n \n \n   Juan: Every single program that is supposed to be helping us, they have,\n   quote unquote, \u201cprograms that help you with unemployment insurance\u201d and\n   things like that. They're supposed to help you. On the contrary, they are\n   just giving us the long run. They are just giving us, \"Oh no, they didn't\n   authorize the payment, you need to come back the next month.\" And next\n   month\u2026 It's been three months already, I have not been able to get anything\n   from them. And I haven't been able to get a job because I don't have an\n   identification. That is so stupid and ridiculous because how are we\n   supposed to live? How are we supposed to pay our rent or to even get money\n   for transportation to go and look for another job?\n \n \n   Juan: I can go look for a job, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't do any\n   good because I cannot identify myself. I don't have an identification to\n   identify myself. And the same problems that I have is the same problem that\n   I see in many, many people returning to Mexico from the United States.\n   These people, they are in very, very bad shape. Very bad shape because they\n   cannot get a job, they cannot open up an account, they cannot register\n   their kids in school. They cannot do anything because the authorities, they\n   don't care. They don't care about us, they don't care about nobody but\n   themselves. Another thing that I hate, I hate, I hate, it's like the time\n   stopped and it never moved. When I came back, it was the same corruption,\n   the same corrupted politicians, the same people that, instead of helping\n   the citizens, they're helping themselves, putting money in their pockets.\n   And all that money that is supposed to go to our programs to help\n   immigrants and people like us? They're going to their pockets.\n \n \n  "
