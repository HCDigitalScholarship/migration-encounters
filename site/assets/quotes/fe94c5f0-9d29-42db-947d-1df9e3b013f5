  "text":"Juan: I was twenty-one when I left for the United States and at the moment,\n   I'm fifty-two years old. I lived over there about twenty-eight years, so it\n   was the majority of my life. I never thought about coming back to Mexico\n   because I loved living over there. Just because I had my family established\n   and everything. I purchased a house, purchased a car. A lot of times you\n   can't even do that here in Mexico. It's very hard to purchase a house, to\n   purchase a car. It's very, very difficult. But over there, I already\n   accomplished that. And when I left over there, everything stayed back.\n \n \n  "
