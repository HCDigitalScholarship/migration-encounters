  "text":"So, do you think being in the States for those fifteen\n years made you a different person than you would have been if you had grown\n up here?\n      \n      \n Brenda: Probably. Sometimes I have very optimistic ideas about certain\n things. I think that\u2014not as a judgment towards anyone\u2014I'm a good kid over\n there. Sometimes a lot of it was because of fear of if you get in trouble.\n You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like \u2026 I was always\n told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many\n of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get\n into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.\n But I was always like, \u201cNo, because if something happens to me or the\n police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would\n involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.\u201d Here I think I would still do\n the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, \u201cYou\n can't go out.\u201d I'd be like, \u201cOkay.\u201d I'm still very obedient. All right, I\n don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with\n anyone.\n      \n      \n Brenda: I just do as I'm told. I think it would've been similar, but maybe\n have \u2026 I don't know, I probably would have started working a lot younger\n helping my family out and such. Over there because I couldn't work, it was\n mainly to stay in at home babysitting my siblings. I think those kinds of\n things, I wasn't as exposed to a lot of the world as I was\u2014or am now, here.\n I think that would have been different with my exposure.\n      \n      \n"
