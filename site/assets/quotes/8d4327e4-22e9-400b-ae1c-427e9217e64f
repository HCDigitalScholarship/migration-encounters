  "text":"Juan: Right now, my dad, he's always been the boss of the family. He's\n   always worked, he works in construction, and as you know, Utah, with the\n   climate change, it snows, it rains, all of the climates. Since he works in\n   construction, he does work outside all the time, so even if it snows or\n   even if it rains, even if it's minus five degrees outside, he still goes\n   out and works because nobody's going to give him the money to provide for\n   his family.\n \n \n   Juan: In a way, my dad, you can say he's one of those hard working men who\n   doesn't look out for himself, but rather looks out for his family."
