  "text":"So my mom would go\n in or my dad, and they would take my daughters in and I would talk to them.\n Talk to them or just joke around with them, play with them there from\n across the glass. That was my whole relationship with my second daughter.\n      \n      \n Axel: My first daughter, I did have some encounters with her. I did have\n some years with her there. But the important years, when she was actually\n talking and already doing stuff, I was never there. My second daughter\n neither. I did talk to them on the phone still, I did FaceTime to them, and\n my daughter just cried. She wants to know when I'm going to go visit, and I\n don't even know how to explain to her the whole situation. I just keep\n telling them, \"One day, just wait. One of these days, we're going to see\n each other. Either your mom comes over here or I go over there, but we'll\n see each other.\"\n      \n      \n Anne: So you're still friendly with the mom?\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. With both of them. And my family too. My family know that\n they're my babies, that they're my blood babies and my mom, \"It's not their\n fault for whatever mistakes you made. It's not their fault for whatever\n they're going through. That's your blood, that means that's my blood,\n they're my grandkids so I don't want to see them struggling, I don't want\n to see them doing bad.\"\n      \n      \n"
