You know the jobs that you get over there.\n   Like I said, I didn't feel like we were in a bad position where we needed\n   to go through everything that we went through. So my mom came back.\n \n \n   Sergio: So, what happened to the family after she left?\n \n \n   Josue: Oh, my parents split. Well, I think they were already splitting, and\n   you know, whenever she said, \u201cI'm going back with my little sister.\u201d Yeah,\n   that was like, \u201cOkay, yeah, they're splitting.\u201d\n \n \n   Sergio: They're splitting?\n \n \n   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah.\n \n \n   Sergio: And how did that impact you growing up there?\n \n \n   Josue: Honestly, not really. Because when she came back, I kind of already\n   knew that it was going to happen, and I wasn't that young to already not\n   really understand what was happening. So, my mom told me she wasn't happy\n   over there and I wanted her to be happy, you know?\n \n \n  "
