  "text":"Anne: How was school?\n      \n      \n Axel: School? Actually, school really wasn't that bad. At first, it was a\n little bit different, due to the language barrier, but...\n      \n      \n Anne: Because you hadn't learned English until then. Yeah.\n      \n      \n Axel: Right. Even though I did go as a little kid, you could go into\n kinder[garten] and stuff like that, everybody already speaks English and\n me, it was like I spoke a little bit that I heard here and there, but in my\n home, my parents didn't know English so they were always speaking Spanish.\n So in my home, it was always Spanish. Once I started going to school, my\n first years, it was kind of difficult. They put me in the ESL classes, and\n it actually really helped a lot. They did help a lot, they explained stuff\n a lot and by the first year or second year, I was already more\n understanding and I was getting it really quick.\n      \n      \n Axel: It's like they do say, once you learn it at a early age, it's kind of\n easier than learning at a older age, once you've already got this whole\n other concept of what you're doing. But I mean, yeah. After that, after my\n second year of school, it was actually pretty good breeze. Breeze through.\n Nothing like bullying, was never really an issue, anything like that.\n      \n      \n"
