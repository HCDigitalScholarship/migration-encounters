  "text":"Mike: And it took a whole month for the cops to come to my house. So I was\n   with my two little brothers and my little sister was born by that time. She\n   was like three, four. We stayed a whole month with nobody just by ourselves\n   in the house. And I remember this\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: How old were you?\n \n \n   Mike: I was 11, 12.\n \n \n   Anne: And you were the oldest?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. And that's that right there... I could see why single mothers\n   and people that just don't have any help, why they stress, or why they go\n   through all that stuff, or why they treat their kids bad and stuff, because\n   it\u2019s hard taking care of kids. I remember not having anything. On the last\n   day of the month, I opened the freezer, and there's nothing in there.\n   Nothing at all. And I'm like, \"What am I going to do? What am I going to\n   feed my little brothers and sisters?\" And then I was just like, \"You know\n   what? I'm just going to go to the store and just steal something. A bag of\n   chips, whatever.\" So I go in the store and the guy was really nice. He was\n   an Arab guy. He was always telling me, \"Hey, just pay me back tomorrow.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And I had remembered he had already done that. He gave me a bag of\n   chips, and he just told me, \"Pay me back whenever you come.\" So I was like,\n   \"Dude, I can't do that again, because I don't have no money this time\"\n   [Emotional]. So I remember I prayed to God. I prayed to God. I was like,\n   \"Please God help me. I don't want to steal from this man. He's really good\n   guy.\" And, oh dude, this is crazy, because I look in my pocket\u2014I had the\n   chips in my hand and I was acting like I had money. Sure enough, I reached\n   in my pocket, and I had a dollar. A freaking dollar. I was like, \"God I\n   know you're real.\" Because at that time I was like, \"Yeah.\" But I got home,\n   opened the little bag, put some lime, put some hot sauce, feed my little\n   brothers and sisters.\n \n \n   Mike: Then I'm telling you, we were so hungry that I had some seeds, some\n   plants\u2014the garden seeds and stuff. I went outside thinking that they were\n   going to grow in a couple of days. I made myself a little garden, I was\n   planting them, and I was like, \"Please, God...\" When I was praying, I was\n   like, \"Please God, let me get this food so I can feed my brothers and\n   sisters, because I don't know when my dad is going to come.\u201d And right when\n   I look up, I see two officers. A lady and then a man. They said they were\n   US Marshalls or something like that. They took us.\n \n \n   Mike: We stayed with them for a couple of days, and then they flew us back\n   to Arizona where my mom was staying at. So yeah, those two years being away\n   from her, my dad had lied to us and said that she didn't want us anymore\n   because she had another kid on the way. And yeah, my dad didn't care. He\n   just lied to us and said that my mom didn't want us.\n \n \n   Mike: So, I was thinking like, \"Why do you want us back? You say you didn't\n   want us.\u201d Little did I know all that. She told me all this stuff that\n   happened and I just started busting down and crying. And I was always mean\n   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she\n   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom\u2014got my mom butt naked and\n   put her in the closet\u2014and left her there and then took us to Texas\u2026 I used\n   to be mean to my little sister, but after I heard that, I was just like\u2014me\n   and her just got close and stuff. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
