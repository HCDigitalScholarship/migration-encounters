  "text":"I knew the basics, but\n   sometimes I'd start a conversation with a family member or somebody and\n   then they'd start saying a couple of words that I didn't understand, and I\n   would actually be like, \"Oh, what does that mean?\" A lot of people would\n   say, \"Oh, well it means this.\" But a lot of others would just laugh and\n   they'd be like, \"How could you not know Spanish if you're Mexican?\" And\n   it\u2019s like, yeah, I'm Mexican. I know the basics but\u2014I don't know, it was\n   very confusing. My mom used to always say that we were kind of nomads\n   because we weren't from the States. We were raised there but we're not from\n   the States, but we weren't from Mexico either because we may have been born\n   here, but we didn't know anything about it.\n \n \n  "
