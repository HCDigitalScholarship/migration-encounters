  "text":"That's why I found it a little bit harder when I\n started going to school here. To try to do my career was, obviously their\n language is a little bit more extensive, they explain things with some\n bigger words that I don't understand.\n      \n      \n Axel: Like I said, I don't like people asking me a lot of questions and I\n also don't like asking a lot of questions, because I don't like feeling\n like... I don't want people to think that I'm just not there with them. But\n it's not that I don't understand that, it's just that there's certain words\n that I just don't get the full meaning of it. And I don't want to be there\n in class like, \"Wait, wait, wait, wait. What does that mean?\"\n      \n      \n"
