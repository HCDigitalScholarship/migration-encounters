  "text":"Jose: It was kind of a drastic change when I was incarcerated for a mere\n   traffic violation and deported\u2014not deported, I got voluntary leave,\n   actually. The only thing I knew is that I didn't want to be locked up like\n   an animal for something so small. I'd rather be back in my city as a free\n   man and try to earn my right to go back to the States legally and just live\n   over there. It wasn't a good thing or a good feeling to be driving around,\n   just being anywhere, having a fearing of being detained for any minority. I\n   definitely want to go back. It's definitely a beautiful country and I just\n   think the circumstances have been very difficult, but I definitely want to\n   go back.\n \n \n  "
