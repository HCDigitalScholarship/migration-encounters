  "text":"Anita: Okay. How did you cross the border? Did you have a visa or did you\n   just cross the border?\n \n \n   Melani: Both my parents had work permits and they paid a coyote to cross\n   me.\n \n \n   Melani: I crossed through with a car in the desert. Well they had a contact\n   that they had a kid that was around my age and they made me go through as a\n   boy. And so\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: Really?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes. As someone else's child. I got dressed up as a boy so I could\n   cross the border with this other person, and my parents told me that I was\n   supposed to be in San Antonio at seven at night because that's what the\n   coyote told my parents, and they didn't find me until four in the morning.\n \n \n   Anita: Oh my God.\n \n \n   Melani: Yeah, so my parents thought I was already sold to the organ trade\n   or something. My mom was scared and then she found the coyote but they had\n   issues crossing and everything.\n \n \n   Anita: It was a pretty scary experience?\n \n \n   Melani: It was pretty [Affirmative sound]\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: Before they dressed you like a boy, did you have long hair?\n \n \n   Melani: Yes I did [Affirmative sound], but they cut it all off so I could\n   cross with them [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n   Anita: You were two?\n \n \n   Melani: I was two. I don't remember anything. They made me go as someone\n   else's child [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n   Anita: Did your parents tell you what happened? How did you get lost? Do\n   they know?\n \n \n   Melani: They said that the coyote told them that he was going to call them\n   at seven as soon as they got there, but they never called them and they\n   didn't know where to look because they had no other contact with him\n   whatsoever. Until later on that night, they said that they got a call from\n   him at four in the morning and my mom was already scared, but they couldn't\n   go to any authority because it was something illegal to do. So they just\n   picked me up and they just paid him off and then it was over.\n \n \n  "
