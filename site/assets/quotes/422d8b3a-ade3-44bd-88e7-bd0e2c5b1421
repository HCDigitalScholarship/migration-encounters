  "text":"Ilse: And so, I was left behind with my mom, and the woman with her son,\n   and we tried to cross the border through the desert. But it was awful. Even\n   being at the border, waiting for the instructions to go ahead and start the\n   journey, you know? And seeing so many people, and kids, and women... It was\n   just so bad, you know? And those images are so vivid in my head still. Then\n   after that, we were lost in the desert for three days. We ran out of water,\n   we ran out of food, we ran out of everything; the coyote got lost. And\n   there was a point... when it rains in the desert, it's so bad. Like, the\n   thunderstorms are so, so bad. I'll never forget how this woman that was\n   traveling with us, she was like hallucinating, I guess. It was so bad that\n   it was raining and that there was a thunderstorm, and she thought that this\n   one cactus was a person.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, she almost fell, so she thought she was going to grab onto\n   someone, and she grabbed onto the cactus, and all her body was left with\n   the little pikes. It was so bad, and then being lost\u2026\n \n \n   Ilse: We knew that they were going to be looking for us, obviously, or\n   someone out there, so we just decided to wait. We waited it out. But before\n   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was\n   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's\n   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,\n   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.\n   So, my mom and I got lost, right?\n \n \n   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just\n   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was\n   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,\n   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so\n   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on\n   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,\n   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,\n   \"Okay, we're going to wait it out.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything\n   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that\n   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I\n   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they\n   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this\u2014they\n   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal\n   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some\n   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and\n   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't\n   remember anything about that.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, \"Okay, I found out a way.\n   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking.\" And that was the third day.\n   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and\n   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.\n   So close. And yet so far, literally.\n \n \n  "
