I came here to talk to them. And\n   then, I knew that there were actually people that talked English. I thought\n   they weren't any, but there are. And then, yeah. That pretty much pulled me\n   out. I kept coming every day, every day. And then, different environment\n   pretty much put me in a different mindset of not being home all day,\n   eating. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
