  "text":"you said that you got involved with gangs. How old were you?\n      \n      \nAbel: I was about fourteen, fifteen, going to high school.\n      \n      \nAnne: Why do you think it happened?\n      \n      \nAbel: I think it was because I didn't have anybody to watch me. My mom had\nto go to work. She got out of work, like seven. My dad took off to work at\ntwo. He didn't get back until nighttime. So, I had this lapse of five hours\nthat I would get off of school at 1:50 and I had a park across the street\nfrom my house that a lot of my friends now hang out at. We're hanging out.\nWe started off just hanging out with the skateboards and the bikes. Little\nby little, it led to other things. So, I started hanging out with the\nhomies.\n      \n      \nAnne: We see that a lot, a lot of the deportees that have come back talk\nabout that.\n      \n      \nAbel: Yeah, it kind of pulls you. That's all you see. It was funny, because\nlike I said, you go out there, you see a beautiful town, but you don't know\nwhat's there until later. Because out there, everything's nice, compared to\nout here. It might be gang infested, but in the daytime it looks like\nBeverly Hills. You come out at night, it looks like Iraq.\n      \n      "
