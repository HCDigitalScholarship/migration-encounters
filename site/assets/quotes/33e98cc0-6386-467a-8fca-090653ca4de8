  "text":"Laura: I know and it's pretty hard for me to remember that my dad was, he\n   didn't want to go to work. He was just in his room crying for my mom\n   watching TV. He didn't want us to see him like that. But I was the oldest\n   sister and I do remember when my dad just hugged me and cry about my mom\n   and say, \u201cWhy she left us? Why?\u201d because we were girls. So, my dad didn't\n   know what to do with us because we were girls. It was pretty difficult for\n   me to see that as a daughter and see my dad crying. I mean, he didn't want\n   to go to work and we didn't have nothing to eat. We have family there, but,\n   you know, sometimes the family doesn't help us too much. You have more from\n   other people than the family.\n \n \n  "
