  "text":"Yair: Okay. Well, when I was like nine years, I left to the USA. Well, my\n   dad, he was already there. He was already like a year over there, and then\n   he was talking to my mom saying that he wished for us to be over there with\n   him and my mom decided to just go over there. I didn't know anything. I\n   thought we were just going to a different house closer to here. I was like,\n   \"Okay. Well, yeah, we'll go to my dad,\" because I hadn't seen my dad for a\n   year, and I was really happy. I was really excited, you know, because I\n   hadn't seen my dad. I really missed him.\n \n \n  "
