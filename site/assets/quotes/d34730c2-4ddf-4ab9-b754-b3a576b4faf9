So I've been to a whole bunch of schools. The only\n   school I remember that I went three years straight was Shiloh Park\n   Elementary School. I went there three years straight, which was from third\n   to sixth grade. But then when I was going to go middle school, we ended up\n   changing to another city.\n \n \n  "
