  "text":"Laura: I learned by myself because back in the time, there was no ESL\n   classes. So, when we went to Chicago, my mom took the time to get us into a\n   bilingual school. And in the bilingual school, some of the classes were in\n   Spanish and others in English, and I learn by hearing my classmates. And\n   the teacher was always like, \"Hey do this,\" and I'm like, \"What?\" And he\n   pointed at what I had to do, so I learned by seeing and hearing.\n \n \n  "
