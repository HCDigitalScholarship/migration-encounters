  "text":"But they don't receive them. They say they're not valid here because\n   they're not from the States. So we have to re-validate all of the studies,\n   and all of the papers, and all that. It takes a lot of time. It takes a lot\n   of money as well, to re-validate all of your studies so I just got\n   completely frustrated, and I told my mom I didn't want to go back to\n   school. But then when I started working, I saw that I did really need it,\n   so I opted for finishing high school outside of the norm. I'm not going to\n   school but I'm going to Saturday classes and all that, and I was able to\n   get certified for high school. Yeah. But it is really hard to go into\n   school here when you come back from the States when you're smaller because\n   they don't accept anything. You just have to start from zero. So a lot of\n   the subjects are different, or I [Chuckles] noticed a lot of the subjects\n   that they teach are very different. It is difficult to go back to school\n   [Chuckle].\n \n \n  "
