They pretty much throw us aside.\n   Unfortunately, the Mexican government does not think that people who are\n   returning from the States have anything to offer, and they're dead wrong\n   about that. Honestly, if you look at a lot of these people that are coming\n   back, they have so much to offer. They have so much to give and they have\n   so much drive and they're hungry, but they don't make it easy for us.\n \n \n  "
