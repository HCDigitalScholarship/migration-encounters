  "text":"Laura: No, sometimes I was missing school like too many days because I did\n   not want to go and people making fun of me. There was many people, Mexican\n   people that speak Spanish to me, but I wasn't feeling comfortable when I go\n   to my classrooms and I don't have like friends that speak English and speak\n   Spanish. So it was very uncomfortable for me. I was pretty scared of doing\n   homework. I was pretty scared reading the book when the teacher told me to\n   read it. I was pretty lost. I didn't know what to do, so I was afraid to go\n   to school.\n \n \n  "
