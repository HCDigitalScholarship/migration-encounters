  "text":"Jesus: Well, I want to visit here in Mexico first because I heard there's a\n lot of nice beaches and a lot of super nice places to go to. The forest and\n pyramids and stuff. I've been to a few, but I want to go to a lot more.\n Then after that, I want to go to Canada, so I could study. I want to be a\n pilot.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Cool. So, you want to go to school for that in Canada?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, because out here, it's super expensive. It's like two million\n pesos.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Oh, wow.\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. I don't think I can make it. [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Is that something you're planning on doing soon, or when do you\n think you'll try to do that?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Well, it has to be soon, because I'm getting older. [Both laugh].\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Is there an age limit on being a pilot?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Probably, but I want to be more like a personal pilot, so I could\n have my own plane and fly wherever I want.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Yeah, not so much flying the big commercial airline?\n      \n      \n Jesus: That would be nice, too. Boeing and stuff. That'd be super dope. But\n it would be more for private, a private thing. I could just have my plane\n and fly wherever. After that, I'm going to go to Greece.\n      \n      \n"
