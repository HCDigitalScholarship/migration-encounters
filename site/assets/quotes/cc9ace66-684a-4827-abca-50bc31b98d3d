  "text":"Miguel: Oh, yeah, definitely. I still have contact with friends that I was\n   in elementary school with. I have this particular friend; her name is\n   Cassandra. And she's always been my friend since I was in sixth grade. She\n   knows I'm out here. And she always sends me messages. They offered to help\n   with money and things like that, because they understand the situation out\n   here. And they understand the things I'm used to. Honestly, I was used to a\n   lot of good things out there and I was working and going to school. I was\n   able to buy myself things that I liked. And I can say it was affordable.\n   And out here it's hard, for example, to buy a pair of tennis shoes for 3000\n   Pesos and over there buying \u2018em for $60 or $50. It was hard. Being here was\n   very difficult because I was so used to having a car. I had a permit to\n   drive. I was able to drive, I paid my insurance and I was always making\n   sure that I was safe, you know, if anything happened to us.\n \n \n  "
