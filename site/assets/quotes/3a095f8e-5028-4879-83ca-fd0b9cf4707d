  "text":"Anita:\n \n \n   Yeah. Do you think that growing up in the U.S. you come back with certain\n   values?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Now that you mentioned it, yes, we do bring a lot of values, especially in\n   the cleanliness. In Mexico City, everybody's accustomed to whenever they\n   finish their package of whatever food they have, they just throw it on the\n   floor. Not everybody, of course, but most of the people do that. Us,\n   growing up in the States, we know that that's a horrible thing. Like, \"You\n   shouldn't do that. What type of person are you?\" You know? That's one\n   thing. Cleanliness. We bring that. Being independent. Over there in the\n   United States, when you're 18 like most of the people that turn 18, they\n   get to live in their own apartment, have their own car. Here in Mexico, of\n   course we can't afford it. Sometimes we're 25 and we still live with our\n   parents and we still have to give them some type of expense. Maybe that.\n   Being independent.\n \n \n  "
