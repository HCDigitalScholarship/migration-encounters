  "text":"Anita: Do you think that being in the United States, living there, that\n   there are certain things that made you feel American in any way?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. Yeah. Because there is one thing, and I'm going to put it\n   that way. Thanksgiving. Yeah. For me, Thanksgiving is like something that I\n   had to do on my own. First of all, at my house, they were like, \"What's\n   this? Why you do this?\" I go, \"It's because I thank God because I have food\n   on the table.\" That's something that we do every year. There\u2019s some points,\n   football, like baseball, basketball, things like that, that over here, they\n   don't see it that way. But Thanksgiving, yes, it's something important.\n \n \n  "
