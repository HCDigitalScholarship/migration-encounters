  "text":"Rocio: So his urine conduct was stuck. So they needed a major surgery and I\n   didn't pay anything. I paid with my medical and they sent me to the best\n   doctors and he's okay. So for me, that's why I'm so grateful for USA, I\n   love USA. So when this happened I was like, \u201cWhy?\u201d I mean, I understand\n   that not all the people that was to go to USA is going to be able because\n   everyone wants to go over there. But I mean if we are working, we are\n   paying taxes\u2014they don't give taxes back. Just if you have kids, they give\n   you $1,000 a year or something, but they don't give you more. And you still\n   paying taxes. I mean the people we are without, even driving ticket or\n   anything why they don't let us stay? Or like this family, they took my life\n   away without knowing what they doing. It was easy for them to call\n   immigration without thinking.\n \n \n  "
