I\n   like taking calls, it's nice.\n \n \n   Anita: But don't people scream at you?\n \n \n   Ivan: Not if you talk to them, you know? Like you got to talk to them...\n   But I mean, I do get kind of irritated sometimes. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anita: What irritates you?\n \n \n   Ivan: Sometimes the customers, they don't understand, they don't know where\n   some stuff is at. It just\u2014sometimes it gets irritating after a while. Yeah,\n   but it's a good job. I can't complain.\n \n \n   Anita: So, I wonder if you can tell me\u2014I know this is a little fake\u2014but\n   because it was so moving to me, in your own words what you told me outside.\n \n \n   Ivan: Yeah. What I like about this job is that it makes me feel like at\n   home, like in the States. Once I go in there, I forget about everything.\n   Just when I do go out the reality hits me and I see that I'm not in the\n   States, I'm in Mexico City. But I do like to be in there. If I could, I'd\n   stay in there. Like I do overtime, I like to be talking with the customers,\n   you know, in the States. Yeah. We have a good conversation sometimes.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you talk about lots of things about\u2014\n \n \n   Ivan: Well, we talk about the shows, you know, the programming, what's\n   available to talk about in TeleTech.\n \n \n  "
