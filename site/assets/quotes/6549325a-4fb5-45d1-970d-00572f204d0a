  "text":"nita: Oh. What's been difficult?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, first of all is because for some time I stayed without a\n   job. Why? Because I was trying to ... For me to find a job is really hard\n   because I had to be with him. At the same time, I had to take care of him\n   from school, so for me it was really hard. So, I found a job, but it was\n   two hours and a half from my house just to go. And to come back, it was two\n   hours and a half. It was almost four to five hours, so I wouldn't have time\n   for him. And not just to take him to the school, to help him to do\n   homework. It's really hard. But I stayed without a job for two months.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: So right now, I found a really good job. I mean, it's really good.\n   I work from Monday to Friday. It's 45 minutes away from my house, so it's\n   really good. And then I got Saturdays and Sundays off.\n \n \n  "
