  "text":"Luis: Okay. Well, initially my grandfather was working on the fields\n   somewhere in California. I don't remember exactly where. And we were living in\n   a really poor neighborhood in Mexico, in the State of Mexico, which is\n   outside of Mexico City. And we weren't doing so good. So I think it was\n   when the amnesty of \u201885 came in\u2014something like that\u2014my grandfather was\n   actually able to get papers to become a citizen. And he invited us to go\n   there and live with him. So my parents took on the offer, but we didn't\n   have money, or whatever to do it in a formal way. So we had to cross.\n   I was one, or maybe even less when I crossed. And yeah, that's how I got\n   into the first time. I was living in ____ at that moment.\n \n \n  "
