  "text":"Luis: So, it was May when they told him that he was going to die. They\n   said, \"You got three months tops man, you already have cancer in your brain\n   so you're going to die. I'm sorry but you're going to die.\" And when I\n   heard that, just\u2026 Sorry, I just start shaking whenever I remember. And I\n   don't know, he just started making preparations for when he was not here\n   for me.\n \n \n   Luis: He said, \"You have to find a job. Do you want to go back to your\n   mom?\" And I was like, \"I don't want you to die. Why the fuck are you doing\n   this to me?\" I'm sorry, but just I was so angry at him because he always\n   smoked. He was a smoker, he was a fucking chimney. The guy was a chimney.\n   My grandma used to be a chimney too but [pause] him leaving me alone in\n   there was the worst thing that could happen to me. Because I didn't know\n   how to live by myself. I was sixteen. I didn't know what the hell was going\n   to happen to me. So, the last time that I saw him, I saw him in his\n   hospital bed, he said, \"It's better for me to stay here. You're not going\n   to take care of me. I don't want you taking care of me. I want to go\n   through this alone. Okay? So I want you to keep going to school, keep doing\n   your stuff.\"\n \n \n  "
