  "text":"Anita: So, what happened to you in the States? So that you ended up back\n   here?\n \n \n   Ivan: I was in the wrong car. So, I was in a car that, they pulled us over\n   and I was just with the people, but they'd said that\u2014well they found drugs\n   in the car. So, they blamed me. But I was on the passenger side. So, I know\n   that the rules is whoever's driving or the car owner has to be responsible.\n   But they did not take it like that. They just said... I didn't want to give\n   them my name because I was scared. So, they took me for that too, giving a\n   false name. But on top of that they put all the charges on me. So, they\n   charged me for all the drugs because they didn't want to take the charge.\n \n \n  "
