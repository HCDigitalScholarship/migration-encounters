  "text":"Isabel: So then going from that, said your family moved, where did you move\n to?\n      \n      \n Ana: North Carolina.\n      \n      \n Isabel: North Carolina. And then how did you end up back in Mexico from\n there?\n      \n      \n Ana: Well, I got really sick. I got really depressed when we moved to North\n Carolina and to this day, I'm not a hundred percent sure if that's what\n triggered it, it's more than likely because it's the only thing I attribute\n to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got\n to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four\n times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just\n didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I\n refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, \"Well, we bought you a\n ticket to Mexico, so.\"\n      \n      \n Isabel: So your parents got you a ticket to Mexico so that you could\n receive help here?\n      \n      \n Ana: Yes. In Mexico, I have an uncle who's a doctor. So while I was in and\n out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting\n any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical\n records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I\n just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told\n my mom, \"You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send\n her so that I can help her.\" So my parents were like, \"Okay.\" And they just\n sat me down. They told me that I had to go get my passport because I was\n coming to Mexico.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And was it difficult receiving healthcare in the States with your\n undocumented status?\n      \n      \n Ana: Definitely. I wouldn't say that people are harsh. I think that there's\n a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when\n you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to\n explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure\n that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the\n word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my\n mom trying to ask, \u201cWhat's wrong with her? What can they do?\u201d Doctors just\n going, \"She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's\n it.\" Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just\n kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the\n hospital, getting more blood transfusion. It was basically just base work.\n It wasn't someone actually asking you or checking to see if everything was\n okay, it was mostly of, \"What's going on with you right now?\" \"I'm bleeding\n out.\" And doctors going, \"Are you having an abortion? Are you\u2026\"\u2014A\n miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion\u2014and it was just hard at that time\n because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was\n still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there\n was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being\n able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You\n can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be\n there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that\n it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.\n      \n      \n"
