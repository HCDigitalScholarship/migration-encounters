  "text":"Claudia: And kind of along that same line, it's, what can the United States\n   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave\n   behind? What do you think?\n \n \n   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even\n   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that\n   says, \"Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here.\" Maybe just really\n   giving them a chance to\u2014especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and\n   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I\n   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.\n \n \n   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that \u201cWhy would they be\n   invaded by Mexicans?\u201d But they also have to understand the situations here.\n   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.\n   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the\n   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican\n   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing\n   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked\n   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not\n   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze\n   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work\n   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]\n \n \n  "
