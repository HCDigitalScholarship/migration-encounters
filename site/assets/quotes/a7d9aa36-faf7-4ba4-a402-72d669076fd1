  "text":"Anita: Thank you for sharing your story.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No, thank you to you. I wanted to talk. I mean, this is something\n   that is like therapy, because it helps me. Yesterday, one of my friends\n   came, and she was like, \"You need this. You need to go.\" I'm like, \"Okay.\"\n \n \n   Anita: And? How do you feel now?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I like it. I like it a lot. It's something new. It's something\n   that I'll let everything go at this moment.\n \n \n   Anita: You really sound like an incredible dad.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Thank you. I appreciate it.\n \n \n   Anita: It's very, very moving.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I appreciate it. I've been here for a lot of time. It\u2019s tough to\n   be a dad sometimes. Sometimes there is things that I want to do, but I\n   can't because I have to be at home.\n \n \n   Anita: You know, I've been hearing stories all day long, about kids who\n   went, and their Mexican dads abandoned them.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No, that won't happen.\n \n \n   Anita: I'm ending my day \u2013 You are helping me.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No, I mean\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: You are giving me\u2014\n \n \n   Rodrigo: One of the reasons that I will never do that, is because my dad,\n   when he was in the states, he left me.\n \n \n   Anita: Your dad did it.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: He left me. From that, I was like, \u201cNo.\u201d From that, I was like,\n   \"No, I can't do that.\" I mean, I wouldn't do it. My son is my son, and\n   he'll always be there.\n \n"
