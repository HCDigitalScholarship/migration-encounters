  "text":"Yordani: So, I found this mushroom and I prepared it, cut it up, put it in\n   the oven, dried it, made tea out of it and I had it. And the crazy thing is\n   when I had it, I guess it was toxic. I read a lot about it, it is toxic, a\n   lot of people were like, \"But it's not toxic enough to harm you.\" And\n   people report a feeling of less anxiety after they take it. And I did feel\n   that, it did help.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So it did help a bit?\n \n \n   Yordani: Uh-huh (affirmative). Yes. I felt less anxiety. So I was dumb. I\n   was like, \"Okay. I guess if that took away this much anxiety, like if the\n   more I do it the more it's going to have an effect."
