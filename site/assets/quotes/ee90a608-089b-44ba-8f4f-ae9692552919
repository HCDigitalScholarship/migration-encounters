  "text":"Luisa: There was this one book by Clive Owen, I believe, something about\n   the demons. I don't know. We had a huge discussion about that book. He\n   would give me a bunch of books from his collection and we would discuss it.\n   We would discuss the original. We would discuss Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli. I\n   actually have \u201cthe end justifies the means\u201d tattooed on me.\n \n \n   It\u2019s tattooed back here. Realism to me was \u2026 it's real. Human beings are\n   selfish by nature, but the beauty of it is that we have our own free will\n   and we can go above our nature and we can do great things, so this just\n   reminds me that I'm not just an animal that's looking for my own benefit,\n   if that makes sense.\n \n \n  "
