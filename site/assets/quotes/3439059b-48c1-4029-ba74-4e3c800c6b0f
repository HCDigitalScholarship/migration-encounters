  "text":"Lizzy: Is there anything that you feel like the Mexican government should\n   be doing or that they could be doing differently to support return migrants\n   like you?\n \n \n   Yordani: Well yeah, I guess... A lot of people here have trouble with their\n   papers, like school papers. They probably graduated or they have college\n   and they come here and it's like they have nothing. Maybe something to\n   accommodate that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Yes, I've heard that from a lot of people.\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah. That's definitely the number one thing.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Did you have trouble with that, your papers from high school in the\n   U.S.?\n \n \n   Yordani: I mean, I came and yeah they had to ask me for like get my\n   transcript. I mean the school did give me my transcripts. Other people here\n   have trouble with that, they won't get their transcript unless they were\n   there in person. I mean, I guess I was lucky that I got those. I guess I\n   didn't really struggle too much with that, but I see how other people do.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So making the education system easier to try to transfer-\n \n \n   Yordani: To validate their studies, yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Yeah.\n \n \n   Yordani: So they can integrate to the schooling system here.\n \n \n  "
