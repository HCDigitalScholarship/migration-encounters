  "text":"Mike: We stayed with them for a couple of days, and then they flew us back\n   to Arizona where my mom was staying at. So yeah, those two years being away\n   from her, my dad had lied to us and said that she didn't want us anymore\n   because she had another kid on the way. And yeah, my dad didn't care. He\n   just lied to us and said that my mom didn't want us.\n \n \n   Mike: So, I was thinking like, \"Why do you want us back? You say you didn't\n   want us.\u201d Little did I know all that. She told me all this stuff that\n   happened and I just started busting down and crying. And I was always mean\n   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she\n   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom\u2014got my mom butt naked and\n   put her in the closet\u2014and left her there and then took us to Texas\u2026 I used\n   to be mean to my little sister, but after I heard that, I was just like\u2014me\n   and her just got close and stuff. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
