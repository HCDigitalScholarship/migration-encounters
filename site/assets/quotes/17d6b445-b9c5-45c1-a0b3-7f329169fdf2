If it was her being offered something, we would\n just console each other. We would just tell each other, \"No, you did good.\n It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you\n don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.\" So it was\n just me and my sister.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential\n opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult."
