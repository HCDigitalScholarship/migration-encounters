  "text":"Jose: Yeah, I did after a while. After the whole English thing. I was about\n   two years in and I was able to speak English not perfectly, but well enough\n   for me to understand what the teachers were telling me and all that. During\n   middle school, I was actually in advanced classes. The whole advanced\n   classes thing was when my parents were splitting up and I started acting\n   out and getting into trouble and stuff. And that's what led me into high\n   school. Once I got into high school, I was kicked out of all my advanced\n   classes because I was acting out in my classes before that. Eventually,\n   through that whole year, it was a big downfall for me. As my parents were\n   splitting up, I was acting rebellious, trying to get attention.\n \n \n  "
