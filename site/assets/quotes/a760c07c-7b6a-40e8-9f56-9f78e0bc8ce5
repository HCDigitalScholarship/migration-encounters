  "text":"Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he\n   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I\n   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to\n   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's\n   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,\n   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my\n   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.\n \n \n  "
