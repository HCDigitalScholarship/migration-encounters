  "text":"Anita: Why didn't they stay behind?\n \n \n   Luisa: I think my mom felt guilty. I think she didn't want me to be by\n   myself. She felt guilty that she didn't allow me to apply for DACA, so\n   she's like, \"Okay. That's okay.\" Eventually my sisters are going to have to\n   go through this and let's do it now so the change doesn't hurt them as much\n   when it comes down to it. They had it a little easier, I think [Chuckles].\n   They didn't have to go through it twice, or maybe that's just my\n   bitterness, but I had to go through that uprooting and going into a strange\n   country twice [Chuckles]. They don't remember Mexico at all, so I don't\n   think they remember any of the life that we had here.\n \n \n  "
