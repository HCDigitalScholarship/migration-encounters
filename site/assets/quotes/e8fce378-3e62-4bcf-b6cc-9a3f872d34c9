Or they'll just pull up on the motorcycle\n   and just get the money away from you, or whatever you do have. I know when\n   you are in the States it's not even like that. Or if it happens, it's one\n   in million, or you know? But not all the time. Like here, I've been robbed\n   here like three times already.\n \n \n  "
