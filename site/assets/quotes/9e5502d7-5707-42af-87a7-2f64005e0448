  "text":"But yeah, it was\n   kind of tough. And also, the whole culture kids are not used to, or maybe\n   just humans, they're not used to like alien things. Because I remember I\n   didn't know to say \u201csalad.\u201d And when I was at lunch, I will always try to\n   eat a salad, try to be healthy, but I didn't know it was called a salad.\n   So, I will just call it green thingy\u2014I think it was my go-to word for\n   whatever I didn't know. I will just tell them, \"Okay, can I have that green\n   thingy?\u201d And they will give it to me but they would look at me strange. And then one kid got really offended for some\n   reason, like \"It's called a salad dude do you even speak English?\u201d And that\n   was it, then I got really offended as well. And I was like well, \"Of course\n   not. If I would, I would call it a salad.\u201d It was dumb. But anyway, so\n   yeah, that was strange. Also like the promiscuity of kids in that high\n   school was really amusing to me. It's like holy cow, twelve, thirteen year\n   olds already doing those things?! because my family's like really, is\n   liberal in the sense that everything's okay, but at the same time they\n   don't talk about it. So I mean, for me it was like a real shock. And\n   also malls\u2014malls were super scary. My first time going into a mall was when\n   I came back. When I was in high school. They're like these massive\n   buildings and a lot of people there just buying stuff and the flashing colors, it was\n   crazy. Anyway, it was an experience. And then we moved to an apartment.\n \n \n  "
