  "text":"Isabel: Where do you think\u2026 you said your mom instilled that kind of\n   mentality or value. Do you attribute a lot of your personality and stuff to\n   your mom? Or what do you think really shaped you?\n \n \n   Weco: I think my mom on one hand side, and the streets. My mom and the\n   streets.\n \n \n   Isabel: In what way?\n \n \n   Weco: Because my mom was hard with me. She was never that, \"What you need?\n   I got you.\" Or \"What's going on? I got you.\" She was like, \"What's going\n   on? That's your problem. You did that. That's your problem. You need what?\n   Go get it yourself.\" I had a hard mom. I love her though, but she was\n   pretty tough on me.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah, tough love.\n \n \n   Weco: Tough love. More than my brothers, because they can ask for, \"Oh, I\n   need this.\" \"Get them.\" I don't see why she did that, but sometimes I'd be\n   like it might've been for a good thing because I am who I am now.\n \n \n  "
