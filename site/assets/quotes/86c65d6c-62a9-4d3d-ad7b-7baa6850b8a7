  "text":"Ivan: In this case Mexico, they need to change the way they think. How can\n   I put it in words? Mexico is even, I would say, I don't know. I don't know\n   about that one. They tried to make changes in the past, but it hasn't\n   worked. The major problem here in Mexico is the corruption. It's all of\n   Mexico is, the way it is right now, because corruption is just with\n   corruption. I will say like, I don't know, I don\u2019t know. I don't know how\n   to change that, how would they do that? Because every time a new president\n   comes in, they're like, \"Okay, we're going to make a change, everything's\n   going to change, no more corruption.\" And then they get to the power and\n   they forget about that. They want everything for them, so I don't know how\n   they will change corruption in this country. Because I will say they, they\n   change the whole government. They make a new system, but people still going\n   to be corrupt. I don't know how to answer to that one. That one's tough.\n \n"
