We just had a very badly\n researched attorney, I guess. He had gotten one of my uncle\u2019s\n citizenship\u2014and funnily enough, not the uncle that was with that aunt. He\n didn't end up being able to get residency or anything, and I don't know why\n we went with him specifically. But he just kept saying, \"You have to\n leave.\" I remember telling everybody, \u201cOkay, outside of having to leave at\n this time, I keep seeing that a lot of people that do this immigration\n process, in particular, don't leave the US. They never leave the US, they\n stay there.\u201d Everybody goes, \"I know, but you don't understand it's\n different.\" I was like, \"It's really not, it's adoption-based immigration\n process.\u201d So, I'm always like, \"No one listened to me, so that's why\n [Chuckle] this happened.\""
