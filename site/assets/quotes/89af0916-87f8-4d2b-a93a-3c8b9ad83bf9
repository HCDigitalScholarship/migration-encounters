  "text":"Anita: So just on that, what's it like to have a son who's the same age as\n   when you left? Does it bring you back?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah, it brings me back memories because I see him and I see a lot\n   of me in him. I know some mom and the dad, but when I see him, I'm like,\n   \"Hey, I used to do that,\" or, \"Oh my God. I used to do that. If we were in\n   the States, he could do this or that. He could be better.\" Sometimes it\n   hurts because I know there's something better for him, but I can't give it.\n \n \n  "
