  "text":"Beto:\n \n \n     \"Do you ever go-\" \"Yes, I go to the Dodger Stadium.\" \"Okay. How do you\n     feel?\" \"Good. A new thing. That's a new thing. That's an American culture\n     thing.\u201d \u201cYou joined them, right?\" \"Yes.\" \"But what are you?\" Mexican. You\n     don't have to be wearing all these Dodgers thingys. Because I used to wear\n     my regular clothes to a Dodger Stadium whenever. You don't go like wearing\n     you cap and, \"Oh, I'm a Dodger fan.\"\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Did you wear a Mexican Jersey?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     No, it was regular. Yes.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Were you a soccer fan?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     A little bit, not much. I was more into American football when I was\n     little. I just admire when they used to train at high school. I loved that.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Who was your team?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     At that moment, we had this team which was the LA Raiders. They were my\n     actual team and the Rams. Yeah, but I don't know what happened. They moved\n     to Oakland. We don't have no more, like, the LA team. It is in Oakland, but\n     we don't get this feeling like, \"Oh my team.\"\n \n \n    "
