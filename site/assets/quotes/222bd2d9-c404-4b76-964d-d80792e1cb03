  "text":"Anne: So, you said you had voluntary departure. So, what happened?\n \n \n   Laura: I got caught driving without any license. Well, I was told that if I\n   voluntary departure from the US, I wouldn't be in any trouble. So, I did\n   what it was best for me because we went to a lawyer and that's what the\n   lawyer suggest. So, that was six months, the timeframe that the judge gave\n   me to leave the US.\n \n \n   Anne: So, you got caught driving without a license? Was there an infraction\n   or did you just get pulled over for\u2026?\n \n \n   Laura: I got pulled over. Well, they didn't tell me. They tell me that I\n   haven't made the five second stop or something like that, but I did, but\n   they say that I didn't. So, when the police find out that I didn't have any\n   driver's license, he asked me about my status. I told him that it was\n   illegal to ask about the status, but they tell me that if I was illegal\n   they will have to call ICE on me. I was like, \"Come on, please don't do\n   that.\" And, of course, I was begging for not to call ICE. So, they find out\n   that I was illegal. So, basically\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: They called ICE?\n \n \n   Laura: They called ICE.\n \n \n   Anne: And you said a lawyer told you to listen to...?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, we talked to a lawyer. Well, I was having my judge\n   appointment, like my court, but the lawyer tell me that if I voluntary\n   departure, I didn't have to go through all of that because if they deport\n   me, will be worse for me. So, I went to voluntary departure.\n \n \n   Anne: And how long did that take?\n \n \n   Laura: They took about six months, approximately.\n \n \n   Anne: And were you in detention or were you at home?\n \n \n   Laura: I was in home but I have the little thingy, the, I don't know.\n \n \n   Anne: You had an ankle bracelet.\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, ankle. I was like, \"Come on.\" [Chuckle]. Why?\n \n \n  "
