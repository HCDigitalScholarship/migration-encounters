  "text":"Dan: Sure. Obviously, back then I didn't have no documents. I start working\n   with this guy as a helper. He was a contractor for Home Depot putting the\n   countertops, taking off the Formica, the wood countertops and putting\n   marble or granite. I was doing that with him for about a year, but we were\n   looking how other people in that same house were putting hardwood floors,\n   painting, and doing this and that. I was gathering their info. It was like,\n   \"Hey, this is your own business?\" \"Yeah.\" \"Okay. How much do you charge the\n   square footage of our engineering wood floors?\" \"Okay. I'll let you have it\n   for $1.50.\" So I start getting all that information. And at one point, the\n   guy that I was working with, he moved. He bought his own house, but it was\n   way too far. So he invited me over and he said, \"Hey, I'll pay you rent on\n   an apartment nearby, but I need your help.\" And I was like, \"No.\" And at\n   that moment, I printed my own business cards and I knew how to paint, so I\n   was painting houses. I was painting inside interiors, outside exteriors.\n   And I started selling out other people's jobs. For instance, I would say,\n   \"Hey, I'm looking you're remodeling your house. I can do the engineering\n   hardwood floors for $2.50.\" And I said, \"Okay, do you have a catalog?\" So I\n   will run to ... By then, I knew where the hardware stores were, the\n   outlets, and they will give me a good rate. If the square footage was\n   $1.00, I would resell it for $1.50 or $1.15. And that how I was making out\n   my money. I would give somebody else the job, making money out of them, and\n   just making money out of the material. That's how I was making money. All\n   of a sudden, when I least expected, I was doing electricity, I was doing\n   plumbing, I was doing the sprinkler system. I was just doing pretty much\n   everything around the house, concrete, shingles, roofing. I was subscribed\n   with an insurance company. I believe it was Allstate Farm where all the\n   damages would give it to me and they will pay me straight up. I was there.\n \n \n  "
