You are in the wrong hood, you're wearing the wrong color, you're going\n   to get beat up.\n \n \n   Mike: If you don't got a gun, like you're going to get either shot, or\n   you're going to get beat up. It's one of the two. So, you always had to be\n   ready. And yeah man, just it's a lot of stuff. I'm sorry. What was I\n   talking about? I don't even remember what I'm talking about anymore. It's\n   just so much things running through my mind.\n \n \n  "
