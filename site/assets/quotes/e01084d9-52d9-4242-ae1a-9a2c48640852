  "text":"Jose: I was driving. It was like a Sunday, no a Saturday. I was with my\n   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was\n   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and\n   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was\n   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and\n   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I\n   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.\n   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to\n   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I\n   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent\n   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was\n   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,\n   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though\n   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the\n   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it\n   was my best option.\n \n \n  "
