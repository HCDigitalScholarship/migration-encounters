I\n don't even have to ask them, they'll just tell me, \"Hey, right now I'm\n going to send you some money or I'm going to do this, I'm going to give\n your kids something, where can I meet them? Blah, blah, blah.\" I know that\n they're going to help me, but I don't like to ask them because it's not\n something that I don't really like to ask them for, for stuff because I\n know it's not their fault that I got deported or anything like that.\n      \n      \n"
