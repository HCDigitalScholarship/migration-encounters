Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven\n   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,\n   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and\n   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,\n   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.\n \n \n  "
