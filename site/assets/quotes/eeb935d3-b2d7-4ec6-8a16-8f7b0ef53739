Since we were the last two people with the coyote, the\n   coyote took us to our mom. She was in a restaurant because she work as a\n   waitress. And when we got there, she was crying. She was actually carrying\n   dishes and the dishes just fall because she was really impressed. We\n   haven't seen her in one year so she was really impressed and she drop all\n   the dishes. We were all crying, you know. [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
