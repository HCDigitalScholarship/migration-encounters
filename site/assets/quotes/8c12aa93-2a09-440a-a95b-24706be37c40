  "text":"Right when I had graduated\n   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel\n   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, \"You know what?\n   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of\n   us.\" But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or\n   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're\n   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where\n   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and\n   she did not allow that."
