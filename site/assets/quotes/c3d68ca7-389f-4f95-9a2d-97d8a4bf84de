Because if they take you to the judge and the judge deport you,\n   you never going to come back.\u201d So in the moment I was like, of course in\n   shock, I was thinking about my kids. I was like what I need to do to don't\n   have more problems. Just sign, you need to sign, you don't go to the judge\n   because they going to deport you or they going to take your kids away and\n   blah, blah, blah. So I just signed.\n \n \n  "
