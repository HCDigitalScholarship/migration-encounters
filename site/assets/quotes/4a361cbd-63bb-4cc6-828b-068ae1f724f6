  "text":"Angelo: There could have been more people that heard my story, there could\n have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody\n should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read\n the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And\n I just feel like somebody could have said, \"Well, hold on, this makes no\n sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened.\" But it was never,\n \"Okay, what happened?\" It was always, \"Okay, you did this.\" So that's where\n I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had\n no voice\u2014and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the\n bad guy because a little baby got hurt.\n      \n      \n Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were\n people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said\n something\u2014you didn't even have to actually do it\u2014just because a woman said,\n \"You know what, he did something,\" it was, \"You're going to jail,\" just\n because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,\n and just hearing all these stories, I was like, \"There's no way that I'm\n going to get past this.\" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.\n 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had\n to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was\n not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was\n different, I was completely\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through\n things in jail of all these things, I told myself, \"Why are you here then?\n You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why\n am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing\n for some time?\" I was like, \"Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going\n to go home, you're going to see your mom.\" And then out of nowhere you get\n this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, \"No, no, no, no,\n no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No.\" And so it\n was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.\n The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation\n that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all\n I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not\n being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or\n recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very\n hard.\n      \n      \n"
