Then this guy told her, \"Well, you're going to\n   stop by over my house. You can stay there,\" and this and that. This guy was\n   the one that was going to cross us over, but I can't remember what was the\n   issue though, but I think my dad had to send the money over to him again,\n   but in the meanwhile, we were staying at his house for like a month.\n \n \n  "
