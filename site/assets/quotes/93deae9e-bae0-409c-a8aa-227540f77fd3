  "text":"Adrian: Do you think there\u2019s something, the government from Mexico, they\n   can work together with the government of the United States so they can stop\n   getting the families separated?\n \n \n   Juan: I truly believe that they can. It's just, their politics get in the\n   way. All of these immigration things, it's all about politics, it's all\n   about control, controlling the American people and controlling the Mexican\n   people. If they wanted to, they could have many agreements, so we didn't\n   have to go illegally. And they could have had many, many agreements to\n   allow people to go to work and come back. Because people don't want to go\n   and stay. People do not want to go and stay there and live there. They want\n   a better life. And they want to make money and many times just come back\n   and do things that they cannot do because of the Mexican government.\n \n \n  "
