  "text":"Mike: That was going on high school. I think it was my freshman year,\n   because like I said man, it's just all these things that happen to you,\n   there's just only so much you could take to where you're like, \"You know\n   what? Eff it.\" You're just done with everybody and you're just like, \"You\n   know what? If life paid me back like this, then why should I care?\" You\n   know what I mean? And it makes me feel like inferior at times.\n \n \n   Mike: So yeah, I feel like it was around my freshman year, everything\n   started going downhill, because I used to be in events, classes, and all my\n   teachers loved me. I would have conversations like this with my teachers\n   and they'd be amazed sometimes like, \"Wow, this kid has so much insight. So\n   much to talk about.\" And they would always encourage me, but the thing\n   about it is I wouldn't feel like that.\n \n \n  "
