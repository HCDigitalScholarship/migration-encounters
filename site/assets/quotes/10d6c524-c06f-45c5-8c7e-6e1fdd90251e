He's\n   helped me get through a lot of traumas. He's helped me stand up to my\n   father because I was not able to have a conversation with him. I was not\n   able to say no to my dad [Sniffles]. I always wanted to please my dad\n   because I never had him in my life, so I wanted him to be happy with me\n   now. He's helped me a lot, so scary shit [Chuckles]. I don't like thinking\n   about it.\n \n \n  "
