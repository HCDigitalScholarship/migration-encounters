  "text":"Mike: And that's when I knew I was like, \"Damn, I got to watch out for this\n   guy.\" You know what I mean? Because they love you, that's your family, but\n   they feel like you got it\u2014because you're from there, or you came from\n   there, or your family's going to support you. So he'd always try to get as\n   much as he could. That's why I felt like I got to kind of stay away from\n   him. Those are the people you've got to love, but keep your distance from.\n \n \n  "
