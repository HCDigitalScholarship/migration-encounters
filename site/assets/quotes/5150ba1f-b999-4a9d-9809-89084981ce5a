  "text":"Claudia: And so, how did you cross the border with your mom and your\n   siblings, with a coyote or did you just go by yourselves?\n \n \n   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,\n   they're like, \"So you guys won\u2019t come alone, meet up with that family, so\n   you can all come over.\" And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a\n   son\u2014he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,\n   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.\n \n \n   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And\n   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to\n   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my\n   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I\n   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.\n \n \n   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he\n   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say\n   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these\n   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.\n   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,\n   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.\n \n \n  "
