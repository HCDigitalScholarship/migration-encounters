  "text":"Rodolfo: I feel like, obviously because of the corruption or anything they\n   don't want to help us because they much rather keep that money for\n   themselves then to give it out. So, I feel like more awareness as well. If\n   there is that help, then let us know. Let us know we have that help. Let us\n   know you are there and we can help. Not just that we've come here from a\n   different country and now go ahead, do whatever you can. No, I mean, just\n   help us out too.\n \n \n   Sergio: I'm just wrapping up. Why do you think so many people from Mexico\n   have a negative perception of returning migrants?\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Because of what their family members tell them. And the reason why\n   returning deportees have a bad perception or a bad idea or a bad image of\n   why they shouldn't come back is because well, in the first place, their\n   family... Every individual has their own story, right? Obviously, that\n   individual's family has told them the story of why they moved to America.\n   And if they themselves, if their own family didn't want to live here, that\n   in its own instills fear in them.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I mean, we're humans, right? We fear the unknown. We fear what we\n   don't know, especially we fear change. We're creatures of habit. If you\n   take me out of my element, if you took me out of Chicago, I'm like, \u201cShit,\n   I don't know what's going on man.\u201d I didn't know I couldn't walk after I\n   paid my tacos. I didn't know I had to give back [inaudible 00:25:14], the\n   glass bottle. I didn't know that. I didn't know I had to pay five pesos if\n   I want to use the bathroom around here.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: My family painted me a picture of here that it was going to be\n   horrible. Because that's what they lived, that's what they know. That's the\n   reason why they moved. Like, \u201cHey man, living over there is going to be\n   horrible. Don't go over there, fight the case, stay here. You're not going\n   to be able to do anything over there, it's so hard. Minimum wage\u2014the pay is\n   horrible, the jobs are horrible.\u201d And they're feeding you what they know\n   and what they lived because they don't know any better, they don't know\n   anything else.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: And for a person who doesn't know a country, then they're going to\n   take heed to that. If I watch a movie and I tell my friend, \u201cHey man, don't\n   watch that movie, that movie is horrible.\u201d Yeah, I watched it, you didn't\n   and now you're going to take my opinion and apply it to your own beliefs.\n   Okay, well, I mean, he's my friend he wouldn't lie to me, why would he lie\n   to me? You're my mom, you're my brother, my sister, whatever. If you say\n   it's bad, it's bad.\n \n \n  "
