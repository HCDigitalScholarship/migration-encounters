The kids were like making fun of us\n   because we didn't have any good English of course. They were like Americans\n   so they were basically always bullying us because we were not American. So\n   that was one of the, how do you say, the\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: The barriers?\n \n \n   Laura: The barriers, yeah. The barriers, took us more time to learn\n   English. Yeah it was actually pretty complicated. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anne: How was school?\n \n \n   Laura: At first it was awkward. I didn't want to go to school because the\n   kids were all making bully. They were all bullies. I actually got into a\n   fight about two times because the kids were always making fun of us, that\n   we were like Mexicans. But after that, in high school, it got better.\n \n \n  "
