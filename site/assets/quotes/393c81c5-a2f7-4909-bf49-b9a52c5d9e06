It's like puns or something like that. They say\n   something, but it means something else, and there's a lot of that. It's\n   like you say one thing and then it's not... it doesn't mean that, it means\n   something else. And so, you've got to like kind of learn to decipher that.\n   It was really hard at first, I would always be out of the loop like, \"Wh-\n   What?\", because that was hard.\n \n \n  "
