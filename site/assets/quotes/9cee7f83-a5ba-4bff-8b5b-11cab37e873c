  "text":"Anne: So you said that you liked it, because it got your parents upset?\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: Was this your mom and stepdad?\n \n \n   Mike: Oh yeah.\n \n \n   Anne: Why were you so mad at your mom do you think?\n \n \n   Mike: Because all this stuff that happened, I kind of blamed it on her.\n   Slowly I started saying because of one decision that she had made, all our\n   lives got messed up, even if she wanted to or not, point blank period. But\n   then I didn't think on both sides. I was really young, so I would always be\n   like \u201cMe, me, me.\u201d When I started getting older, I realized like, \"Dude,\n   she only did it to give us a better life.\"\n \n \n   Anne: So you are saying the decision to come to the US was what...\n \n \n   Mike: Not even that, it's just getting with my stepdad. I'd always had\n   trouble listening to male authority, just because I didn't have that at\n   all. So every time he would tell me to do something, I'd get so mad. I just\n   want to punch him in the face. And it sucked, man, because he would always\n   try to tell me stuff\u2014he would do it for my own good.\n \n \n   Mike: He would never get out of hand talk to me, but I would always explode\n   on him. I would treat him like the parent that I never had who wanted to be\n   back in my life. So you know you could kind of treat him like however you\n   want? That's how I would treat him. And I just started realizing over time\n   my dad just\u2014this guy really cares about us. He's providing for five kids\n   and still doesn't ask for anything.\n \n \n   Mike: It just started growing on me and we started getting along and it\n   started getting better. But yeah, I would not get along with my mom, or my\n   dad at all. And my mom was\u2014I feel like a lot of Mexican women and men, they\n   have something against black folks even if you want to or not. I feel like\n   that's racist too, because my mom would always be like, \"Why do you hang\n   out with them? Why do you do this? Why do you do that?\"\n \n \n   Mike: I'm like, \"Because they're cool, man. They're like... I feel like\n   these are my people. They've gone through the same struggles, a lot of the\n   same stuff that happened to them. They would happen to me.\" So I would\n   always bring them over, and I remember one time my mom got so mad she\n   grabbed an orange and threw it at my friend, but my friend was so tall, he\n   just caught it.\n \n \n  "
