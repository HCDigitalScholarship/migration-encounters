  "text":"my Spanish has gotten much\n better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to\n be, \"How long have you been in Mexico?\" \"I've been here 10 years.\" And\n they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, \"We can still\n tell you have an accent.\" Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to\n fuck up. And they're just like, \"But you've been here 10 years.\" And it's\n kind of like, \"Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six\n years.\"\n      \n      \n"
