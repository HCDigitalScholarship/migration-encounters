So we both helped each other out.\n \n \n   Anne: They're still in Arizona?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah, he's actually married to my mom. They got a house. I don't know\n   how they do it, but they're blessed. Good people, do good things, I feel\n   like you get blessed. Yeah, good karma just come back.\n \n \n  "
