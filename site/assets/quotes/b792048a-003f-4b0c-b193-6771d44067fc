  "text":"Anne: Did you make friends in school?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. You could say I was lucky because I was able to make friends and\n   I was able to adapt to their lifestyle and to their culture, but there's\n   other kids who had the same situation as me and they weren't able to adapt.\n   The Caucasian kids, they just didn't accept them\u2014as in, for me, they did\n   accept me. I don't know if it's because of the way that I was or my\n   personality, but I didn't have much trouble with that.\n \n \n   Juan: I did see that other kids who had the same situation as me, they\n   didn't get accepted because\u2014I don't know in that scenario what people\n   looked at or why it was that I was lucky to get accepted when others\n   didn't.\n \n \n   Anne: How about your brother?\n \n \n   Juan: My brother the same. I guess we were into sports, we played soccer,\n   we went to school activities. In a way that also helped us to be able to\n   adapt and to get along with other kids. I guess we didn't close our circles\n   or we weren't closed-minded, it was other worlds. We just wanted to learn\n   from the different culture. We didn't really struggle that much to adapt,\n   but then again, there's other people who do struggle.\n \n \n  "
