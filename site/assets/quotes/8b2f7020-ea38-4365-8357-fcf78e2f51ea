  "text":"Billy: Dude, a guy that's been in the U.S. his whole life just goes back to\n Mexico like that. It actually made me cry when I saw his first photo that\n he posted on Facebook. Him in Mexico. You could see that he's already been\n burnt by the sun and he's wearing these Mexican clothes. I'm like, \"Damn,\n my brother's in Mexico.\" That was tough for me, honestly.\n      \n      \n Anita: Did he use to wear that stuff in the U.S. too?\n      \n      \n Billy: No, I'm saying seeing him with these cheaper clothes. You've seen\n him with these, because here in Mexico they wear... It's not like over\n there. Over there it's easier to get quality. Over here it's a luxury. You\n know what I mean? So, I'm like, \"Damn, this dude is already... he looks\n Mexican, dude.\" It was crazy for me. And so, I'm like, \"Man, I can't leave\n my brother there. I'm going to go back.\" So, I saved them 200 bucks and I\n just took a plane here.\n      \n      \n"
