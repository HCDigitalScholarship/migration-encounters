  "text":"Mike: After that I got to the United States and I started going to school.\n   I didn't really know English, so that was kind of tough, but I picked it up\n   quick, because kids out there are just like\u2014or kids anywhere you know how\n   they could be. So yeah, I picked that up, started actually excelling in a\n   lot of classes, and that kind of was like the motivation to keep going\n   farther with my education.\n \n \n   Mike: I was doing really good. I was actually doing advanced classes, and\n   this was all from first grade onto middle school."
