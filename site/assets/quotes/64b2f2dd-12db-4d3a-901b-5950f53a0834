  "text":"Diana: Yeah. So then I'm here living with my dad now and then my dad work\n   all day. My older sister was living in the house with my dad too, but she\n   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to\n   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was\n   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she\n   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where\n   I left here. And at that moment I was like, no. So then I started just\n   being on my house and then I met my husband and then I got pregnant.\n \n \n  "
