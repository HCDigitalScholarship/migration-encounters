So, that's when I started working on the call center three\n   years ago. Three and a half years ago.\n \n \n   Anne: Do you enjoy it?\n \n \n   Many: It's cool. It's cool because I met a lot of people from the States,\n   they've been through almost the same situation like me. So, I feel\n   comfortable talking with people, they know how I feel. And I know how they\n   feel because, some of them, they have the same situation. Not exactly the\n   same, but almost the same. They left behind all parents, kids, their lives.\n   So I feel comfortable.\n \n \n  "
