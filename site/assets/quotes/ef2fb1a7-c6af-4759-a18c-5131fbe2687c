  "text":"Yair: I got to my uncle's house. No, I'm sorry. We got to this guy's house\n   in Texas. It was in Dallas, Texas. I can't remember what part exactly, but\n   we stayed over his house for four, three days, and the guy was really nice.\n   He actually had his family, his wife and kids. Most of the time ... I think\n   my mom, I can remember my mom left with this guy to see something about the\n   papers, or something like that, and she took one day. I didn't know\n   anything, and then I was really worried. Then my sister and me stayed at\n   this house with his wife and kids, but I didn't know anything about my mom.\n   I just kept asking for the latest on my mom, like \u201dHey, where's my mom?\n   Where's my mom?\"\n \n \n  "
