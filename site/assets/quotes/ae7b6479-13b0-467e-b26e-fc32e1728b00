  "text":"Luisa: Hard at first. I was bullied at first. I remember \u2026 because my\n   Spanish wasn't the best. When I got here, I had not practiced my Spanish in\n   so long. I knew how to read and write, but my grammar was not the best\n   either. I had kindergarten education. That's how long I [Chuckles] \u2026\n   everything else, a lot of my teachers were understanding. My literature\n   teacher was extremely understanding. I thank him for that. He was the one\n   that asked me to write and I wrote a short story about a sparrow getting\n   lost in the snow and then turning up in the jungle, and the sparrow makes\n   friends with all the cockatoos and the snake and the anaconda and they're\n   all bros and he learns to speak their language\u2014not very well, but he\n   learns.\n \n \n  "
