  "text":"Anne: Just one more... Couple more things about school. So you came back to\n   Arizona after two years of being kidnapped? Did someone give you some\n   therapy. I mean did you go through therapy or counseling at this time?\n \n \n   Mike: We weren't from there, so we didn't get any of that. I remember my\n   mom signed us up for this Christmas thing, because we didn't have any\n   money. And this was before I got kidnapped. She signed us up for this\n   little Christmas thing and we weren't accepted, because we weren't from\n   there. From the United States. So that program didn't apply to us, they\n   said.\n \n \n   Anne: But your school should have. I mean\u2014\n \n \n   Mike: Exactly. Exactly that's what I'm saying."
