  "text":"Axel: We were getting, the apartment where we lived, we were getting a good\n discount and then my mom was working a night shift or... no, wait. She was\n doing morning shift in the mall. My dad and my mom would get off around the\n same time. That was never really an issue with them. But once she got\n divorced and she got with my stepdad, she stopped working. She just focused\n more on with me, she got pregnant and started having my sister, and after\n that, she just focused more on being a housewife. Being a housewife, being\n a house mom.\n      \n      \n Axel: She did great. She kept herself real busy and she always worried a\n lot about us, tried to give us everything we needed for school, for food,\n dress wise. Anything we needed. She did what she could with what my stepdad\n would provide her.\n      \n      \n"
