  "text":"Miguel: Maybe yeah Thanksgiving and things we would celebrate. But I've\n   never celebrated Thanksgiving with an American family. Just with my family\n   and maybe we do things differently than they do. And being able to go with\n   their family, he even bought an RV and we drove down to his son's house and\n   his family and his mother-in-law and their family. And I mean you can\n   imagine they had a big house, a great house and I was like the only colored\n   person there. And nobody treated me differently. Everybody was like, \"Hey\n   man, go ahead and eat, and you want a beer?\u201d And you have the crazy uncle\n   here like, \"hey, come over here, do you know any pretty girls?\" I was just\n   like, \"Oh, I might.\n \n \n   Miguel: Getting to communicate with them, how do you say it\u2026 getting to\n   hang out with them and do more with their family was like actually helped\n   me a lot as well learn the culture a little bit more than how it is but it\n   was great. Fourth of July days were like let's go buy fireworks let's go to\n   Vancouver and buy tons of fireworks and go back to Portland and light them\n   up, illegal fireworks and barbecues. Like my family, literally my mom my\n   dad my uncles my brothers. My family was starting to get involved more too\n   with her family. They were starting to meet each other.\n \n \n  "
