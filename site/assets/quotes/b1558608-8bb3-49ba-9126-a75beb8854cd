  "text":"Rocio: And my daughter was 13 and of course she was in middle school and I\n   told her, \u201cNo, you need to stay over there and finish your school. You have\n   your dad.\u201d Of course, after three or four years, she began to not behave,\n   you know, and she didn't finish high school. She just finished second. She\n   just left one year, but she didn't finish and she started having problems\n   with behavior, living with friends, and I didn't know anything. Her dad\n   can't control her. So it was very hard for me. Very, very hard for me. Even\n   though my son started peeing the bed for two or three years, my friend\n   needs to take him to a psychologist. Saturday he turns 12, but he's 12\n   years old. We talked with him and try to explain to him, but he really\n   don't understand why I cannot cross the border. Why he cannot come over\n   here because it's hard for him to cross without me. And of course he's\n   still having problems sometimes with behavior or gain weight or lose weight\n   or depression.\n \n \n  "
