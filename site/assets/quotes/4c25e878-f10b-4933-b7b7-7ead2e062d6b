  "text":"Jeimmy: I have like cousins, siblings, that they're 14, 15 years old and\n   they already had kids. They have a horrible life because they can barely\n   get a job, they can barely feed their kids. I don't know for what reason.\n   For them, it was urgent to just get pregnant. So, that's not general, but\n   at least that's what I've noticed here in Mexico: that the majority of\n   teenage girls just want to get pregnant as soon as possible.\n \n \n  "
