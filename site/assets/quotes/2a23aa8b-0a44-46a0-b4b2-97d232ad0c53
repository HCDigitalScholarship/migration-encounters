  "text":"Edgar: Yeah, yeah. Yeah, I got into, I went to the job of plumbing. I got\n   into plumbing with my uncle. He helped me try to learn plumbing. And then,\n   started working. And then, I just started hanging out with my friends a\n   lot, smoking weed, drinking, doing bad stuff.\n \n \n   Anne: So that wasn't very good for your job.\n \n \n   Edgar: No, not really. So then, after two years, I quit and just started\n   hanging out every day. Making money out of weed, too.\n \n \n   Anne: Selling weed?\n \n \n   Edgar: Yeah. Yeah, pretty much.\n \n \n   Anne: Were you in a gang?\n \n \n   Edgar: No, never. But I did have a lot of friends that were in a gang. But\n   I never really got into that at all.\n \n \n   Anne: Okay. So you were selling weed and that's how you were supporting\n   yourself?\n \n \n   Edgar: Yeah. That and my brother just would give me...whenever he could, he\n   would give me money. He was working in a restaurant in Palo Alto. And,\n   yeah. He would help me out. Whenever I told him I needed money, he would\n   give it to me.\n \n \n  "
