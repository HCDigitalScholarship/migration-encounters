One time I remember my friend went into a gas station and\n   stole some cigarettes, which is\u2014how do you grab the cigarettes in the back\n   counter? And I was with that guy. Fights. I also loved fighting. It's just\n   a way of me just getting my anger out.\n \n \n   Mike: I got a lot of disorderly conducts and it was for fighting. It's just\n   something about fighting that just releases the stress. It just releases my\n   anger.
