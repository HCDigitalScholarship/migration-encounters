  "text":"Ruben: Now those that come here, I try to tell them. I try to give them\n   knowledge that people here are different. People that are 60 and up, they\n   don't like us. Some of them are grouchy when you say, \"Hey, buenas tardes\",\n   they look at you like \"What's good about?\" but they have to get to like\n   you. There's a lady right here who has been living 50 years. She was like,\n   \"You're the first-\" she calls us cholos- \"You're the first cholo that I\n   actually can say, Hey, that guy's nice.\" She tells me, \"Hey, can you clean\n   up my garden?\" I clean it up, put water on it, and she's happy, and she'll\n   say \"How come you never charge us for what you do for us?\"\n \n \n  "
