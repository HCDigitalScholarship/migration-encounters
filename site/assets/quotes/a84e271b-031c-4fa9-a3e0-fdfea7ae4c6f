  "text":"Juan: I started a real estate investing business. I was buying and selling\n   houses. I was fixing them and remodeling them and I was selling them to\n   people that were looking to buy a house for the first time. And I was doing\n   quite well until I couldn't do it anymore because, since I was\n   undocumented, I couldn't renew my driver's license. And when you don't have\n   a license in the state of Texas, pretty much you can't do anything. You\n   cannot travel, you cannot open a bank account, you cannot do pretty much\n   anything. You can't go to a bank and do anything because you don't have\n   identification. And the worst part was that in my business I needed to\n   notarize documents, I needed to borrow money from banks to purchase the\n   houses, and I needed a credit card to buy my materials to remodel my houses\n   and all that stuff. And since I didn't have anything like that, I couldn't\n   do nothing anymore, absolutely nothing. And it was a very, very hard time\n   for like a year that I couldn't do nothing because I didn't have an\n   identification.\n \n \n  "
