  "text":"Rocio: Dating, they just call immigration and my nightmare starts and my\n   life just was over, because I lost everything. Thank God my kids weren't\n   with me that day. My daughter was with her dad and my son was with a friend\n   of mine. So they took me just by myself. But that's when everything\n   started. I didn't come to Mexico for 18 years. So it was just a nightmare.\n   That's when everything started.\n \n \n  "
