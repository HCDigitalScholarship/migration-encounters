  "text":"Anita: Sixteen years. So, let's stop for a second. You said you were afraid\n   of US authorities. Tell me a little bit about that.\n \n \n   Melani: I was afraid because from a young age\u2014well, I really never knew\n   that I was undocumented until I was eight, and my parents told me that I\n   shouldn't be telling people about my family or if we're from Mexico. They\n   kind of made me feel that I should be ashamed to be from here because\n   everybody in society made you feel like that. And they told me that I had\n   to be really careful who I talked to and what I say, since the authorities\n   might come and get my parents.\n \n \n   They told me never ... if they ask you to tell them that you're from here\n   and your family's from here just avoid the question. I said yes, but I\n   really never understood why until I would see deportations -- my family's\n   friends getting deported and going through a lot of problems. Even for\n   simple stuff like driving and just getting stopped for a light that was off\n   or running a speed light or something, something that a regular citizen\n   would do and nothing would really happen, but we would have it harder than\n   them.\n \n \n   I would always be scared, even at school, to even say that I was from\n   Mexico or that my parents were from there or that we didn't have the same\n   opportunities as them because they wouldn't understand, \"Why can't you go\n   to the hospital?\" Or, \"Why can't you apply for certain things, government\n   things?\" And I couldn't apply for stuff like that because I knew I was\n   undocumented. So I would be scared to say so, and I would feel like the\n   authorities ... If anything happened to any Hispanic or me or my family,\n   the authorities would never respond, would never do anything because we\n   weren't citizens and they would care less what happened to us. [Pause] like\n   they say, we're like the modern slaves [Affirmative sound].\n \n \n  "
