  "text":"Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And\n   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of\n   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be\u2013 because also\n   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,\n   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff\n   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.\n   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.\n \n \n  "
