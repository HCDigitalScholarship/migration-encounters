  "text":"Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And\n so, all these people running around\u2014they're running around the monument\n right now\u2014laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people\n laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go\n to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those\n are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All\n these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses\n are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait\n until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they\n catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there\u2019s gotta be\n something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about\n any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest\n of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would\n probably save them a lot of money\u2014it'd probably save them more to get them\n home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to\n where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos\n that's going on right now.\n      \n      \n Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the\n families that they're breaking up.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can\n eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're\n here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems\n like it\u2019s not even in the equation.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's\n tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at\n individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they\n really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the\n judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,\n some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to\n me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where\u2026Just an\n example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a\n legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.\n      \n      \n Anne: He's a legal resident?\n      \n      \n Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known\n of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that\n have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.\n The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using\n the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track\n them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be\n picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy\n numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where\n they can go pick them up, they\u2019re not going to school here, going there.\n It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000\n people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go\n get them.\n      \n      \n Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.\n Just to say that \u201cWe're doing something.\u201d With 9/11, I remember that they,\n within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were\n attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?\n They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred\n Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that\n they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can\n deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the\n workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.\n That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten\n policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this\n done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we\n had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area\n at the time and they weren't bothering anybody\u2014it was hands off until they\n get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,\n then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.\n      \n      \n Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead\n of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.\n      \n      \n Anne: People can come and go.\n      \n      \n Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of\n somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could\n pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the\n US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do\n that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private\n business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to\n pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: You\u2019re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and\n paying them really?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,\n is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for\n migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a\n $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people\n wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house\n [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.\n      \n      \n Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the\n news.\n      \n      \n Anne: You\u2019ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider\n yourself an American? A Mexican?\n      \n      \n Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always\n felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there\n was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's\n what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not\n accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no\n paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a\n driver's license, getting my voter registration\u2014which is the main source of\n ID here\u2014the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.\n And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I\n needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It\n took me a few months.\n      \n      \n Anne: It's really too bad.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in\n the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.\n      \n      \n Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh, thank you\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think\n you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they\n seem really great.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh, I am, they're going, they're moving forward, that was the\n purpose of heading that "
