So, when I\n   got there, I was like, \"Hey, I like it here.\" [Chuckles]. When I got to\n   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able\n   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used\n   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,\n   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like\n   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from\n   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.\n \n \n  "
