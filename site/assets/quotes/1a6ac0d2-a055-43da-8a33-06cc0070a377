  "text":"Rodrigo: This is East Concourse Servicing. It's just a call center, but\n   it's a collision agency. I mean, it's pretty good. I wouldn't say, I don't\n   make a lot of money, but I'm getting there. It's close to my house. I will\n   be able to take him to school, and then he will have to go from school to\n   the house by himself. But I know that he went to the school. I know he will\n   be there, and I got time for him because I only work nine hours.\n \n \n   Anita: You work nine hours per day?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. From Monday to Friday.\n \n \n   Anita: What are you being paid?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, right now, the gross pay is $8,000. I mean, 8,000 pesos. I'm\n   sorry.\n \n \n   Anita: 8,000 pesos for ...\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Per month. Plus with that you have 2,000 pesos in vales de\n   despensa, that\u2019s what they call the food vouchers they give you.\n \n \n   Anita: Plus 2,000?\n \n \n   Rodrigo:\n \n \n   Per month. Plus a bonus that we could get. We could get from 2,000 probably\n   three or 4,000 more. All depends. And I mean, it's pretty good because I\n   got time to spend with him on the weekends. He's getting older already. I\n   mean, he's not a boy anymore. He's growing up, so I have to take care of\n   more of him. I have to be more time with him.\n \n \n  "
