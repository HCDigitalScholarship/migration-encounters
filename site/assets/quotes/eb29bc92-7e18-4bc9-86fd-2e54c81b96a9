  "text":"Noe: Hmm. Getting to know more about my culture. That's one thing. I've\n   been reading a lot of books about Mexico. Not the culture right now, but\n   the culture of Mexico, Hispanic Mexico. Visiting the temples, to\n   Teotihuacan, have you been there? Those are not, they're pyramids, but it's\n   called temples. The temples, there's a lot of things. For example, there's\n   a lot of history on my little village that used to be home of the Aztecs.\n \n \n  "
