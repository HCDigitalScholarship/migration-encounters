  "text":"Brenda: My parents got together when they were pretty young, not that\n young, but pretty young. My mom was like eighteen, nineteen. My dad was\n nineteen, twenty, and so my dad always instilled like a lot of fear like,\n \u201cYou better never get pregnant, you better not whatever.\u201d There was never\n any discussion of like what I was supposed to do to avoid getting pregnant,\n but it was just in my head. It's always been like, \u201cAll right my parents\n said not to do that so I'm not going to do it.\u201d But I think sometimes it's\n just that it's like, \u201cwhat else are you going to do,\u201d or \u201chow else do you\n progress into being a woman\u201d unfortunately like other than with a child or\n with a partner even though it's by mistake.\n      \n      \n"
