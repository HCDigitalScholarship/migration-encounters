  "text":"Joana: I want to have a career. Now that I can, that I actually have the\n   opportunity. Because in the United States, it was just like, \"Why do I even\n   try? Why do I even bother? I mean, at the end of the day, I'm not going to\n   actually be what I want.\" The thing is, the education, it's really high in\n   the United States; it's way better than here in Mexico. Here in Mexico it's\n   just like, \"Oh, well, you've got to learn this. You've got to learn that.\"\n   I mean, I feel like I would have a lot of trouble here because I mainly\n   will understand more in English than Spanish. So, if they're talking about\n   laws or they're talking about this or that, I kind of get a lot confused.\n   Not a little bit, a lot. It's like, \"Oh my God.\u201d I don't even understand\n   what they're saying. I don't get a lot of professional terms. I don't\n   understand them at all. My co-workers, if I don't understand something in\n   Spanish, they'll be like, \"Oh, it's this.\" It's like, \"Oh, okay, okay. I\n   get it now.\"\n \n \n  "
