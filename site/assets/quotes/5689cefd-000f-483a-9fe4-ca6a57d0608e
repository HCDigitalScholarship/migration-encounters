  "text":"I could say I do have a couple of family members,\n   but I don't feel comfortable, or the need to go and ask for a handout. My\n   mom was never like that, she would always be like, \"Work for your own\n   things and do it for yourself.\" It's really hard. I do have a couple of\n   family members that do that, and are like, \"Well put me here.\" Or, \" I want\n   to be in this position because I'm your cousin. I'm related to you in some\n   sort of way.\" But we're not like that. I don't know if we were raised\n   differently or we saw different things in the States that it\u2019s not really\n   plausible to do that in the States. [Chuckles] There may be a couple of\n   cases where that has happened but there's a lot of more open opportunities\n   in the States so it would be probably that.\n \n \n  "
