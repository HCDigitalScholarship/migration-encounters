Let&#39;s start off maybe back at the beginning. Could you tell me a little bit about how you came to migrate from Mexico to the U.S.? How old were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was actually five years old. I was five years old. So, it wasn&#39;t really my decision. My father was looking for something better for us. So, he took the decision to actually go to the United States. Don&#39;t know much of how it happened. All I remember is that I was in a car, and I crossed the border like normal. I just remember him saying act like an American citizen. [Chuckles]. I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; He bought me a happy meal, some glasses, and new clothes. He was just like, &quot;Don&#39;t say anything. You&#39;re an American citizen.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just play it cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just play it cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any memories of that first day in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, because after crossing the border we went to a hotel. It was a hotel. It was actually pretty dirty. I just remember meeting up with my mom, because I&#39;m not sure how she crossed. I just remember we met up crossing the border, and then we stayed at a hotel for one day. A car came for us, and then that car took us to the airport. We took a plane to Atlanta, Georgia. That&#39;s where we stayed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So Atlanta is where you grew up?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;First year in Alabama. Next year South Carolina, Columbia. And then Atlanta, Georgia.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, all over the South. Yeah, I can hear it in your accent, that southern accent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I liked the city. I liked the most with Atlanta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Atlanta.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a big city. Very nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day at school in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it&#39;s pretty sad, because I didn&#39;t know English. So, I didn&#39;t know how to communicate with anyone. Then I wanted to ask for my lunch at the cafeteria. I had a cousin that speaked English, and I told her if she could help me ask for my lunch. She was like, &quot;You&#39;ll need to learn someday. So start now.&quot; I started crying, because I was six years old, and I didn&#39;t know what to do. Then one of the teachers knew Spanish. So she came to me and said, &quot;Why are you crying?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I don&#39;t know. I just can&#39;t ask for my food.&quot; She was like, &quot;I&#39;ll ask for it,&quot; and she helped me a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so scary as a six-year-old. Did you feel disoriented or lost being in a place where you don&#39;t know the language?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I didn&#39;t know really what to do, but I think that helped me a lot. That&#39;s what inspired me to learn quicker, but yeah, it was hard at first.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about middle school, high school? What were your friends like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the people that are over there, they start hanging out with other people from South America or Mexico, but I was actually opposite. I used to like hanging out with all type of people. I had people from all over, because mostly I like rock people. I&#39;ve always liked rock music, so I used to get along with all type of people. Not just Mexicans.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You have kind of a rock music look to you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah middle school, I think that&#39;s my favorite part of everything that I&#39;ve studied. Middle school was the best.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I liked middle school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of people hate middle school. What was it about middle school that you liked?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers, they were pretty nice. I used to take classes. I don&#39;t remember quite how they call them, but they were like advanced placement classes. The people that were there were really nice. They were really focused on what they wanted to do. So that&#39;s what I liked about middle school. I got along with everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then high school, I liked it, but right now I notice that I could have done more things. I was kind of getting into the zone with the people, hanging out, and skipping school, and stuff like that. So, my favorite was middle school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school things are still good?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, things were still good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there gangs at your high school or things like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, middle school and high school</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Middle school, too.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the neighborhood where I used to live at. A lot of gangs. Usually they used to invite me. Never got into that. Didn&#39;t really like it, but they used to invite me. They never actually did anything to me, because I used to talk to them, and they used to know me. So, they never did anything to me. But yeah, there was a lot of gangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have friends that ended up in gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, most of my friends ended up in gangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of them.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they&#39;re still there. They&#39;re actually still living in the United States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of your friends?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Yeah, they&#39;re all in gangs, but I think most of them stopped or I&#39;m not sure what happened. They maybe moved to another place, but they looked like they were doing good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think it was that you were able to resist joining a gang when a lot of other people did?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t like doing things that everyone does. I like doing things that I like to do. My dad&#39;s always telling me not to&hellip;to think twice before doing something. So, as they soon as they mentioned it, I wasn&#39;t really interested. It was like let&#39;s say how do you say it? Something that everyone was doing at the time. So, I wasn&#39;t interested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t want to just follow the crowd.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. Yeah, and apart from that, it was just really stupid. All you do is get into trouble, and what I think is if it&#39;s not your country, then you just do the right things so that you don&#39;t get in trouble.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s interesting how you said it&#39;s not your country, you&#39;re living in someone else&#39;s country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s how it seems, because sometimes a lot of things that you want to you cannot do, because you&#39;re not an American citizen. So, if you&#39;re living there, just do the right things. Study. If you&#39;re doing school, just do good in school. If you&#39;re working, just work. But don&#39;t get into trouble. There&#39;s no reason to do that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like you have to be more on your best behavior compared to maybe your friends who are citizens?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I felt that way. I felt that way, because when I came here to Mexico, everything changed. I think I felt a little bit more freedom, but that&#39;s a good thing and bad thing, because when you have more freedom or you think you have more freedom, you start doing things that you&#39;re not supposed to do like maybe drinking in the streets. Nothing bad. I never did anything bad, but you do things that you didn&#39;t do over there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s interesting. How old were you when you came back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16 years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you keep going to school here in Mexico when you came back?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just finished high school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Finished high school. How was your Mexican high school different from your high school in the states?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s the main part why I didn&#39;t keep studying. When I used to study in the United States, it was completely different. They actually focused on what you liked, and they gave you opportunities on everything you liked. For example, I like playing soccer. So I used to be on the middle school team, high school team, and they always gave me chances. Playing helped me a lot, and they were already taking me little by little and telling me, &quot;If you keep doing this, why could apply for something.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to play the trumpet over there as well. I was in the school band, and here they just focus on, &quot;Okay, you have to learn,&quot; but they don&#39;t really focus on what you like. They just take you straight what they think is right, and in the United States it&#39;s completely different. They actually look at you, see what you&#39;re good at, and then they start helping you with that and growing. So, that&#39;s what I liked. I think if I would have stayed there, I would have kept studying.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you would have studied if you stayed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like what is it called? Informatics, computer, system engineer. System engineer. Yeah, that&#39;s what I would have liked. System engineer and maybe something else, kept with music or with sports.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you see yourself studying those things in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right now no, but that&#39;s the plan. I&#39;m trying to find a school online, because I have to work now. So, I don&#39;t have much time. I want to use the time I do have, but maybe online so I&#39;ll have more time to do my stuff as well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you want to do for your career?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Career?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;System engineer and try to find ... I personally like having my own business. I don&#39;t like working for someone else. So, obviously start working for someone else, learn the product, learn something, and then do something on my own. I&#39;m not sure. Maybe computer place where I can fix computers or help them install programs or whatever. Just something on my own.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you mentioned music, too. Would you be able to tie music into that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That would be fun. Yeah, I like playing the guitar right now. So yes, that would be fun. Maybe also studying something that has to do more with electronics. Maybe robotics or something, and yeah, get music into that. Build my own little system there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like audio engineering, sound engineer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Audio engineer would be nice, too. All of that, yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite thing to play on the guitar?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Metal, really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like metal. I like old school. I like everything, but playing on the guitar, definitely stuff like that more to jam with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;d be cool to see if we could have you come in another day and play your guitar or something. It&#39;d be cool to get a picture of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s backtrack for just a second. Let&#39;s see. You were 16 when you left the U.S., came back to Mexico. Why did that happen?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandmother died. She passed away. So, my grandfather was alone. My dad took the decision to come back and take care of him, and I wanted to play soccer. Over here, there&#39;s a lot of schools for soccer, but we noticed afterwards that the schools here, they&#39;re just looking for money. They don&#39;t really help you to grow in your sport or whatever you like. They&#39;re just looking for money. So, I came here. I was really excited, because I wanted to be a professional player. But no, it&#39;s really hard over here. They&#39;re just looking for money, but when we came back it was really hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We came in a van, and we took all our stuff. We left so there wasn&#39;t any problems, but the people notice that you&#39;re coming back from the United States. So, we got stopped four times by the police.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Once you were on the Mexican side?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or on the U.S. side?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The Mexican side. Four times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did the police say when they stopped you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That the van wasn&#39;t legal here, but we had the paperwork. Everything was done before we came back. We showed them the paperwork, and he said that was false paperwork. So, he had to take the van with him. Then they&#39;re just looking for money basically. We had to give him I would say $100, and then we got stopped again. They said that no, that what is it called? The one on the back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The registration or-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The one that&#39;s on the back of the car. Your license.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, the license plate.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;License plate, yeah. That that wasn&#39;t legal. So, just a bunch of excuses that weren&#39;t true, but they were just looking for money, because they know you have dollars.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did the license plate have U.S. plates on it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it still had U.S. plates.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they knew they could get money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then we had the big trailer on the back with all our stuff that we bought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were the other kids like? You told me about how school was different here, but I&#39;m curious about your classmates in Mexico compared to in the U.S.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in the U.S. since I took advanced placement classes, they were all really nice. Most of them just went to study and do their thing. So, that was good. Then the other friends I had maybe in the cafeteria and stuff, all of them were just pretty cool. What I did notice in the United States is everyone had their little crew. Like rockers, then there was the guys that liked doing sports, and then the girls that more don&#39;t like doing much things, just talking about clothes and stuff like that. Here, there is little crews, but not much. Everyone talks to everyone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Problem about people here, they&#39;re notice that you&#39;re from over there. So people here are really ... Not sure how to describe it, but they just like messing with people. They like getting them mad. So, they notice you&#39;re from over there, and you come here with another type of mentality, you just want to study and go home and do your things. No, they&#39;re just messing with you and stuff like that. You have to one day just say stop and probably get in a fight so they can just stop messing with you, and they&#39;ll know, &quot;No, don&#39;t tell him anything, because he&#39;ll get in a fight with you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would they do to mess with you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Call you nicknames or say stuff about your accent, because you have a total different accent when you come here. Right now I don&#39;t, but I used to have a weird accent. I didn&#39;t know how to speak that much. You have different clothes. You wear different clothes than them. So, they&#39;ll just see everything, and one little thing they&#39;ll start messing with you. Right now I just take it like it&#39;s funny, but back then it was like, &quot;No, just stop it.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it hard to make friends because of those differences?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, one of my first friends was one of the guys that they messed with a lot. I think we had that in common, so we used to talk. But then-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was he also coming back from the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, he was just a little bit weird. He was just on his thing. I don&#39;t know. So yeah, they messed with him a lot, and he was one of my friends. One of my first friends. Then you start adapting, and then you start making friends all over the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the hardest part about coming back to Mexico after being away for so long?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Adapting to the type of school here. I just don&#39;t like it. I never liked it. And right now I don&#39;t think it&#39;s that bad. I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dangerous, but when I got here, I thought it was really dangerous, because I used to go out, and the streets were all quiet. Then out of nowhere some guy living in the streets just came out and asked you for money. Right now it&#39;s normal. I just go, &quot;No, I don&#39;t have any,&quot; or I&#39;ll give him something. But back then adapting to all that, it was really hard. I didn&#39;t want to go out for about the first six months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were scared to be out on the streets alone.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here it&#39;s pretty nice, though, but where I live at, it&#39;s considered one of the most dangerous of Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which neighborhood is it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s called Ecatepec. It&#39;s right on the outside. It&#39;s like the border of Mexico City, and then it&#39;s another city. Yeah, they consider it really dangerous, but I&#39;m used to it. So I don&#39;t think it&#39;s dangerous.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just at first when-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first it&#39;s scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... it was new to you, you were scared.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was really scary.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that there&#39;s anything that the Mexican government could be doing to help return migrant families like yours?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. In my case, I have two sisters that are American citizens. In my case, I think all the time that I was in the United States, I did everything I was supposed to do. It would be nice maybe so they could do a program just to just go visit all your friends that you left there, because most of my life was over there. It would be nice just to have maybe permission or something that they could give us just to-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be able to go-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... go over there and visit friends. Or it would be great if a type of program. I&#39;m not sure if it&#39;s true, but I heard of a program in Canada where they get people from here and then they take them to work. I&#39;m not sure how it works, but it would be nice if they can do something like that. I don&#39;t know. If some company needs urgently someone to work, then that would be nice.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did all of your family come back to Mexico? Or do you still have family member in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still have uncles, cousins, quite a lot of people there. But my main family, my mom, my dad, sisters, yeah, we all came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But your uncles and cousins-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re still there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You haven&#39;t been able to see them since you left? Or have they come to visit?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They came to visit about two years ago. Just my cousin, because she&#39;s an American citizen. So, she came to visit, but the rest, no, I haven&#39;t seen them. I saw my uncle about three years ago, but he was deported. He was deported, so we accepted him in my house. He stayed there for about a month, and then he went back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Went back to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he didn&#39;t do that much. He was just not sure what happened. He had a little problem with some guy, so he got in a fight. They noticed he wasn&#39;t an American citizen. So they deported him.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like for him do you think coming back here after being deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it was horrible, because he had his son, his daughters, everyone was there, his wife. It was really hard for him. I could tell in his face he just looked depressed, and he suffered a stroke here. I think because of all the stress he suffered a stroke here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is he okay now?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was just like a pre-stroke. I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s called. Then we took him to the doctor. He came back. He was like, &quot;Oh, this stress is just killing me.&quot; But now he&#39;s happy. He&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he went back to be with his family?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he had to. There&#39;s just too many of them. If all of them would come back here, it&#39;s going to be really hard for him because just the what is it called? Like what you earn here weekly or monthly. It&#39;s not enough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s not the same.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not the same, and it&#39;s really hard. He has a big family. So, he had to go back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I bet that was really hard for him being away from his kids.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was. It was about two months, one month. A month and a half. And he suffered a stroke. He didn&#39;t have insurance here for the hospital. So, it was actually going to come out really expensive, but my dad, I&#39;m not sure what he was able to do with his. So, he was able to help him out. So, that&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, good. Did you ever have insurance when you were in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, never. I don&#39;t think so. I broke my hand in the United States. There was type of help. Not sure what is called. I was 13, 12 years old. From everything from the ambulance and everything they did, it was about $20,000 I think, but they helped us pay that. I&#39;m not sure what my dad did, but they helped us pay that. The government.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Some kind of organization helped pay or-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure what it was called, but it&#39;s Peach Insurance or something. I&#39;m not sure what it was called, but it&#39;s like a medical help.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, well I&#39;m glad you got help, because that&#39;s a lot of money.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is, and they helped us out. He just had to pay like $400 out of all of that. That was it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you can think of one or two things, what was the best part about living in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All the activities. Well, as a kid, because now as an adult, I didn&#39;t have the chance to live there. But I would say as a kid, all the activities. You&#39;re occupied all day. So yeah, you don&#39;t have time to think about something bad or do bad things. You go to school, the bus picks you up, you go to school, you do your things. I was in the math club. I&#39;m not sure how it&#39;s called. We used to go-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like Mathletes?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, we used to go and just write down the equations. I used to do that. I was in the reading club. I&#39;m not sure. Then I was kind of like let&#39;s say a geek or a nerd back there, because I was in the school band. Used to play the trumpet. The only thing I did was soccer that was kind of an athlete thing. But yeah, that was the best part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you had the nerdy side, but then the rocker and music side and then soccer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after that, you go back, the bus takes you home, you go, you eat, and then I was doing karate back then as well. That&#39;s where I broke my hand. You were occupied all day, and it was fun because you met a lot of people from everywhere. All the cultures. It was really nice. I think that was the best part about the United States. They actually are focused on making you a good person. Here they don&#39;t care. They don&#39;t care if you&#39;re a good person or you end up bad. They don&#39;t really care.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the worst part about being in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The worst part? I actually liked most of it, but what I didn&#39;t like sometimes was that a lot of people are just in their houses with their computers. They don&#39;t like going out much as a kid. I used to be with my friends like, &quot;Let&#39;s go somewhere. Let&#39;s do something,&quot; and if it&#39;s not part of the activity that you&#39;re doing or the classes you&#39;re taking, then they don&#39;t like going out that much. They just like being on the video games. I didn&#39;t like video games that much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the other part&rsquo;s just that if you do one bad thing, it&#39;s possible that you end up back here. So, you&#39;re always kind of worried that something could happen and one day to another you&#39;re back here. Then you make your life there. Actually your house, your car, everything there. In my case, all my friends, everything I was doing, and the one day to another you lost it. Lose everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you don&#39;t know how much longer you&#39;ll have it. Is that a worry that was always in the back of your mind every day?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that was one. Then the other one was just out of nowhere my dad&#39;s going to be like, &quot;let&#39;s go back.&quot; Because he really missed his family, because he wasn&#39;t there. I had my family, but in the case of my grandma or my grandfather ... When my grandmother passed away, the first thing he said, &quot;It&#39;s not worth it. You have everything here. You have money, cars. We have everything, but you don&#39;t have family. So what&#39;s the point of being here when family is the main part of life?&quot; When my grandmother passed away, his mom, he was just really sad. He was just, &quot;I&#39;m out of here.&quot; Then one day to another we just came back.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you noticed do you feel like Mexican culture is more family-oriented than American culture?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, kind of it is. Because in my case, a little bit, because for some reason after my grandmother passed away, we all just went separate ways. But yes, Mexican families are really united all the time. I think American families are more just like Thanksgiving, Kristmas. Stuff like that. Here it&#39;s like every week they&#39;re together, and they&#39;re just drinking or doing something. But they&#39;re always together. And anyone has problems, then they&#39;re all there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my case, I have a wife. We separated about two months ago.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no problem. Their family was just really united all the time. Mines isn&#39;t, but when we see each other, we enjoy it. We just have a lot of things to do. We can&#39;t be together all the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, it seems like you&#39;re still a very tight-knit family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any kids with your wife?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two kids. Do they live with her?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they live with her. I actually-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you get to see them?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... get to see them today. Today, and they stay with me Saturday and Sunday. Then I take them home.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you get them for the whole weekend.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Whole weekend, and the weekends I don&#39;t have them, I get to see them on my days off, which is Mondays or Tuesdays.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, that&#39;s great. How old are they?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and four. They&#39;re little.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are their names?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jamie and Hailey.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are they both girls?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Both girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What time do you get to pick them up today?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s going to leave them at my house. So I&#39;ll get there, and they&#39;re there at 7:00. I get there at 8:30.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Aww. Well, that&#39;s exciting.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is. Yeah, I&#39;m excited to see them. Tomorrow&#39;s my birthday, so that&#39;s why I told her let them stay with me this week.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I&#39;m glad they&#39;ll be there for your birthday. It seems like you&#39;ve got a really good family. Do you have a good relationship with your mom and dad?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Back then when I was younger, it&#39;s just like normal problems. &quot;Don&#39;t go out. Don&#39;t do this. Don&#39;t do that,&quot; but right now when I&#39;m a little bit older, don&#39;t cause then much trouble. I just get home from work. My mom&#39;s acting really nice, because she noticed I was kind of depressed a little bit because of everything that happened.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the separation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So she&#39;s acting really nice. She&#39;s helping me a lot. Her and my dad, they&#39;re speaking. Every morning they get up, they start talking to me. &quot;Don&#39;t be sad. Just live life.&quot; He speaks a little bit of English. Sometimes he speaks to me in English. Like, &quot;Don&#39;t be sad, bro.&quot; He pulls out the curtain, because my room is like this, and it has some curtains. He just looks in there, &quot;Don&#39;t be sad.&quot; Because on my days off, if past 9:00 if I&#39;m still in bed, it&#39;s because I&#39;m sad or something.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s good. I&#39;m glad you&#39;ve got them looking out for you. They sound sweet.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite thing about Mexico, being back in Mexico? What&#39;s been the best part?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s always somewhere, a place to visit. There&#39;s always something to do. Activity-wise, like I mentioned over there it was great, but here it&#39;s just like if you&#39;re bored one day, there&#39;s always somewhere you haven&#39;t went. If it&#39;s another city or within Mexico City, there&#39;s always something to do. That&#39;s what I like a lot, and I like walking. Don&#39;t like using much car, and I just like going out here and just walk all over the place.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a beautiful city for walking around. I love it. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s what I like about Mexico most. All the places like outside cities like [Chiapas 00:28:25]. The beaches are pretty nice. Cancun. I like all that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of cool places to visit in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like you could travel around Mexico for years and years and still not see everything there is to see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s true. Last nine years I&#39;ve been here I visited a lot of places, but there&#39;s still tons more to visit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still more.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But not enough money. If I had enough money, I would be there already.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have one main last question for you. Do you consider yourself only Mexican? Or do you consider yourself American, too? Both? Neither?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Personally, I consider myself more Mexican, but I do have the American culture. For example, when I was with my mom&#39;s kids, she likes a lot Mexican food. I still love American food and Mexican food, but I like burgers. I like pizzas. I like all that. They&#39;re not particularly American, but that&#39;s mostly what they sell there. So, we used to go out. I used to be like, &quot;Let&#39;s go get some wings,&quot; and she was like, &quot;No, I want some tacos.&quot; &quot;But no, we ate tacos last week. Let&#39;s get some wings.&quot; A lot of that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I still like celebrating Thanksgiving at my house. Nobody does it in Mexico, but I like doing it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you the one to cook the turkey?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, because she still knows. I just go, &quot;Hey, I give you for the turkey, and then you&#39;ll make it.&quot; Then she&#39;s like, &quot;All right.&quot; We still like talking about when we used to live there. We miss the buffets there. They&#39;re awesome. Yeah, we still have a lot of things that we do that we used to do there that not a lot of people do here. Yeah, I would consider myself a little bit still American.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What percentage would you say? What percent Mexican? What percent American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Maybe 60/40, because a lot of people that are from here that never lived there, they do notice it. They&#39;re like, &quot;Hey, why do you do this? Why do you do that?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I used to do it over there.&quot; I&#39;m not going to stop doing it just because I don&#39;t live there. So, a lot of things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I noticed that a lot of people from here, they like playing soccer, but mostly their family never go see them. I remember when we used to be there, your cousins went, your mom went. Everyone went, and they&#39;re all cheering.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they come to the soccer game with the cooler, the chairs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The cooler, the chairs, the beers. Everything. That&#39;s something we still do right now. Because of my job, I&#39;m not playing. My dad, because he&#39;s a little bit older, he stopped playing, because he just hurts himself every time he plays. So, we still do that. We all go out, and when I play, they go and they take their chairs and their little what is it called? Tent. Little tent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they watch me. That&#39;s something we do that much people don&#39;t do. They don&#39;t do it here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s fun, though.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it is. Yeah, but 60/40.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;60/40. Good split. That American side is still a lot of who you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because when I was growing up, it was in the United States. So I think that&#39;s when you mostly learn, and that&#39;s when you actually make your personality. Since I was there, I think that&#39;s what happened. Because my dad liked rock music, but I don&#39;t think I would have liked it to this level if I wouldn&#39;t live there by staying out with all the rockers and punk kids. They used to skateboard. I never learned how to skateboard. I was horrible. So I just would listen to music with them, hang out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s one of the things, because a lot of people here, they like all type of music, but they&#39;re not focused in a certain genre.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not as much of that rock culture here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then here, you have me and my dad. That&#39;s all we like.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just you two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just us two. There&#39;s a lot of people here that like it, but it&#39;s kind of weird to see them. The only place you would see them is like in a festival, like metal festival. They&#39;re doing it every year now. That&#39;s something I&#39;m starting to like, and you&#39;ll see a lot of people like, &quot;Where did all these metal heads come from?&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They usually make it like 30 minutes away from here or in a city called Toluca. Toluca. That&#39;s a big place, and I think they use it for speed races, stuff like that. But that&#39;s where they do the festival. Knotfest. That&#39;s pretty good. I like it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah, that sounds like fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is there anything else that you want to share about yourself that I haven&#39;t asked or any last things that you want us to know about you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Kris:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think so. I think I covered it all. Personally myself, I didn&#39;t have such a hard experience from the United States coming back here luckily, but there&#39;s other people that suffered a lot. I&#39;m grateful for that, and that&#39;s a good thing that I never got deported. So, hopefully one day I get to visit my friends. Maybe a visa and hopefully go back there someday.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I hope so, too. I&#39;m going to go ahead and ...</span></p><p class="c0 c10"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c8"><span class="c5"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c14"><tbody><tr class="c6"><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p></td><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c4"><span class="c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
