So, first of all thank you so much for coming and speaking with us. Before we begin, I just wanted to say that I understand that sometimes talking about these experiences can be very difficult because it brings about certain emotions and feelings that you don&#39;t want to feel or relive again, but it&#39;s good to know how important your story is, and how important it is for people to hear it and understand the realities of migration and the human side of migration. Which is really what we&#39;re trying to do with this project, to shed light on that. So thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my first question for you is, why did you leave Mexico, and how did you cross the border?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I left Mexico because actually I was trying to get away from the cops. I wasn&#39;t trying to do any time. Now I did get paranoid, didn&#39;t really know what to do now. For me I did&hellip; I did aggravated assault, somebody that I actually ended up stabbing him. Now it was for...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before you left Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you in prison?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just, last year, 23.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. I&#39;m talking about leaving Mexico to the states.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s totally fine.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, wait, we&#39;re getting ahead of ourselves a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yes. Well, the reason that I left from Mexico to the United States is because I needed to reunite with my parents. Now my parents left me when I was about two years old, and then they had enough of me being by myself here with my grandparents, so they actually decided to take me back to the states. The reason they did that, they left to the States because my dad was working as a cop. He actually was one of the sheriffs back in ____. Everything was good. My dad is a person that always lives by certain standards, but the life... He had a kid already. He didn&rsquo;t want my life to be messed up in Mexico, seeing all the corruption, all the drug addictions. You get things easy out here, but not the correct things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, she didn&#39;t get an education. She comes from a native family. Now they speak, </span><span class="c0">[Nahuatl 00:02:32] that&#39;s her native language. It&#39;s not really espa&ntilde;ol [Spanish 00:02:34], it&#39;s [Nahuatl 00:02:36]. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">So, my moms, she knew she wasn&#39;t going to get nowhere in Mexico so she actually decided for those reasons to go back to the states. She actually went to school a couple of years, learned English, took Physics, regular high school learning areas. You know? When I went back it was so great. It was great for me. I actually learned English pretty quick. Now crossing the border as a young kid, that&#39;s a wild experience.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was five years old. Actually, my birthday was me crossing the border. That was my present gift. Now, my uncle, he carried me miles through the border. It was me, my uncle Saul and my uncle Juan. Now my uncle Saul, he was in the military. He was one of the trainers for martial arts. He carried me big time to the States. Now, the desert, well the border is really crazy. There is wild animals&hellip; we actually had to run from some animal. I don&#39;t really remember; it was a while back. My uncle didn&#39;t give us the best treatment, and actually they actually hit you. The border patrols will hit you. If you&#39;re a big guy and don&#39;t fit in the car, they will make you fit, and not by pushing you. They will grab their own guns and just hit you until you fit into the car.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We tried doing like 15 times. My parents they waste a lot of money for the three of us, and then one of them they left me in an abandoned house in the middle of Tijuana. Tijuana in an abandoned house just waiting for the immigration patrol car to leave the area. Now we didn&#39;t do that, we was there for three days. And I hadn&rsquo;t eaten, so my uncle decided to give us in. Just like, &quot;Let&#39;s go. You need to eat, you&#39;re not eating.&quot; Now, I was ready. I was locked up with them also for about two weeks in the immigration department. I wasn&#39;t really eating their food, anything. My uncle got jail, they say, &quot;If anything happens to me, they will actually incarcerate him for crossing me over.&quot; But they actually let us go because I was already like wasted. Like my body was giving up on me already. We stay in the hotel for another two weeks, eating and everything, and then my birthday was coming up, and luckily, we was able to cross that way. But this time I didn&#39;t cross with my uncles.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lady from the Arizona, we tried to do this time from Arizona. She wanted to pick me up with her son, and we just crossed on the border in the car, and they let us through like that. They had no papers. She said that she left it back at the house, she lost it. She came up with an excuse, but they let us through. My uncles this time, they was able to pass it, but they passed it through different areas, and we didn&#39;t do it together this time. I was in Arizona. I think I was at relative&rsquo;s house for about a week so my body will get better, then after that they just send me an airplane to Newark, New Jersey, and I saw my dad. The craziest thing about that is I couldn&#39;t even hug my dad. I couldn&#39;t hug him. Because for me, and they left me at two years old, I thought that my grandma and my grandpa, his parents, I thought those were my parents. So when I saw him, he was a stranger to me. And I told him, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to hug you.&quot; </span><span class="c0 c12">No te conozco</span><span class="c0">. [Spanish 00:06:25].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I told my uncle, &ldquo;No&rdquo;. &quot;That&#39;s your father, hug him. I let him know it&#39;s because, who leaves their son? And that&#39;s something that actually they grew up, and how are you going to leave your son? You don&#39;t do that to your own son. You struggle, and you struggle together. But now since I got a little bit older, I think there is certain sacrifices, even though... Let&#39;s say, those are going to hurt you more because it&#39;s going to, someday, you&#39;re going to be feeling... My parents could whip my behind all the time they want. That&#39;s something that&#39;s going to go away, but the thought of them leaving your kids, not even them are going to forget it in that situation, and all because of the border. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first day, I didn&#39;t come, I had all my clothes was left on the border. My dad, he wasted so much money. Me and my dad had to actually wear the same underwear. You know? That&#39;s how broke they was. And we was like that for three months, and then, they actually tried to help us out, but me and my dad actually had to wear the same clothes. But we actually started bonding like that. You know at that age you are like, &ldquo;man what the fuck is wrong with them.&rdquo; Like, you know? </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about your mom? How was it seeing your mom?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, I really didn&#39;t know her neither. I didn&#39;t know her neither, but when my mom was a bit more different, my mom, as soon as she saw me walk in the house, she went and started crying. She started crying. She hugged me. She didn&#39;t want to let me go, and she just wanted to be with me all night, just hugging me. Like, and the thing was, me, I was a shy kid at that age. They had me with one grandparent family to another grandparent family&hellip; My emotions at that time were so mixed up, I didn&#39;t know what was going on. But I grew attached to my Uncle Juan and Saul. I actually wanted to be with him all the time. They wanted to go to work, I wanted to go with them too. I didn&#39;t want to go to school, I just wanted to be with them because I feel out of place. Then I started going to school. I started seeing other kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The craziest things for me was seeing kids back in the States actually going by hand with their parents. Like, &quot;Oh, bye Ma. I&#39;ll see you later!&quot; I couldn&#39;t do that with my parents. I couldn&#39;t do that. So then my parents little by little just started getting to me. And then honestly, once I turned 13, that&#39;s when I actually started doing that with them. Like, &quot;Oh, Ma, &iquest;Como estas? I&#39;ll see you later Ma, take care.&quot; To my dad, &quot; I&#39;ll see you later Papi, take care.&quot; Once I was 13. Before that I wasn&#39;t doing none of that. I was more with my uncles then with them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My uncles actually moved out of the house. I ran. As soon as I saw the moving truck, and that they left, and they didn&#39;t tell me anything, I went running after the moving truck until I got them. Then the people in the street were like, &quot;Yo, that kid&#39;s running for you.&quot; They got me in the moving truck. They took me back to my parents. I got a butt whooping that day. I got a butt whooping that day, but it was worth it. It was worth it being over there, being with my family. My sisters!</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m so overprotective. When my sisters started being born, I was so overprotective with them. And the crazy thing is over there, always being the first child, they always used to leave me with the kids, always. Seven years old, eight years old, it don&#39;t matter. You&#39;re the grown person in the house, take care of them. You know? And it was really good. It&#39;s how I&#39;m being. Honestly, I never really saw my parents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad was working 14 years, two jobs, nine hours each job. He will only go, by the time he drove back home, he wanted to sleep three hours and go back. He was like that 14 years. And my mom also. My mom, she used to actually take the job in the evening, around 12:00, 10:00, so she could drop us off to school. And then my dad would come out of his other job, pick us up, drop us off quick at the house, go to his other job. That was our life for about 14 years. Then I started working, and then I told my mom and my dad, &quot; I don&#39;t really got to work.&quot; Because, when I was in middle school I got with a bad crew. I was in a preppy school first, and then I went to middle school where they was called more ghetto. So I started getting involved in gang activity. I never got down with a gang because for me that&#39;s not having </span><span class="c0 c12">cajones</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;you know. So I never did that, but I was moving drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was only 13. 13. I started doing all of that, and then I was </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 00:11:34]. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt3" id="cmnt_ref3">[c]</a></sup><span class="c0">Because, if the Black people&hellip; Over there, that time, it was Black versus Mexican. And it was back and forth, back and forth. So, it was like, nah man. Like, I did do my own crew. We did have our own crew, and then actually, I started fighting a lot, moving some couple things. At the end of the day, nobody really messed with me like that. Nobody disrespected me. Everybody used to talk to me with respect. But, no. It wasn&#39;t really respect. It was all fear all along. So, then, my life was like that, fighting, it was like a </span><span class="c0">[Can&rsquo;t distinguish 00:12:12] </span><sup><a href="#cmnt4" id="cmnt_ref4">[d]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">inside the middle school. And during that time, the African Americans, they didn&#39;t get suspended.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexicans used to get targeted a lot. We used to get suspended big time. So, a couple years ago, the principle from our school, Mr. Vorhees, he actually got caught selling drugs. They caught him with Marijuana, Heroin, Coke, everything. No wonder he had the African American kids&rsquo; backs. We knew there was something wrong because the ones that really controlled all the movement was the Spanish kids. We had control of everything. But other than that, when there was school, everything, one of our... Let&#39;s say, an example, one of my friends there, Phantasma, they killed him by a rival gang. He got killed. The school went crazy. So they went for me because they knew I was able to control the situation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old was your friend?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He was only 12 years old. 12 years old. He got stabbed about 17 times in the chest.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By other gang members of another gang?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. [gang]. [gang] He got stabbed. They was walking from the movie theaters back home with our other friend Pretty Boy. He also got stabbed. He got stabbed more times than my friend Phantasma. My friend, Pretty Boy, he got stabbed in the chest, in the back, and he survived. Now, vengeance came along. The point at the end where everything went down, we went and were getting everybody. I never really got involved in it. I was never really a person that uses weapons, but they did. We set&hellip; Well, they set them up in the hotel. They went to the hotel, and they started shooting the hotel up. Now, most of them are my family members from Guerrero and Sochi. They came back. They actually left from the cops because they was looking at doing 15 to life. So they did, they came over here. They ran out in Guerrero and Sochi.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my friend Pretty Boy, he&#39;s Peruvian for all situations going on over there. He actually is right now in Columbia. Now he settled down. He&#39;s actually a really nice guy. He was always about preaching the word of God, but certain things that make you get involved in that situation that you just follow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it only middle schoolers, or how did you get ahold of all the drugs and the weapons to do what you were doing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was with grown people too. It was like this, let&#39;s put the Pee Wees and then the OGs. The Pee Wees are like the teenagers, and then there&#39;s OGs, over 18. Those are the ones that always hooked us up. But just because you&#39;re a Pee Wee don&#39;t mean that they are not going to respect you. They actually do respect you. With the respect, how you get respect in there is how many stripes you get. Let&#39;s say if you in the streets walking, I would go up to you. That&#39;s how I would get another stripe. I would punch you because you from the rival gang. I see you just walking, doing anything, punch you, beat you up, stab you, whatever. The more things I do to you, the more stripes I get. And they be like [Inaudible 00:15:40]. He got steam, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are the stripes like tattoos? Do you have to get them marked on your body?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, me, I was never in that. I used to roll with them. I used to roll with them. That&#39;s because that&#39;s in the neighborhood I grew up in.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Why did you join the gang?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t I never joined it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were just affiliated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was affiliated because that&#39;s what the people... &nbsp;[gangs]. Yeah. Yeah. I grew up with them, so it was like, I have got to have their back. And every time I used to chill with them, problems went down, so I had their back. But the thing is, the other gang members, they really didn&#39;t mess with me like that because I was the type of person, if I see you getting beat up and I&#39;m with my homies from the block, if you 18, and I&#39;m </span><span class="c0 c12">trece</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;, and I&#39;m chilling with them, but you&#39;re walking alone, I&#39;m not going to let them touch you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to be like, you know what, Shoot the fade, one on one.

Now, bless you, bless you, bless you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry. 18 is [gang]?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah [gang]. And then, I used to be that type of person. That&#39;s why, because I used to also defend them. Now, if it was like 10 on 10, then you know, go ahead, do your thing. But if it&#39;s one, and I&#39;m with my friends, and I could stop it, then I used to be like, nah man, is you trying to get him? You my boys, but you know, with me man. You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you moved the drugs, did you move it for them, or did you do that just for yourself?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Myself. Myself. Actually, I wasn&#39;t able really to go to [name of high school], so I actually went to another preppy school. Now in this school man, I was seeing everybody. Most of the kids, they were actually making money. Well, they was making money, there was more... Their parents used to give them the money and all of that. So I was like, man, they have cars, they got all this. Man, I want it, but man, I don&#39;t got my papers. So I started hustling. When I used to move these products in one day, I used to make like... And I used to only do it Friday, Saturday, and Sunday, after 1:00 that the bars started closing. I used to start pushing some Coke, and I used to make like, 2000 to 3000.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a day?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like two days.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did your parents think like about that money, or what did you do to hide it from them, or what did you do with the money? I&#39;m actually curious about that too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used to go a lot to the beach with my friends. They have their own money. And we used to just do </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 00:18:30]. [Spanish 00:18:31].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt5" id="cmnt_ref5">[e]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;And we started just chilling with. And by the homegirls, the homeboys and all that just have different type of drugs. And just chill, have a good time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your parents know about the money that you were bringing in?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, they never knew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They never knew.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Until there was one point I told my mom. You know, &quot;Yeah. I sell. I make money. I don&#39;t ask you for anything.&quot; But just the same way I always made the money, the same way I always wasted the money. Always I&#39;d get enough to get some more. And that&#39;s because I met a Puerto Rican guy, and he actually hooked me up big time with that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With any drugs I wanted. Any drugs I wanted, so my boys started hitting me up, &quot;Man, you got this? You got that?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, I got it man.&quot; Or...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your supplier or something?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Or what used to happen, they say, &quot;If you got something, I got the Purple Kush, and you got the Reggie. You want to make your weed better.&quot; He would tell me, like, &quot;You know what? I&#39;m going to give you half of my Reggie. Give me half of it, and I&#39;m going to give you some actual cash.&quot; And I would just be like, &quot;Hey man. Here.&quot; Or some sense, it used to be the opposite way. I had the wack stuff and he had the good stuff. So, the opposite way, and we used to make things work by trading drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And by this point you were already working?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I was working already.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were you doing?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that moment, I was doing taxi.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which doing taxis, working a taxi... That&#39;s when I got my driver&#39;s license. That&#39;s when I got my driver&#39;s license. Once I got my driver&#39;s license, everything went way better for me because I started selling beers. After 2:00 in Jersey, they&#39;re not allowed to sell beers, so I started selling beers. Beers and Coke is a good matchup. It&#39;s a good match up because after 2:00, they would start calling you. And you get the 24 pack for about 27 dollars, and I was selling it for 50, the 24 pack. That plus the drugs, it was going well. And then I met another Mexican guy. This guy actually, I was driving him around doing some missions. He would actually give me a bowl of coke for free. Just like a bowl, like a bowl of soup. Just like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All with Coke.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With Coke. Just get as much as you want. And I used to get it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever use the drugs, or did you just sell them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used them. I used Coke. I&#39;d use Marijuana. Which Marijuana was the more relaxing one. Coke was like more like, you&#39;re up. It takes away the [Spanish 21:11]. And this and beers, and that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, while all of this was happening, you did apply for a DACA, and you were granted that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yes, I was granted.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">Can you tell me about DACA, about the process of your applying, how you got it, and what you used it for?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Now when I got DACA, I still did my share of all these things that were in DACA. But once I got DACA, I feel more relief, especially because my dad was like, you know what, you&#39;re doing good in school, you&#39;re doing this, you&#39;re getting your head up. I see you better. He be like, you know what? Let&#39;s go get you a brand-new car out of the dealer. And we went to get my brand-new car. That&#39;s when my life changed actually. I was like, man, my dad really busted his ass to do this. I&#39;m paying for it, but he&#39;s helping me out big time. And that&#39;s when my life changed. I was like, man, I need to do better, so I stopped. I got away from all of my friends. Just separated from everybody. I started doing good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You stopped selling all of the drugs.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, everything, everything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of DACA?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because of DACA. That changed my mind. It was like, during that time I was still doing it like a couple times when I had DACA, but my second year in DACA, it was like, you know, I can&#39;t do that shit no more. I&#39;m good, I got a good job, my dad hooked me up with cars, and my dad was the person like, you know what, you want another car, I&#39;ll just get you another car. It was car after car, after car, after car, after car, after car, after car. I used to switch cars every three months, every two months. I was living good, and I still have my favorite sports cars, my Nissan Altima. All customized man, and I was good 2015.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt6" id="cmnt_ref6">[f]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was it customized?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a special edition. The sports version, turbo, the rims.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have a photo?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I don&#39;t. And then, man, it was really nice, and then my dad, he would say, &quot;You know what, you want another car, let&#39;s go get it so you don&#39;t mess up your car.&quot; And I used to go, and I go, and then when the taxes started coming, when I was able to reclaim my taxes, whoa, I went off. I went and started getting more cars. And then I started doing... I wasn&#39;t selling drugs no more, but you know, high school and the whole experience graduation.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were doing it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was doing that. I used to go with my friends to the beach, but this time it wasn&#39;t my homies, it was actually my friends from school. My homies was from the hood. This was friends from school, and it was good. We used to go party. We used to go to events, at the beach. All this fun stuff, and over there was with my homeboys, was more drugs than anything. Over here was like, you get a girl tonight, and you had fun, no one&#39;s fighting, nobody is looking for you, it&#39;s just, you&#39;re not having to have the party, but you are having something more fun, a fun experience for life. You know? And then, I was going to get into college and everything, but then, actually had landed a job in one of these companies that do petroleum machines that are able to understand, to handle under negative zero degrees. I was working in the company. I got that job like this in my Junior year.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you went to a technical vocational school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me about that too? Like what were you studying basically?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Well, I went to that school. I did first culinary arts, like with food and everything. I was actually good at that. I learned how to do pasta, pizza. I was, like, into that. It used to calm me down. It used to take all the stress from the streets. I used to take it all all day, and it was really fun. I used to meet people. Everybody was so goofy at that school man. Nobody ever really fought. They was so goofy, and when they used to fight, it was like for stuff like candy, stuff like that. It was not even serious, but it was really good, and then they actually used to have events like concerts and all of that, and they used to take to different events to see what the future could be. They used to take us to schools from Italy, Germany, culinary arts schools. Like, we would give you a scholarship if you are able to do this and that, and this and that. And actually, it was really good. They actually, they recommended me a couple times. But since I didn&#39;t have DACA at that moment still, I couldn&#39;t, my opportunities were limited.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt7" id="cmnt_ref7">[g]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then, my teacher, she was really a really funny lady, Mrs. _____. She used to be like, &quot;You fucking Spanish kids, always playing with that, what is it called, the lemon and the chicken man.&quot; And it was funny because that was her attitude. She was just funny. She owned actually a Mexican restaurant. She was an Italian lady, but she was so funny. That was her way of showing love to the kids, and that&#39;s how kids really respect her because when it came down, she actually used to have your back, like don&#39;t mess with him because you know sometimes they&#39;re really racial if you&#39;re not...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you&#39;re white you got it good actually. If you&#39;re black or Spanish like they kind of profile you in that area. But it was so good, but then I was like, &ldquo;you know what?&rdquo; I actually like cars. I want to learn how to fix cars. More body work than anything. I went to that, I got my certification, and it was great. I learned how to do a lot of things in that school. That school helped me out so much. My principle, he actually was giving me the opportunity to get a scholarship to go for guidance counselor. He said, &quot;You should do guidance counselor because you&#39;re experienced. You&#39;re actually able to associate with more kids. And since you&#39;re Spanish, you&#39;ll get paid double, and you&#39;re able to communicate with both races.&quot; but I was like, &quot;Nah I can&#39;t do that because I already had the other job.&quot; I had the other job that they hook me up with.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I was in that job, you was able to make up to a hundred thousand a year, plus they used to make you go to trips, like let&#39;s say to the North Pole, and stuff like that for the company to fix the machines. I only lasted in that job like a month, then my friend, Stalaga, he needed to sell his business. I was able to buy it because everything I did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was the business?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A restaurant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What type of restaurant?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Tex-Mex restaurant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how old were you when you acquired it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;18.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">Yeah, but I was able to buy it, but I didn&#39;t buy it. I convinced my mom to buy it. I was like, &quot;You know, Ma, you work so much man, why do you guys always got to work for people? Why don&#39;t you work for yourself you know?&quot; Because I&#39;m the type of person, if you got a skill, why not use that skill? But in our mind, it&#39;s like, you always got to work for somebody. So, I told my mom, &quot;Just do it man. Just buy it, buy it.&quot; He was selling it for 100 Gs, and we took it down to 24 because he needed the money. I was doing the whole business behind my mom&#39;s back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She didn&#39;t even know what was going on. And then I told my mom, &quot;Man, Ma, I need to talk to you. I know you say nope, I already got myself in this. And then you know what, I told him we&#39;re going to pay for it. And I already signed the contract.&quot; Which I was just lying to her. My mom went into it like, &quot;Yeah, we&#39;re going to buy it.&quot; And we gave him the money. Now we got the business is going really well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first year was going pretty crappy because the old owners left them messed up because my friends that was locked up and the business went down. They couldn&#39;t really handle it. But once we got in it, and I actually managed the restaurant by myself, because my mom was still at her other job, being in high school and managing the job, it was like, oh. But then, once we started doing it everything went well. The reviews went up, like fours and fives, fours and fives. This is authentic Mexican food, because we open at 6:00 in the morning, close at 9:00. During 6:00 it&#39;s all straight </span><span>up</span><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;Mexican food. Straight up. A lot of people, we got people from Ashley&#39;s Furniture, Bob&#39;s Furniture going.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean there&#39;s a line of trucks lined up to get in. A line of trucks. And they really liked them, and it&#39;s fresh made. My mom wakes up at 4:00 in the morning to make everything fresh, 6:00 in the morning, everything ready. And as you go eating, my mom actually making you homemade hand tortillas. You know? And that&#39;s what they love about that. And other restaurants just microwave, microwave. My mom, no. Everything fresh, fresh. Then, after 10:00 is best again, breakfast. Well, 7:00 &nbsp;the other wave comes for breakfast for American people, now French toast and stuff like that.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt8" id="cmnt_ref8">[h]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then that&#39;s that open to 10:00, and then the other wave comes from chimichangas, burritos, quesadillas that are Mexican American food. And it&rsquo;d be really great. I was cooking, I was doing deliveries. I was doing, what&#39;s it called, what is it&hellip; managing the money and everything. I was doing all of that, but with everything I came here. And now I&#39;m here, and I know I&#39;m going to go back. I know I&#39;m going to go back. And that&#39;s it. Before I go back, I&#39;m not going to waste my time here. I&#39;m actually trying to go to </span><span class="c0">VM [Ube Eme 00:30:55]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt9" id="cmnt_ref9">[i]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;and go to college.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you did graduate from that high school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you&#39;ve just been working with your parents at their restaurant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any other job?

Come on.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, I&#39;ll tell you.

One time, he told my sister, you know? He used to work for us, &quot;Every time you leave from here, I want you to give me a kiss on the cheek.&quot; So my sister told me, &ldquo;don&#39;t get mad because you will go crazy.&quot; I was like, &quot;All right.&quot; And then, I told my mom, &quot;Man, if I hear this dude talk to my sister like that again, you know what&#39;s up. I don&#39;t got to tell you right?&quot; And then my mom was like, &quot;You know what? You crazy. There&#39;s something wrong with your head.&quot; But the whole time, that was my mom&#39;s affair. She was having an affair with that dude. And one day, I was going back to&hellip; I forgot my cell phone at the house, so I went back, and I saw my mom in his room, and I didn&#39;t say, I be like, &quot;Yo mom, I came back for my cell phone, and I&#39;m out.&quot; and then she wasn&#39;t in her room.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wasn&#39;t in the restaurant either. So then I hear something, then she came out, and I was like, &quot;Oh hell no, what did you all do? Get out bro. I was like, get out man. I&#39;m not playing with you man. Get out.&quot; He did a little smirk. So when I grabbed him man, he was taller than me. He was like around six feet, and I&#39;m only 5.2. I lift him up. I lift him up. I lift him up, I broke the TV with his head. I lift him up again, threw him into his closet, started hitting him. I was like, &quot;When I come back, I&#39;ll give you two minutes. I need you the fuck out of here.&quot; And then he locked the door. He didn&#39;t want to come out when I came back. Then I came out with a knife. I was like, &quot;Ah, you don&#39;t want to leave man?&quot; He locked the door, double locked, and I kicked the door down. And I was like &quot;What&#39;s up man?&quot; But I didn&#39;t mean to stab him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s the time we was just trying to scare him. Then my mom came to me, and she started grabbing me. I was like, &ldquo;yo. Go.&rdquo; But I didn&#39;t know I was just ashamed. I actually pushed my mom and dropped her. But then I told him, &quot;Yo, my dad fed you. My dad did this for you, and all this man. You&#39;re going to treat him like that man. You&#39;re a phony ass dude man. </span><span class="c0">&ldquo;[Spanish 00:33:34]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt10" id="cmnt_ref10">[j]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;My nigga.&quot; You know? You don&#39;t do that shit to people that feed you man.&quot; I was like, &quot;Man, you&#39;re a piece of shit bro. If you don&#39;t leave right now, I&#39;m going to fuck you up man.&quot; And he just did this smirk once more. And he tried... Everything started because he reached into a box. He reached into a box and I thought he was going to get something.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, before he did that, the beginning, before he did that, what I did, I went and just grabbed him, I just threw him into the TV, grabbed onto his shirt, and I threw the box. I just slapped the shit out of the box, and it landed underneath the bed, because I thought he was going to get something with that smirk. I didn&#39;t let him do that. And then when I went back I thought he had something too, so I was like, I&#39;m not going to wait for that shit to go down. When I kicked the door down, I actually hooked him again, and he did the smirk again, but this time he was with something, or it was probably my imagination playing games on me because I was so mad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my mom grabbed me before. When she got up, she grabbed me again, and I was about to fall down, so I grabbed the knife like this, and boom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. Yeah. And then it just felt like, oh his meat just got cut off. I didn&#39;t know where. And then I told him man. &quot;I told you to leave man. I wasn&#39;t playing with you.&quot; But I wouldn&#39;t have stabbed him if my mom wasn&#39;t pulling me back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, I was trying to give myself a grip, because I know, if I would have fell down, he would have got on top of me. I know that for a fact. And now, everything happened, and then he was trying to lock the door again. I threw the door down again. This time I threw the door down completely. He went running to the other, the back door. He couldn&#39;t. He was limping and bleeding all over the place, and then my mom grabbed me.I &nbsp;gave her, I was like, &quot;Here. I&#39;m going to help him out. You&#39;re right. I&#39;m going to help him out.&quot; Because she was grabbing me. And he was holding on the door. I threw the door down, threw him down from the second floor. I was like, man, I told you to get the fuck out of here man, didn&#39;t I tell you that? Then I just started...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Still with the knife?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was already... Because he went like this, and I took it back out. When I was falling down, I took it back out. But I thought I hit him somewhere here. I was like, damn, I&#39;m fucked. But it was actually around here, his leg because he was tall.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On his leg?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because I was like this, falling down, so he actually hit his leg, but I thought I hit him here. So, I still threw him down the second floor. I told him to leave, he wasn&#39;t leaving. We was outside, he was like, &quot;Nah man, help me out man.&quot; I was like, &quot;Man, fuck you man. You deserve to die, bitch.&quot; Like, &quot;The fuck you mean I&#39;m going to help you out man? You disrespected my father and me man, plus I been wanting to fuck you up for saying that shit to my sister.&quot; So then I just started beating him up outside, beating him up. He didn&#39;t still want to leave. He didn&#39;t want to leave. So then, we took it in front of the restaurant. After that point, like from the back to the front. Some lady came through, she was like, No. She thought I was robbing him. She tried getting me. I just kept fucking him up. Then they called the cops.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the restaurant is close to your house?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The restaurant is on the bottom; the house is on the top.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, okay, okay, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you took him down to the restaurant.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not inside, but outside the back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not inside but outside.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They called the cops.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they called the cops, the lady, and I was like, &quot;Hell no.&quot; I snucked him again, dropped him to the floor. I dropped him to the floor a lot of times honestly. I was like, big time man. I&#39;m a short guy, but I was so mad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the anger took over you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So then I was like, damn, the cops. And I was soaked with blood. I called my uncle. I got in the car like that. &quot;Uncle have some clothes ready for me, something went down.&quot; My uncle, when I call him, it&#39;s because something went down for real. So I took the back alleys to get to the crib, then I took Route 1. That&#39;s the highway, and then I took through the riversides, everything so they couldn&#39;t find me. I went to my friends, dropped the car, and that day I got paid $3,000 from my job because it was winter. So I used that money, and I still paid all my friends. I was only left with a thousand and something.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I used that money to come here. It too two days of the cops saying that I was going to do like five years. I was paranoid. I was like, man. The second day, I hadn&#39;t talked to my dad. I talked to my sisters. I was like, you know what, I&#39;m going to go to Mexico. I&#39;m not doing time, man. I&#39;m not doing time. And then, I came, and then the cop... When I was in _______. I came, I did not even know how to get here. I ended up being in _______in Mexico, the border. In Texas, that was the most racist place I could go to. In Texas, they was really checking people down like back to forth. And a lady from New York actually came with me, helping me out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was helping her out type of thing. She was like, &quot;Something is going on with you.&quot; She was like, &quot;Don&#39;t tell me, I&#39;m going to just help you out.&quot; I guess she could sense it. And then she helped me out through here. She actually offered me to drop me off to my house in ______, MX, to my other parents&rsquo; house. I came down. I let them know, you know what, I&#39;m okay. At the border, they separated us at the bus for the Greyhound. They separated us, and they stole from me 3,000 Pesos, the people that switch your dollars. They stole from me that much. And then, I was actually so heated up I wanted to fight with everybody. So, I was trying to fight them.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The lady was like, nah, nah, nah. You don&#39;t do that over here. As soon as she said that the whole narcos come in the bus station. The narcos come in. She was like, &quot;Now who over here trying to cross the border with the, what&rsquo;s it called the[Can&rsquo;t tell what this word is 00:39:26]?&quot; I was like, &quot;Man, </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 00:39:27]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt11" id="cmnt_ref11">[k]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Man. Don&#39;t do that shit. The lady grabbed me again. She was like, &quot;yo, </span><span class="c0 c12">c</span><span class="c12">&aacute;</span><span class="c0 c12">llate </span><span class="c3 c0">man.&quot; And then they grabbed another crew and they took everything away from them, but good thing they had their tickets. They put me on the same bus as them, and the other lady-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The narcos?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was that nigga, the guys that they stole everything from. So we was in the bus with them, they were like, &quot;Yeah, they robbed us man. It&#39;s because we&#39;re trying to cross the border, but fuck it you know. We just got to go back to it at the back.&quot; So they came back, and they separated me from the lady. They made me go on the first bus, and they told the lady she had to wait until the next day for the next bus, so I left. I came back to Mexico City, and I didn&#39;t know my house was this close, so I ended up going to Guajuato to my other parents&rsquo; house, then from [Spanish] I went to my other parents&rsquo; house to Guerrerro with my grandparents. And I ended up going, I don&#39;t even know how I got to my grandpa&#39;s house. Nobody picked me up, nothing. I just went by myself asking. And then as soon as I got to the town they be like,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&quot;[Spanish 00:40:36]&quot;.</span><sup><a href="#cmnt12" id="cmnt_ref12">[l]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They remember me because I used to kill animals when I was little.

They also was like, man, &ldquo;mi hijo, Como estas&hellip;&rdquo; You know, that love stuff, and it was great. I actually just stayed with them like two and two until I decided to move back to the city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how was it coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t like it. When I first came, it was like I was an outcast. It was a big change for me. You come here, they be like no. You go to some places; you can&#39;t even speak English. They be like, &quot;No because you in Mexico, speak Spanish.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the opposite of what they do over there?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I be like, &quot;No man, I speak whatever I want to speak.&quot; You know? If you go to the countryside, my workers out here, they be like, &quot;No. You got to dress up like us.&quot; They don&#39;t like people from the city, especially you from over there, they don&#39;t like that. And the thing they don&#39;t like is that they think you always talking behind their back, that you make them feel less. That&#39;s what they don&#39;t like, and that&#39;s not really the thing, and besides, it&#39;s like the life experience that you have, and the life they live is way too different. It&#39;s like you come from working in a factory to growing crops. It&#39;s like two different worlds.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what they don&#39;t really like. And it&#39;s like, let&#39;s just say that it&#39;s not that their education is bad, it&#39;s just that they limit it to their education. They&#39;re closed minded. They&#39;re not open minded on how to help people, how to help the world out. They just focus in one thing. It&#39;s like I was saying early on, live life by the moment, not by time. That&#39;s what they focus on. It&#39;s like I&#39;m going to work today, so I&#39;m able to eat at least beans today. And over there it&#39;s like, I&#39;m going to work today man, I&#39;m going to get me a double cheeseburger, stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, it hasn&#39;t been that good. And besides that, looking for a job, and not knowing the process on how to look for a job, and they tell you about this word, and this word in Spanish, it&#39;s like, &quot;Yo, I don&#39;t know what that is.&quot; And they be like, over there, they&rsquo;re nicer actually in the United States with that, or be like, figure it out, </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 00:44:18].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt15" id="cmnt_ref15">[o]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;They don&#39;t really help you out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. So your parents have more than one house in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you spent, if I&#39;m understanding correctly, you spent six months with your grandparents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and two.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two and two?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and then here, six months. It&#39;s been probably six and six, yeah. Around there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, okay. And so what made you decide to come back to the city?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They was trying to make me work in the farming area, and I was like no, I can&#39;t do that.

My dad wanted me to stay there over there too so I could get the houses more up to date, maintenance and all that. He wanted me to live off of that. I&#39;m like, I can&#39;t do that man. I was, &quot;You know what, I&#39;m going to go to the city man.&quot; I can&#39;t be asking you all for money, man. And my parents are those type of people like, you know what, &quot;Here, here, here, here.&quot; I&#39;m not really like that. So, I decided to come. I ended up working at Liverpool in the kitchen, and I was like, &quot;Yeah, I know how to cook.&quot; And they gave me the job. But then they were using me because of my English. Before me um</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[Spanish 00:45:48]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt18" id="cmnt_ref18">[r]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;used to come, they used to be, &quot;Yo, come help us out.

I&#39;m only getting paid.&quot; And the crazy, I do it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They value that job big time because that job you was really just making like a 150 a month. A month. Like 4,000 Pesos. I really valued that job. That job made me like actually learn how to... I never starve. Being in Mexico is like, I have gone sometimes that I have to starve until I got this job. This job is a blessing to me right now. But over there, and people used to tell me, no it&#39;s because you&#39;re wasting too much money. It&#39;s like, how you guys live? You guys are feeding 10 mouths. I&#39;m only feeding myself, it&#39;s not enough for me.

That, I want to do something with human resources and guidance. Something like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One of my professors is political science, and then not her, but two of the other students are political science too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;ve taken a lot of political science courses but I&#39;m studying, history.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh history, man. I love history man. I love history. Back in my school man, I was like this with my history teachers actually. My history teacher, Mr.Shatlenburgh and Mr.Snyder. He actually for my birthday, I walked in class. He got me a lot of cupcakes. I&#39;m like, man, why you do that man. You&#39;re about to make me cry man. And he said, you&#39;re a good kid. You might not get all As, but I do see your interest in that. In the area you know. I like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;ll definitely introduce you to her if she&#39;s not doing an interview.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp; [Chuckles]Great. But I really want to do something like that. But the other, I want to get more into is more of the United States than here. But for what I&#39;m seeing, I do want to get involved in something here to change around because there is a way to fix the situation. There&#39;s a lot of ways. The thing is that they know, once they fix the situation in Mexico, they&#39;re going to lose money. How? The city might make more money, but the own people, they&#39;re going to lose money. Corruption, like the cops, I&#39;m telling you. If you give them a certain money, there is three ways. You give them the money that they ask you for and they let you go, you go down to quarters, or they beat you up until you have that, and throw you outside the city.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s ways to avoid that. There&#39;s cameras, all this new technology. But they don&rsquo;t really want to get involved in that, because they know they&#39;re going to lose money. They know they&#39;re going to lose money, but, I would like to gain something like that. That&#39;s why I actually wanted to go back to college, do something like that, get these areas more familiarized with the technology like water supplies. Like, Mexico is really beautiful, but they throw so much garbage in the rivers that this is just messing it up. It&#39;s messing it up. I would like to work with something like that. In those areas that combines law and the environment. Something like that, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to go back to one point just because I have it clarified. So by the time that this whole situation with the man happened&hellip;DACA. What was going on with that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c0">DACA, well that... I was actually thinking of coming to Mexico because Donald Trump wanted to cancel DACA. So, I tried to do my papers, they told me, &quot; I don&#39;t think you will be getting approved this time.&quot; So I was like, &quot;Man, so I&#39;m going back where I started.&quot; So I was already stressing out. I was stressing out like, how am I going to do it now? My life is going so good for me right now. I got my job. I got everything going for me. So, DACA was like, I should have married when I had the chance. I should have married. I would have had my papers right now. So that really took me off guard. Then when I came back here they were saying, &quot;Oh, no, after all we are going to give you DACA again.&quot; You know? And it&#39;s like you shouldn&#39;t really play with that cause not just because we are... I consider myself American. It&#39;s not because we wasn&#39;t born there, but...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s one of my questions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not just because we&#39;re from there. They&hellip; It&#39;s just we could have a nervous breakdown with that because they&#39;re playing with our feelings. They should come up with something, okay, we&#39;re not going to give you the papers, but at the end of the day, think about it, DACA is really useful, but then again, why do they just want you to stay there? They might as well just give you the papers if they give you the DACA to come back and forth. And the government will make more money that way too, because, you know, taxes, they&#39;re going to get more taxes from everything we&#39;re purchasing, more travelers will come to visit, and all around the world really. You know? But no, they just want us to stay there? It&#39;s like they&#39;re just giving us fake hope. They&#39;re giving us something to fish at just for the political at that moment. Other than that, they don&#39;t want us there. It&#39;s just a catch for their political to get that presidency at that moment. That&#39;s all it really is. But they really shouldn&#39;t do that. There&#39;s better ways to do that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really shouldn&#39;t do that. I know I agree I messed up in what I did. Even myself, I agree. They shouldn&#39;t give me DACA. They shouldn&#39;t. I know I messed up. They shouldn&#39;t give me DACA you know, because for every act there is a consequence in that even though I wouldn&#39;t like that, but that&#39;s reality. You know? Now, I mean if I was to apply and they don&#39;t give me DACA, I would understand because I did that. I messed up. I messed up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that was on me. But DACA is really great. More than anything it actually brings a lot of people out of the streets. If you gangsters and all that, it&#39;s like man, I could get this? My life could really change if I put effort to it. So you set your mind to different state of mind. Like, you know what, if he could get that why can&#39;t I? Why can&#39;t I get that? DACA opens opportunities for you. It doesn&#39;t just close you. I never thought I would be able to get a job in security just sitting down like </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 00:53:11].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt20" id="cmnt_ref20">[t]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">&nbsp;But when I got it, I was like, man, I&#39;m like, I feel good.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It makes me feel good. I feel power at this society now. They&#39;re always going to discriminate, but I feel more American than most of them. You know? But&ndash;&ndash;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has it been like to be separated from your family?</span><sup><a href="#cmnt21" id="cmnt_ref21">[u]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try not to think of it because there&#39;s sometimes that I get depressed. I don&#39;t even know why I&#39;m mad. I&#39;m just mad like, man, I haven&#39;t seen my dad, my mom, my sisters, my baby sister. Well, she&#39;s sixteen, but that&#39;s still my baby sister. Man, I used to see them every day. It used to be me wanting to move out of the house and be away from them, so now, man, I wish I could hug them. You know? I wish I could hug them. But I try not to think about that because I&#39;m that person that really gets down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0 c3">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what happened to your parents after the whole thing with them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they&#39;re not together anymore. They&#39;re not together. That was the best thing that could happen to them. Right now, they&#39;re more happy. My moms with the guy right now. And I be going off on him still. I be going off on him.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you still talk to them?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I talk to them, but the thing is that we don&#39;t really talk like that because my parents grew up like, sometimes you got to grow, take care of your own business. So we really don&#39;t talk. If anything goes down, you&#39;ve got to handle it yourself unless it&#39;s really something deep, deep, deep, then they&#39;ll help me out, but other than that it&#39;s like either you just take the money... Money talks really. Money talks, so just take care of that. That&#39;s it. Take care of yourself. If you get in trouble just try to fix it out. That&#39;s it. But no, we really don&#39;t talk like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We really don&#39;t talk like that. Everybody is on their own wave. Like ever since I came here everybody like separated, my sisters, my parents. I was the one that was always bugging them, because I&#39;m annoying as hell with them. I be, &quot;No, what do you mean we&#39;re not going to go out today. What are you trying to say about that?&quot; Man, &ldquo;Like get in the car man.&rdquo; We&#39;re just going out and that&#39;s it. I was like that with my parents and my sisters. Like, &quot;What do you guys want?&quot; I just was, &quot;You know what, we need some family time.&quot; For me, family time was way too important. Way too important. I used to get so mad they didn&#39;t actually give me that attention with all of us together. But yeah. I really do miss them, but I try not to think about it. I just think about the moment, like right now. I&#39;ve got to work, try to sell something, that&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The hardest part? Socializing, I guess. Socializing. Actually, the hardest part is being with your family in Mexico that you&#39;re not used to being with, like grandparents, aunts, uncles, and taking back your home, then that was their home. That&#39;s the hardest part.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a little bit more about that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, since my parents got a couple of places here, at the end of the day, it&#39;s not their places no more because they haven&#39;t lived there all their life. Their families, they feel like they&#39;re the ones that own it. So it&#39;s like back and forth. Now, I already received my inheritance from my grandma, half an acre, and now, they was trying to take it away from me. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah, man. I can&#39;t do that.&quot; That&#39;s the hardest part because over here the family is like, well you could be good and all, but once you mess with the land, it&#39;s like, no, we&#39;re not that good no more.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s stay away. That&#39;s the hardest part, but I&#39;m like the type of guy that don&#39;t really take that part seriously. But yeah, we&#39;re just fighting for them, and don&#39;t take it as serious man. It&#39;s just land. I&#39;m still mine, I don&#39;t know why you&#39;re trying to fight for it. But we&#39;re okay man, don&#39;t worry about it. We could solve this by just speaking through it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And, have you been discriminated against for being a returning migrant here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Like a couple of times we&#39;d go to the bars, they&#39;d be like, &quot;Don&#39;t talk English. Don&#39;t do that man.&quot; They&#39;d be saying some weird Spanish words that I really don&#39;t get.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, </span><span class="c0">pocho [Spanish 00:57:54].</span><sup><a href="#cmnt22" id="cmnt_ref22">[v]</a></sup><span class="c0">&nbsp;I really don&#39;t get their words. I&#39;m not really used to speaking Spanish fluently, so I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay</span><span class="c0">, [Spanish 00:58:03]</span><sup><a href="#cmnt23" id="cmnt_ref23">[w]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">.&quot; You know? But yeah, they do be discriminating too much here. If you&#39;re from out there it&#39;s like you&#39;re a traitor to them. That&#39;s why they have you as if you was a traitor. But unfortunately, it&#39;s like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you think that the United States, and living in the United States has made you who you are today?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It has made me appreciate things that I should appreciate before, like my family, the job that I had. I didn&#39;t really struggle. I was making myself struggle, but now that I think about it. I didn&#39;t ever struggle.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never struggled. And besides that, man, I miss the food man. I miss the food. I mean Mexican food is really awesome, but I&#39;m used to that food over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What food do you miss?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The mashed potatoes, the mac and cheese, the fried chicken, stuff like that, the burgers. You know, the corn bread, the ham. I miss all of that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the US, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a fact right now, I would have probably been in the same job making more money, and with more knowledge of my job. Right now, if I was there, and I would actually have some of my family members go over there with the visa that my job offers. But yeah, it was the visa for six months for landscaping. I would be able to hook people up with that. And it would have been better. I guess me and my dad would have probably finished paying off the house, because I wasn&#39;t making bad money. I wasn&rsquo;t making bad money. Well, we were halfway through paying the house off. The house probably, we would have been living only me and my sisters. My uncles probably would have... I think that would have happened. Or probably opened another business. I&#39;m really good with that, with business stuff.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m actually trying to do something like that over here too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But I&#39;ve still got to go back. It&#39;s like, I don&#39;t think I will ever get used to Mexico ever, and I&#39;m not trying to get used to it because for me it&#39;s like, once you get used to something, it&rsquo;s hard to un-break that. I&#39;m not trying to get used to it.</span></p><p class="c11 c17"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why not?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why? It&#39;s like you&#39;re getting used to just living at a certain amount in life. I want to surpass that even if I got to do time. When I go back, I want to go back, but I want to have my title. I want to have my business, so this way it doesn&#39;t hit me. At least I did something. It wasn&#39;t a waste of time.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so kind of along those lines, now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what do you think you&#39;d like to do, or what are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams are to open another business, this time without my parents.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What business would you open?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The same business that my momma has right now. The same thing and make it better of course.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That, and just get myself into a more community services, guiding people as to why they shouldn&#39;t let their temper overcome them, because by one action could mess your life up big time, big time. I really don&#39;t recommend anybody to lose their temper in a situation like that, which you shouldn&#39;t really care for even though it&#39;s your family, but, that little act could mess you up all your life. All your life. And you just got to think about the future at that moment. It&#39;s not you, it&#39;s them. Let them deal with that situation, that&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the next few questions, which are the last ones are more reflective. So, what can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What they can do? I think they should be able to guide them on how to get a job, how the process of getting a job in Mexico is. On top of that, It&rsquo;s not&hellip; I don&#39;t think it&#39;s only about how we&#39;re able to reintegrate like that, but how could we better this country up? Because we come from other. We got way more ideas. Like I said we&#39;re more open minded to certain things like Marijuana, making Marijuana legal. That would reduce narcs, money&hellip; stuff like that. You know? We need some stuff like that. Show you how to get a house. How to get a house, how to get the job. What are the laws. That&#39;s what they should really actually do, explain the laws to us more than anything so we&#39;re able to protect ourselves with that, because corruption here is messed up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They should actually really focus on the law, give us the feedback about the law and our rights. That&#39;s what they should really do because, then, like I told you, corruption is crazy. They make you look like </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 01:03:46]. Like [Spanish 01:03:49]. </span><sup><a href="#cmnt24" id="cmnt_ref24">[x]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">They should definitely help us out with that, and the job. Those two, that would be perfect because with a job you are able to get a house. It&#39;s like if you know English and everything with opportunities out here are really great actually. With a job, if you know English, and you got experience in communications, opportunities are here are endless. Endless.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can the US government do to help Mexican deportees and their families that they leave behind? I know it&#39;s a big question.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well honestly, I think they can&#39;t really do anything. They can&#39;t do anything. The only thing they would be able to do is just take the border down, but that&#39;s not going to happen. That&#39;s the only thing they could do. Why? Because they can&#39;t do anything. They just can&#39;t do anything. Families are not going to be together. That&#39;s not going to work. Unless they take the border down, that&#39;s not going to be possible. On top of that, the US can&#39;t really get involved with the Latins. They&#39;re always going to have their people&#39;s back at the end of the day you know. And for them to help us out, its like how they could help us. The only thing they could do is just pay our transportation to take us where we need to go. That&#39;s about the only thing they could do. But for separating families, they can&#39;t do anything about that, maybe grant you a visa to go at least a week. But that&#39;s still not worth it, not a lot.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do young Mexican men in the United States turn to crime and gangs?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Depends on the hood they live in. If they live in a certain hood, and they affiliated with certain crews, that&#39;s when they get more... And the thing is that more people get involved in that after like they turn 17. Once they actually think they&#39;re grown. And those are the people, I notice the people that get most into that at least in Jersey are the people that used to get bullied a lot. The ones that think they are big already, they actually want to get it. They couldn&#39;t do that when they was younger so now they do it when they&#39;re grown. I think it&#39;s just a lot of them trying to fit in, with all this rap music, this ghetto stuff. They&#39;re just trying to fit the artists and the music.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, like Fetty Wap and all this. They&#39;re just trying to fit. Then that&#39;s what they&#39;re really trying to fit. They&#39;re just trying to fit. If they was really about it, they would have actually done it since they were younger. You know? Because that&#39;s how they grew up. But most of the people I noticed that after they turned 17, they grown, they be like, man, I&#39;m all... Yeah, that&#39;s not how it works.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Either you&#39;re really struggling, or your area is not that good that you got to get down for that, or there&#39;s just something really wrong that nobody else knows. But a lot of people just do it to fit in. That&#39;s it. That&#39;s why they never get nowhere. And those are the people that get more locked up. They get locked up, why, because they do more stupid shit. They just do stupid shit, and the people that are real, they really don&#39;t get caught. I never got caught with any of that. Never got caught. I always just keep my mouth quiet under the table, under the table, under the table. But I think it&#39;s somebody just fitting in. Everybody wants to fit in. Everybody wants to get the prettiest girl, the prettiest car. It&#39;s just a matter of fitting in. Now that I think about it, I think I was trying to fit in too.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What exactly were you trying to fit into?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Into the money style. That luxurious stuff, which everything Gucci belts, Timberlands, Jordans, that&#39;s not really good. But once I got into a little older, I was like, you know what, that is not shit. I need a car. I need a house. Stuff like that. I need a business. I got started getting into stuff like that because it&#39;s just something for me, something that I could call my own. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what can Mexican government do to prevent returning migrants from returning to crime and gangs when they come back?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More education. They should enforce more programs for mentorship. They should force that big time, more mentorships to people. And not do it when they are ready. Let&#39;s say they only do things when you&#39;re already back here now. No, already don&#39;t do it. Why would you do that? It&#39;s just really a waste of time. An old dog can learn new tricks. Do it when you first start. Maybe they should be like, &quot;You know what? Let&#39;s see which kids having trouble in their family. Let&#39;s take them off of that.&quot; Maybe they&#39;re not misbehaving, but before they misbehave, let&#39;s try to take down let&#39;s mentor this kid. They should start in more on the body language and see what&#39;s going on. And that, because most people be like, mentorships, really, what I don&#39;t really like, they do make people feel out of place because they only have certain people, and the other people is like, you know, you&rsquo;re not worth it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what they should stop doing. They should focus more for mentorship. And they could do that big time. Look, college students, high school kids, in order for them to graduate they should give them a list a day or a week to go to middle schools or elementary schools. You know what, let&#39;s mentor these kids, and other programs like that, they should do it. And it would be fun both for the high school kids and college students. Do you know what? They could look up to me, but they don&#39;t think of stuff like that, see? They don&#39;t think about stuff like that. But that, it&#39;s like there&#39;s always going to be a person that are always going to change your mind.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now, you&#39;re doing it, don&#39;t think you&#39;re doing it for you. Think about the person&#39;s life that you could change. That&#39;s how you have got to think about it. That&#39;s what my teacher Mrs. Davis told me. That&#39;s because I actually changed because of her too. You want to help people, don&#39;t just do it because you want to help them. Think of the life that you could actually change because you&#39;re going to send the same issues to them, and they&#39;re going to send the same issues to the other person. So yeah. They should do something to add more mentorship to kids all over the place man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And my last question is, why do you think that people in Mexico have a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they think that we&#39;re all that, that we&#39;re superior to them. And honestly, in a lot of cases, there is, because most people that get deported here didn&#39;t know how to be humans. They don&#39;t know how to be human beings. They think that you&#39;re better to them, like let&#39;s say, you&#39;re in the city, like I said, you&#39;re in the country, you&#39;re going to look at them lesser than you are. And a lot of people do got that mentality. I do understand why their situation, why they think that we do come here and bum. Plus, they be here in the country, and we come, and just because we know English, we get a good job, boom. The other thing that the government should do, they should use us to guide people in learning English. That would be something so great for the country.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s millions of us that speak good English. Maybe we might not be the best vocab or writers or anything but, </span><span class="c0">[Spanish 01:11:41], </span><sup><a href="#cmnt25" id="cmnt_ref25">[y]</a></sup><span class="c3 c0">a ghetto English. No? But I still help them out, because during the process is where education, they start learning how to educate their selves, and change their mind. The government should definitely do that out here in Mexico. And I think both countries will work better. The economy will work better for both countries, something like that. But yeah, that&#39;s a reason why I think they don&#39;t like us, because, yes, most of the time we come here, and we just take the jobs that they actually been waiting for. That&#39;s the reason why.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So those were all the questions that I had. Now I give you the... This is just a time for you to say anything else you want to add, whether it be like something that you didn&#39;t tell me, or that you think that people should know, or clarifying, whatever you want to say.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think people should take DACA more seriously. DACA is a real life changing, especially, imagine of the things that you wasn&#39;t doing before you got DACA. And just like you having DACA, it do open so many opportunities. Work with it. Don&#39;t let the government bring you down when they are saying, &quot;No, we&#39;re going to close DACA down.&rdquo; Don&#39;t let that bring you down. We&#39;re too many of us for all of us to come back down.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;DACA will help you get a better job. Use it to get better education. Education is definitely the way to go around it. Instead of doing, or going and disputing about it, just dispute about it but with our knowledge. Give feedback as to why we should definitely get and deserve it, not just because we&#39;ve been there for a long time we deserve it. Let&#39;s fight for it also, no? Because DACA, like I mentioned, this is an opportunity. You already feel an American with that -- imagine it going to do what people haven&#39;t even done, and they&#39;re from over there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Imagine the things that you could accomplish, and if you have already accomplished things without papers, great. But if you got DACA. You&hellip;Imagine what you could definitely do with that, man. Don&#39;t let it bring you down. And just don&#39;t pay attention to the news with those things. There&#39;s always somebody that&#39;s going to fight for us, always somebody that&#39;s going to look for us. And that&#39;s it. We&#39;re Americans too at the end of the day honestly. That&#39;s about it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anything else?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I&#39;m saying, just thank you guys for taking the interview, taking time for this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you for talking to me, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I hope it was able to help you guys in some way or another.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope it helped you too, to get it out at least.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c3 c0">Kain:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.
