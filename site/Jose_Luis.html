This is Lizzy, and I&#39;m here with Jose Luis for his interview. Like we said before, this interview is going to be a little bit more open-ended. I don&#39;t have any specific questions that I need to touch on. There&#39;s a few areas I&#39;m going to try maybe guide the conversation, but it&#39;s really your chance to share your story and hear what you have to say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, maybe a good place to start would be how old were you when you left Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when I left Mexico, I was six years old. I finished first grade and basically my dad came over to pick us up to go and get to know California. So when we left here, my dad had everything already set up, basically, like you said.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He had already been living there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. He left back in &#39;88.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he went back for us. I think it was in &rsquo;92? &#39;91, &#39;92. From there, we just got our visa so we can go over there legally.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of visa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a tourist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A tourist visa, okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We weren&#39;t planning to stay. We were just going to go in, get to know California. And then from there, my dad decided just have us stay. From there we just stayed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Were there any specific reasons that your family wanted to leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not precisely. It was just basically my dad. He was making money at that point. He said we were going to be better. From there, we just stayed basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. This was in Orange County?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Orange County. We were in San Clemente.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;San Clemente, okay. I know Orange County a bit. It&#39;s a big county but a lot of really beautiful places. So, do you remember ... I know you were pretty young, but do you have any memories of your first day in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. That was the first day. I cannot forget it when they took me to Albertsons.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s the grocery store, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The grocery store. Yeah, they took me to the grocery store. I was like, &quot;Wow,&quot; because I have never seen a store that big and clean. I was six years old. I was, like, amazed. From there, that was the memory that I won&#39;t forget. It was my first time. I wanted to get everything, basically. It seems like it was just yesterday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m 37.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. You still remember that clearly, 30 years later?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can see how that would be a powerful memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically it was a drastic change, but for good, basically. It was something impacting your life basically right there like I see it because you see something that amazes you. It&#39;s something that&hellip; it&#39;s right there in your mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you start school right away?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably, it took not too long. I don&#39;t know. I can&#39;t remember how long, but I started right away. I started second grade. Then from there, my life started. At the beginning, it was hard because I was quiet. I didn&#39;t even understand anything. But the good thing, I had some bilingual teachers and they were really helpful. They were really helpful. I had so many wonderful experiences in school. I even participated in the </span><span class="c7 c8">baile folklorico</span><span class="c0">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was a dance, Mexican dance. Like, they would dance the </span><span class="c7 c8">jarabe tapat&iacute;o</span><span class="c0">, have you heard it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c7">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like a </span><span class="c7 c8">ranchero</span><span class="c0">, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. You did this in elementary school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, elementary school. That was nice. It&#39;s good experience. My life started right there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are there any particular teachers that you remember as being extra helpful?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ms. Johnson, Ms. Chambers, my math teacher, that she was really strict. I love math. And Ms. Johnson, she was my history teacher for sixth grade. Ms. Chambers, it was for fourth grade. They were really, really nice and very helpful. Very helpful. And that&rsquo;s why&hellip; when you have a good memory like that, it&#39;s hard for you to forget those things, especially people that they help you. There&#39;s a lot of memories. A lot of memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then when I graduate sixth grade, then I went to middle school, high school. High school it was the best but at the same time it was my worst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Why is that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a&mdash;honor student. I became an honor student, had some good grades. Like they say, once you hit high school, it&#39;s a whole different thing. It&rsquo;s a whole different thing. You have to be strong-minded and know what you want. I started hanging out with wrong friends, and that&#39;s where everything changed it. My mom, she was always on top of me. My freshman year was wonderful, and then sophomore. My other two years, my mom just let go of the strings, and I start walking the wrong side of the street basically, you would say. Hang out with the bad influence. That&#39;s where everything started.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They told me, &quot;Hey, bring your car or something.&quot; I told my dad, &quot;Hey, can I borrow the car?&quot; &quot;Just be careful.&quot; In less than six months, I wrecked two cars. Two cars, for what? For just taking my friends to another town that I didn&#39;t even knew what they were going to do, and to beat up some other guys. That&#39;s burning the car basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I tried to straighten my life back, it was already too late because I was already&hellip; Basically, I had a record already. No driver license, reckless driving, suspended license, when I never had one. That&#39;s how everything started. The saddest thing is for high school it was when I was working, because I started working, and knowing that it was your graduation day and you were at work. You&#39;re not going to graduate. Why? Because you didn&#39;t make the credits.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, I had my best friend that we were always together. He went over to my job and said, &quot;Today is our graduation day.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I know. And we&#39;re not graduating,&quot; because he didn&#39;t graduate either because he was missing credits too. He even started crying. I was about to cry, I was like, &quot;We&#39;re going to make it again. There&#39;s more opportunities.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you able to ever go back and finish it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was going to Horizons, I don&#39;t know if you heard about it? I thought we were going to Horizons to make up the credits, but at that point I met my first wife. I was already working. So we didn&#39;t got married but we were living together for three years. And then we just didn&#39;t work out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you don&#39;t mind, I want to go back to that memory about the graduation day because that sounds like a very powerful memory for you. Was that your hardest? You said that some of the worst times in your life was in high school, was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that was one of the biggest one, and because I started experiencing more about discrimination.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically the year was about to end, and you have to go turn in your books. That day, I wasn&#39;t feeling good to go to school but I went and just turned in my books. I was just walking to the library. Once I was walking, there&#39;s another guy said, &quot;Fucking Mexican. Why don&#39;t you just go back to Mexico?&quot; So at that point I just turned and basically, sorry about the word, but I just beat the shit out of him. So I didn&#39;t like that. I got afraid because I didn&#39;t went to school that day and beating up a student, basically it was going to be one of my worst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, this was another student that said that to you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it a classmate or someone that you already knew?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was basically, they were at lunch. I was just walking to the library and there was that comment. And basically, I just turned and beat him up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did that feel like inside when you heard him say that comment, someone that should be your peer?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sad and anger. Because basically at that point, I knew what it was but I didn&#39;t consider myself like that because I was raised over there since I was a little child. I never needed papers, documentation. I never had to. So I didn&#39;t knew about it. Basically, that comment just turn my anger basically and just went at him and just ran. I just ran and since there was a sheriff right there, because at high school there&#39;s a sheriff now, they were looking for me and they caught me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took me to the office and said like, &quot;Well, why didn&rsquo;t you came to school? Plus, you beat up a student.&quot; I just stood quiet. &quot;You&#39;re lucky if their parents doesn&#39;t press charges.&quot; Then when I told him, &quot;So if he press charges, can I press charges too?&quot; &quot;Why you?&quot; &quot;Racist. He told me, &#39;Fucking Mexican. Go back to Mexico.&#39;&quot; &quot;Is there a witness?&quot; &quot;Yes, there is.&quot; &quot;Why didn&#39;t you just came and report it? Why you had to beat him up?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one of my mistakes, but I didn&#39;t think about it. I just reacted and I apologized about it. I said like, &quot;Well.&quot; When the principal told the parents what he said, they changed their mind about pressing charges.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They decided not to press charges?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Said like, &quot;Well, you&#39;re going to be expelled.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay. That&#39;s fine.&quot; My mom, she started crying. I was like my head down basically. I was disappointing my parents. That was just my mom at that point. I was afraid even to go home because of my dad. Once we got home, my mom just told him, &quot;You see what he have done?&quot; to my dad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad here in Mexico, he was a professional boxer. So, every time that we had on the weekends, my best friend, some other ones go to the house and we practice with my dad. My dad told me, &quot;I didn&#39;t show you what you know to start picking up some fights, because you can hurt someone.&quot; By knowing boxing, it&#39;s basically a responsibility too, because with one single hit, you can really hurt someone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your dad was disappointed that you had used what you learned from him?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. That&#39;s why it was basically my worst in my high school. Probably, if I had a chance to repeat it, I would just tell my mom not to let go of the leash.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To let go of what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The leash.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to let go of the leash?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You wish that she-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to give me too much freedom like I had. From there, they received a call from the school saying that they were going to give me another chance to go back to school, but I decided not to. So, they&#39;re like, &quot;What are you going to do?&quot; &quot;I already have a job.&quot; So, I started working. I left my job and I went to a better one. I started working as a shift manager at Del Taco.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now I&#39;m wondering, your decision not to go back to school, was it related to the experience you had gone through, the fight?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Actually, yes. Emotionally, probably I got hurt because of that, but I told them it&#39;s something that I have to let go and continue my life. So basically at that point, every time that they call me names or something, I react. I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just something that I picked it up or I don&#39;t know. From there, I should say I have a short temper.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically, if I see someone arguing in the streets like the other day. I came over here and sign my ... What&#39;s it called? My resign, because I was going to be rehirable, and they told me, &quot;No, you ain&#39;t going to be rehirable.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is at?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ____.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At ____. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;All right.&quot; From the inside, I was mad. I took the Metro home. I was just doing my own business and everything. There&#39;s a guy wanting to get off at the Metro. Once he gets off, pow, right in the back of the head, smack me. &quot;You son of a bitch.&quot; I go like, &quot;I&#39;m not in the mood.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think he did that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Supposedly, he couldn&#39;t get off on time. But I&#39;m all like, &quot;What am I going to do?&quot; We were all smashed in and everything, so I couldn&#39;t move more. I&#39;m like, &quot;You son of ...&quot; I&#39;m sorry, but I broke his nose. I was like, &quot;Hey!&quot; Boom. I just had enough of it. People is just trying to take advantage, especially here. If you put your guard down, someone&#39;s going to take advantage.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel people are more likely to take advantage of you because you&#39;re a return migrant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not just because of that, they see it because they think themselves more superior probably. They can do whatever they want because they&#39;re in Mexico. No, it doesn&#39;t work like that. Sometimes, I see people like the cops pulling someone out, bribing them with some money. I&#39;m used to, &quot;Hey, give me my ticket, and I&#39;ll just...&quot; That&#39;s how I&#39;m used to it. In here, just with 50 pesos, do whatever you want and they&#39;ll let you go. That&#39;s why it&#39;s really corrupted here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I first got here, I wanted to apply for police department, I&rsquo;m all like, &quot;You&#39;re too old already.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Nice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Too old?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They wanted people from 30 and down. I&#39;m like, &quot;30 and down, okay.&quot; Without experience, not knowing how to defend themselves, that&#39;s why people, they take advantage of. Well, after high school... Let&#39;s go back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let&#39;s go back. I was just going to say, I want to hear more about your life in the US after high school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically after high school, start working at Taco Bell, working there for quite some bit. Like I said, my first marriage didn&#39;t work out. I was 18 when I-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You moved in with her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was 18. Then, at 23, 22, everybody each way. I just continue working. And then I met a nice girl. I even tell my supervisor, &quot;Hey, hire her, hire her.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Why? Why?&quot; &quot;You just hire her.&quot; Basically, I was one of the top performers at work. Every time they wanted me, I was there. I was really responsible with everything basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My job at these times were wonderful. &quot;So basically, whatever you want, I have your back. If you want to fire someone, just let me know. I&#39;ll back you up. You will have a good reason for him to be get fired.&quot; &quot;All right.&quot; So, I had the backup. When I told him, &quot;Hey, hire her. Hire her.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Why? She&#39;s ugly.&quot; &quot;You just hire her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little workplace romance?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She started like, &quot;Well, I don&rsquo;t have any openings!&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Hire her in the back! Washing dishes!&quot; &quot;Well, she doesn&#39;t know English.&quot; &quot;Well, just hire in the washing dishes.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; Well, short story, she hire her. So like, &quot;She&#39;s going to be in my shift.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Come on, dude.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That defeats the purpose.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the end, she put her in the middle shift, and I was working late at night. I was coming in at 6:00 and leaving at 3:00 in the morning. Basically, I even told her, &quot;Hey, you want to learn more? I&#39;ll help you.&quot; At that point, what I like it&#39;s when we&#39;re fooling around, we&#39;re fooling around. When it&#39;s work, it&#39;s work. That&#39;s one of the things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the employees, they knew how I work. When I told them, &quot;Hey, when it&#39;s time for fooling around, we can fool around, whatever you want. Do any comments, whatever. Do whatever you want. Even if you want to go sit down, sit down without taking a break or anything. But when I tell you, you do something, I expect for you to do it. At that point, and right.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I started bringing her in. Then one day, I put her in the line making food. So like, &quot;Don&#39;t tell him. Okay?&quot; &quot;Just with me, you&#39;re going to be in the line.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; One day, I had to cover a morning shift with my supervisor and she came in. So like, &quot;We need help on the line.&quot; I was like, &quot;Hey, bring her in. Put her in the line.&quot; &quot;She doesn&#39;t know.&quot; Like, &quot;Put her in the line.&quot; &quot;All right.&quot; He put her. He was like, &quot;When did she learn that?&quot; &quot;I told you. When I commitment to something, I do it. She knows already.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then I told her, &quot;You want to learn to take orders?&quot; Plus I was teaching some other people out too, not just her because I always like people to grow, not just stay in one single spot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like you got a lot of leadership experience at this job?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The assistant manager, she was the fastest one in our store. She was the fastest. We couldn&#39;t keep up with her. I was the only one, I was stepping on her toes. Me and her, if we were both on the line, it was Fourth of July near at the pier. Imagine. So it was packed. We have a drive-through line. We had a line in the lobby all the way to the door. Open the other line. Have them take the drive-through, and me and her will take the lobby.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So like, &quot;Where you want to be?&quot; She was better at the steamer. &quot;Okay.&quot; So we were just both of us, we managed to get the job done. From there, other managers, district managers get to know us because of our hard work. We were second in the district. We were the second best store.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there, after probably I should say a year, two, I start going out with her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You said you eventually got married?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not legally. Basically, if it doesn&#39;t work out, there&#39;s no paperwork or anything. If it doesn&#39;t work out, it doesn&#39;t work out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Married in your heart?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still with her now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m married by three laws already, my 14-year-old, my 11-year-old, and my six-year-old. So, it couldn&#39;t get better than that. I can&#39;t be more married than that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do they all live in Mexico City now too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. They&#39;re in the US.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that being separated from them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard, hard, really hard. When I got deported, that was first time, my wife, she was pregnant. She said like, &quot;There&#39;s no milk. I got the cravings.&quot; Well, she was already pregnant. I&#39;m like, &quot;This is the middle of the night, why at this time? All right.&quot; So basically, every car, depending on the car is attractive to the cops. I had an &#39;87 Mustang 5.0 GT, and I didn&#39;t have a license. My wife had a license, but she doesn&#39;t know how to drive a stick.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We went inside and everything. The cop just pulled in with me in the back, didn&#39;t turn on the lights. He waited for me to go into the store, come out. And once I told my wife, &quot;You drive. I&#39;ll tell you how to do it. Just for the clutch, I&#39;ll tell you when to put the clutch in, and I&#39;ll put the gears in.&quot; &quot;Okay.&quot; So like, &quot;Come here.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yes?&quot; &quot;Can I see your driver license and insurance?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Why? I&#39;m not driving?&quot; &quot;Can I see your driver&#39;s license? I saw you driving over here right now.&quot; &quot;Well, why didn&#39;t you pull me at that point?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&quot;Well, you want to get smart with me?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No. I just know my rights. Why didn&#39;t you pull me over at that point? Why you have to let me go into the store and wait until I came out. And now you want me to pull me over? When I&#39;m not even the back of the wheel, she is.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no traffic violation?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They put me down driving on a suspended license.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like he had no-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No reason.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I guess to phrase it as a question, did you feel like you were being profiled?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point, yes. But it was the law. He was the sheriff. How am I going to go against a sheriff? There&#39;s no way for me to win. So, they arrested me. And then, I was going to go out. I was going out with... What was it called? A suspended license and I had to do classes, community service, and a bunch of stuff, and pay some fines. But at that point, they call immigration. So, I had immigration hold. From there, I just got deported.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did that process take between when the cop got you at the grocery store and when you left the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was probably like a Friday, so the court, I had to wait there until Monday. From Monday, immigration picked me up. And I got transported to ... What was it? I can&#39;t remember the name of the facility. It was all the way up north.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North Orange County?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Way, way more.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North California?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;North California. I got detained right there for almost three months. I thought I could win. I would say I have my kids. I had two kids at that point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are your kids all U.S. citizens?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were all born at the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Basically, they took four hours from ____ just to go see me, four hours. So, it was a long drive. It was almost by ... You know where the Bay is to go to San Francisco? I can&#39;t remember the name of it. They got me a lawyer. My lawyer said, &quot;Yeah, I could get you out and everything.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right.&quot; When it was the final day, he didn&#39;t show up. My lawyer didn&#39;t show up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, the judge said, &quot;I can&#39;t wait any longer. I have to proceed.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Well, if you have to proceed, well, proceed. My lawyer is not here. I don&#39;t know anything about laws.&quot; &quot;Well, your petition, it&#39;s declined. You&#39;re deported for 10 years.&quot; So, I got deported for 10 years. &quot;So, if you break it, you&#39;re looking for some time.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you at this point?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I should say I was 24, somewhere around that, 25.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were deported at 24, came back to Mexico? And how long did you stay?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Mexico, I only stayed for almost a month.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then you&#39;re back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Basically, like I said I had my best friend. People said like, &quot;Are you brothers?&quot; Because we look alike. He let me borrow his papers and just walk in. He asked me, &quot;Citizenship? U.S. citizen?&rdquo; &ldquo;There you go.&rdquo; &nbsp;&ldquo;Thank you.&rdquo; That&#39;s how I made it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how long were you back in the US for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably until November.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean November of that year or November of this past year?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This year. Past year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So a long time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. This time I got deported for 20 years. Well, volunteer, but I cannot go into the US for 20 years. At that point, I&#39;m all like Orange County, probably they were just... I got lucky too because when I went back, I got, getting pulling over. They were just getting me citations and all that. I paid him. But at that point, I didn&#39;t got hold. I only got my ticket. Then I&#39;m all like, &quot;I&#39;m out of here.&quot; I decided to move to Ventura County. &quot;I&#39;m out of here.&quot; I&#39;m like, it&#39;s better for me to run than stay and get into more trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We decided to start fresh. I started working portable restroom rentals. I started working for a company. The owner told me, &quot;You&#39;re a hard worker and everything.&quot; I said like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Then, he told me, &quot;You want to drive?&quot; &quot;I don&#39;t have a license.&quot; &quot;I can get a license if you just need me to prove one. You can get a license for some money.&rdquo; I was like, &quot;All right.&quot; So, he even let me borrow the money, the owner of the company. The owner wanted to collect-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To get a license?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Then from there, just start working, driving, and everything. It was nice. So, I got to learn how to drive big trucks. I had a Isuzu 18-footer. Then, I had to learn how to pull a trailer, an 18.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, I got really experienced on that. I managed to do good things. Plus, because when I had to do some service on it, service on the restrooms or anything, I always talk to the customers, get to meet them, have a bonding with the customers. They already knew me by my name. &quot;Hey, how you doing?&quot; &quot;Hey, you want to drink or something?&quot; &quot;No, I&#39;m driving.&quot; Were all like, &quot;No, not like that. You want a soda or something?&quot; &quot;Yeah, sure.&quot; &quot;Hey, if you ever need anything, just let us know.&quot; &quot;Thank you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got to meet a lot of people like that, really nice. One time I had to fix my roof because it had leak. I told one of the roofers, &quot;Hey, you know what? This is what&#39;s going on.&quot; I said like, &quot;What do I have to buy?&quot; &quot;What&#39;s going on?&quot; &quot;Well, it&#39;s leaking. I have to replace the roof.&quot; &quot;Take that, this, and this, and that.&quot; &quot;How much is it?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m not charging you. Just take it.&quot; &quot;All right.&rdquo; &ldquo;I&#39;ll tell the company that they&#39;re not charging for this month&#39;s service.&quot; &quot;Don&#39;t worry about it. I&#39;m okay.&quot; &quot;All right.&quot; Basically, you get to know a lot of people like that, like really nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It sounds like you had good relationships with people through work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. At the end, I had a tragic accident. The owner bought a new pump truck. It wasn&#39;t my day. It was a day that unfortunately my dad passed away. It was 2017. It was that year. Actually, this is going to be a year that he passed away.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m so sorry to hear that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That really hurt. It really hurt me. Everything was going down. I felt like the world was just&hellip; it was just too much for me. I managed to stay up and everything and that day... I had a bad feeling, but I had to go and do my services.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You could sense something bad might happen?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, something happen. I wasn&#39;t comfortable. I was feeling my chest was compressed. I&#39;m like, &quot;Something&#39;s going to happen. I know that something&#39;s going to happen.&quot; It was my last stop. I finished it. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nothing happened. I&#39;m glad.&quot; On my way back to the yard, a lady just&hellip; ran a red light. I had a pump truck. It was 950-gallon pump truck. I was full to the top. I couldn&#39;t stop the truck. I T-boned her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And we went into a ditch. We went down. The only thing I remember is just jumping out of the pump truck, running to her, tried to help her. She passed away in my hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m so sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She saw me and I looked at her. She had two car seats, two child car seats. I look around and see if there were kids or anything, there weren&#39;t. She still had her phone on her lap. I was like, &quot;Son of a bitch. Why you had to be on the phone?&quot; And she just look at me. I just remember her face looking at me. Just taking a big breath and she just passed away. Right in my hands.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They took me to the hospital, I remember. The sheriff went over there and the CHP took me. &quot;Do you have a license?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; They knew me by a different name at work. But since that tragic happened, I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m not going to run away. I&#39;m not going to say anything that&#39;s not.&quot; I gave my real name, everything. I was like, &quot;If it was my fault, then I&#39;ll pay for it. I have to step up and meet the consequences.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s so tragic for her and for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She left two kids behind. Laying down in bed and just&hellip; the CHP just told me you&#39;re going to get charged for undriver license with unvolunteer mansl-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Involuntary manslaughter?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. I&#39;m like, &quot;If I&#39;m guilty, how much time am I looking at?&quot; I can&#39;t remember if he said more than 10 years, probably. My life just getting better and better. I just lost my dad. Now, this is happening. I&#39;m like, &quot;My life is going down already.&rdquo; What to expect?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you decide to leave voluntarily?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Basically, I stayed. I stayed there. Immigration didn&#39;t came for me or anything, they just get my information. I was going to court. Then, my final notice where I was renting, they didn&#39;t give me my mail. So it was a year past, and they didn&#39;t get my mail. So, it turned into a warrant. So, the sheriff went to my house. There were six officers at gunpoint, said, &quot;Don&#39;t even try anything because we have orders to shoot.&quot; &quot;Look, I&#39;m not running. I&#39;m not doing anything.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they took me in and then I told the judge&hellip; Well, basically, I got the public defender at that point. So like, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you show up?&quot; So like, &quot;I didn&#39;t get my mail. If I wanted to run at the beginning, I should just give a false information. I would have give out wrong information and that&#39;s it. I would be free. I wouldn&#39;t be here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you were totally honest.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wasn&#39;t going to run. I tried to help her and she died in my hands. The public defender talked to the judge and everything. The judge ran my... He&#39;s like, &quot;Well, it seems that you have no record or anything, that you&rsquo;re dragging. I&#39;m going to consider you released. You&#39;re released.&quot; So I got released at that point, but downstairs I was waiting for my release when immigration show up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;re released on bail?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not bail. It was&mdash;what&#39;s the other one?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Bond? Or that you were acquitted?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Acquitted probably, I should say.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the charges were dropped?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No. No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were released in the-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My own word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So yes, you didn&#39;t have to pay bail or bond but on your own? Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But he told me, &quot;I&#39;m going to need you to show up to every single court. If you miss at least one court date, I&#39;m going to put you behind bars until the case closes.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right.&quot; So, they took me downstairs to wait for my release. When they called my name, but&hellip; I was something like, &quot;Okay. I&#39;m out. Well, where&#39;s my clothes?&quot; Someone like, &quot;You&#39;re not changing dude.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Why? I&#39;m not going to get released or out?&quot; He said, &quot;You&#39;re not going to get released. You&#39;re going back to Mexico, dude.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;Who are you?&quot; He was like, &quot;You know who I am.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No. I don&#39;t know you. You haven&#39;t even present yourself or anything.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m ICE.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He said that, &quot;I&#39;m ICE&quot;?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay. Well, nice to meet you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did he tell you his name?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhhh&hellip; You know what, I&rsquo;m&hellip; not really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just ICE?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just ICE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s his name.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, &quot;Okay. Well, I was getting released.&quot; &quot;No, you&#39;re not. You&#39;re going back to Mexico.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right. Well, can I get my phone call?&quot; Because at the beginning, they didn&#39;t even give me the right to make a phone call when I got into custody. &quot;Well, I&#39;m going to make a phone call. At least, to let my family know what&#39;s going on.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re not getting a phone call right now until we get to the facility.&quot; &quot;I&#39;m in the facility, right?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, but you&#39;re under our hold now. So, you&#39;re not getting one until we get to our facility.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay.&quot; So I try to get in some conversation and everything. I was like, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When we were in the police car, ICE car basically, at the point I knew that if I would get mad where in he puts his hands on me, I knew I couldn&rsquo;t have a case right there because he was really, really rude and said, like, really sarcastic. So, I&#39;m like, okay. You want to play the sarcastic game. Okay. Well, let&#39;s play. So, I started talking with him. In one of them, he said, &quot;Since I started working for ICE, no one has escaped me.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;All right. So, where you used to work before, before you did this?&quot; &quot;I was at the line. I always get my guys.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay. So probably, you should teach your other guys because,&quot; I told him, &quot;this is the fifth time I have crossed through the line.&quot; I was like, &quot;This is the five, fifth time.&quot; &quot;Where you crossed from?&quot; I was like, &quot;He opened the door for me.&quot; I played the sarcastic game. &quot;What do you mean?&quot; &quot;I just go to the line. I&#39;m a US citizen and just walk in.&quot; They even say, &quot;Walk in. Welcome.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I knew, he changed his face right there. He got mad. So I was like, &quot;Well, you need to teach them more. They don&#39;t get enough training then.&quot; &quot;How long are you gonna... Are you gonna come back?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah. I might be coming back probably next week. So, I&#39;ll be seeing you again hopefully, to say hi.&quot; So, I knew he was getting pissed off. I&#39;m like, &quot;Nah.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that point when we got to the facility, the other guys, they were nice. He was the only one. He was being an ass. There was someone like, &quot;Hey, you know what? I don&#39;t have a jacket or anything. Can you turn down the...&quot; because it was getting cold. He was like, &quot;You know what? I can&#39;t.&rdquo; &ldquo;You know what? Here&#39;s a sweater. Have you ate already?&quot; &quot;No.&quot; He was like, &quot;Here.&quot; He gave me two burritos, fruit, and everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, they treated you a little bit better?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Then from there, it just took like a week. A week, and then-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you were back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you&#39;ve been back here about eight months now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well right now, if I go back, I have to think about it really closely because if I get caught, I&#39;m going to be behind bars. No matter what. And then get deported again. If I go back, there has to be no mistakes from my part, and from the part that the person that&#39;s going to help me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How would you have no mistakes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Basically if I go back, I&#39;m going to use the same identification. Everything&#39;s the same. Last time, there was a mistake. They bought a car. But the car was&hellip; On the exhaust, there was chemical coming off from the car. It took me to the secondary check, but I&#39;m asked to cross over. So at this time, I have to get everything, the car has to be checked right away, and the timing has to be correct because you have to look at their officers and see the officers who&#39;s taking their time to check everything the right way, and who&#39;s just lying it. So, you have to study them basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like they study us, you have to study them too. You have to know them and see where are there some blank spots. If I get the right one, they can just say, &quot;Walk in. Walk in.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, we only have a couple of minutes left but I want to hear a little bit about what these past eight or nine months have been like for you in Mexico. Your wife and your family, adjusting to life here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, basically my wife, I got good news from her. It&rsquo;s, she just got residence.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She got residence?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So on that part&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Congratulations to her and you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;I&#39;m happy for her. Job, I just got basically layoff for one single mistake, doesn&#39;t consider probably firing people like that. Here, just taking care of my mom economically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is she here in Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, with my grandpa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you live with her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. She decided to move over here and then I just followed her after that. Well, not follow, they brought me here. Since then, I had been taking care of her. I was working for TTech for almost&hellip; Since January until November, almost five months. From five months, saving, plus I was sending money to my wife a little bit, but it&#39;s not going to be big, but at least it&#39;s something for the kids. Right now, they&#39;re planning to come over.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re planning to come here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, just to visit. She told me if I can help her out with airplanes tickets. Well, I&#39;m not working. Hopefully, I&#39;m going to start looking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you seen them since?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, only FaceTime, through FaceTime. They&#39;re struggling a little bit, but I have a strong wife. She&#39;s amazing. She has been managing, and I&#39;m really proud of her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How are your kids doing without you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My kid, the oldest one, when I was over there, I was on top of them on school. So now, he&#39;s struggling.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He doesn&#39;t have that leash?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. So right now, he&#39;s struggling. He was in honors. Now, he wants to go home study. I&#39;m like, &quot;No. No way.&quot; He was more affected, probably I should say because emotionally, he&#39;s probably depressed because I&#39;m not there. But like I told him, &quot;We&#39;ll be together one more time. Don&#39;t worry.&quot; I tried to motivate him as much as I can from here. I can&#39;t do much, but a little bit counts.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think the U.S. can do, the government or otherwise in the U.S. to help families in your situation, deportees, and the family members left behind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I cannot say to help them economically because it&#39;s like they say, &quot;They don&#39;t have that same right as someone that&#39;s originally from there.&quot; But at least to give them a chance, a fighting chance basically. Some people, probably they&#39;re afraid when they shouldn&#39;t be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You mean, U.S. citizens being afraid of migrants, or you mean migrants being afraid of-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because sometimes migrants they won&#39;t talk or anything because from my experience, it was just a traffic infraction. And from that infraction, they call immigration. So basically, if they would stop at least doing that, that will open more doors for more people to feel more confident in getting the police involved because there&#39;s a lot of things that they&rsquo;re happening and people, they&#39;re not saying anything because of that reason. &quot;Oh, if I do this, the sheriff will call them.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one of the reasons that this time was happened to me. The ICE, the officer, he even told me, &quot;They even call us. We didn&#39;t even knew that you were back. They call us to come and pick you up.&quot; I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; So, we can&#39;t even trust in our own sheriffs? Now, sheriffs are doing the job of someone else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, so, there&#39;s a feeling of mistrust and not wanting to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;True.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&mdash;or maybe feeling like you have to stay in the shadows more?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s for the same reason that people won&#39;t talk. They&#39;ll see a crime or something, they&#39;re quiet. Why? Because the sheriff, they lost that trust already. Now, the sheriff is becoming ICE.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that contributes to there being more crime in communities that undocumented people live?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, I&#39;ve been in both places, in bad and good, drugs or whatever. I know a bunch of stuff and I have seen. And people just won&#39;t say anything. Why? Because I have seen it. Because like for me, I can tell you names, addresses, everything. People have a duty. I mean, people that they&#39;re trafficking. How many people I can take down, but for what? So, I can get in trouble too?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s one of the reason.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you&#39;re not going to call the police?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s correct. Why? Because the police will turn me into ICE or do something. No. I know people that&mdash;they&#39;re probably been going through the same stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure many people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of stuff going.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I really appreciate how open you&#39;ve been about sharing your story. You have a very powerful story and I do think that it&#39;s going to be helpful for people to hear stories like yours to hear in your own words, your experiences as a migrant. It&#39;s like these little things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there&#39;s just little stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The little traffic violations. You&#39;re a good employee, a good father. It&#39;s really, really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of stuff. Just for small stuff, even neighbors. Neighbors calling. One time we were arguing with me and my wife. Who doesn&#39;t argue? The neighbor just called the cops. I got charged as domestic violence. Come on. For just arguing with my wife, it&#39;s considered domestic violence?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your wife get charged with anything?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I was just the only one. Why? Because I had priors, traffic priors and everything. So I&#39;m like, &quot;Nice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably it doesn&#39;t help build that sense of community if you feel your neighbors are trying to&mdash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s one of the reasons that I decided to move to Ventura County because my neighbors, probably they thought already I was a violent person and everything. My other neighbor, they were old people. They&#39;re aged. I&#39;m always helping them. &quot;Hey, how are you doing? Hi.&quot; I still have contact with them through Face. I put up a picture on Face and said like, &quot;You&#39;re always so serious, but you know what? You&#39;re always responsible.&quot; That made my day.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They said that to you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so I was like, &quot;Wow.&quot; I even call them my grandmas. &quot;Hey, grandma. How are you doing?&quot; &quot;Hey, sweetie.&quot; Over 30 years, now coming over here, starting a new life, it&#39;s kind of difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On that note, my last question for you. So, you were born in Mexico. You&#39;re in Mexico now. The majority of your life was in the US. Do you consider yourself Mexican, an American, both, neither?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t even know now. I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t even know where I belong now. My life is over there, but I was born here. Part of my life, six years I was raised here. Now, I go and coming back. I&#39;m Mexican, but I have all my life over there. Where am I considered now? That&#39;s one of the things that I have to figure it out now, if I&#39;m from here, or from over there? I know the languages. I know the rules. I have everything. I always follow the rules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Jose Luis:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here, you don&#39;t have to follow the rules. So, it&#39;s two different things. At first, I have to set up my mind that I have to stay here. I belong here. But honestly, I can&#39;t adapt yet. I can&#39;t. It&#39;s getting hard for me, not economically but emotionally, because I&#39;m used to a whole different life, a whole different lifestyle. Here, it&#39;s a whole different thing.</span></p><p class="c1 c5"><span class="c0"></span></p></body></html>
