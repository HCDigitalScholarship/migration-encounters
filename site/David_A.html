They can be painful, the memories.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I kind of have an idea of what they are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Anyway, so we can start just asking you a little bit about, when was it that you first came to the US, and how did you feel about it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time I came to the US, I was two and a half, so I don&#39;t ... I remember a lot of things. I remember being taken over the border when I was a baby. I can remember being on the bottom of the truck. I was in ... You know the trucks, in the passenger seat, the co-pilot has this space right under?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I hid under there the first time, and I kind of remember that, and it feels strange. I wouldn&#39;t say it feels bad, but it feels strange, because you don&#39;t know what&#39;s going on, and you&#39;re just told to ... or you only see things, and you&#39;re traveling. Or that&#39;s what I saw, at least. I saw that I was traveling, but then again, I was just a baby, two and a half. But I remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that your first-ever memory?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really, no. My first memory I have? I remember my mom and my dad on a bed. That&#39;s my first memory, but I was like, maybe eight months. I remember the scenario, the room. I remember where I was, where they were laying, the TV, a few portraits. I remember that. That&#39;s my first memory.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you came at two and a half. And why did your parents take you to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, they had a bit of a problem. They separated, so I didn&#39;t really know what the problem was until I was like, 24. And when I was 24, they told me what happened, but it&#39;s a very big problem. I don&#39;t talk to my parents because of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And the reason ... Well, how do you say it? When you cheat on someone? That was the problem. My dad used to be very popular with women, so yeah. Well, he had another home for another person, another woman. And my mom found out with my auntie, so they did something ... That&#39;s how Mexican women are. They do have to do something about that, always.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they found out. They took her stuff out. My dad had bought things for that other woman, so that was the reason. And she left. She left when I was two and a half. She just decided to ... First, we were living in Quer&eacute;taro, where I was born. And she came back to el Estado de M&eacute;xico [the State of Mexico]. So, she came back. And then next day, she just left. She had some cousins in San Diego that are Americans. They were born there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re Mexican descent, but they were born there. So, there&#39;s a kid that&#39;s my cousin. </span><span>So h</span><span class="c0">e&#39;s the same age as me. So, that&#39;s how they passed me over the border. That was the first time. And, well, yeah. That was the problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it was you and your mom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just me and my mom, and her cousin, which is the one that helped her. And yeah, just me and her. Yup.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what are your early memories of the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Early memories of the US, well, my mom started working for a maid company, a cleaning company. Not really maid, but she was a maid. She had to clean a few houses. So, my first memories were cleaning houses with her when I was little. Kind of enjoyed that. You meet a lot of people, nice people. American people are pretty nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you went to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, preschool, and then elementary. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you make friends quickly?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. I kind of make friends real quick. But at that moment, I had a few friends. Don&#39;t remember them at the moment, but I remember their faces. I remember a few names when I was in preschool, but I just remember their faces. I don&#39;t really, like ... I remember one in special.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Her name was Katie. She used to go to preschool with me, and then she went with me until first grade. She used to be the daughter of this lady that we used to clean the house for, so she used to go to this small school in Oakland, but it was a small elementary school, so I think that lady helped her for me to get into that school for that year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I had to leave. I had to go to the elementary school, the public elementary school. And I remember her because we used to go everywhere. Her mom and my mom were really ... I don&#39;t know. They connected. She was American. My mom was Mexican, but they connected and they were friends.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I remember her because of that. We used to go everywhere. I remember Katie a lot. I still remember, I have a few pictures of her. And there&#39;s this picture that I still have. We&#39;re on this little Western cabin. You know those Western, I don&#39;t know, wagons? And we took a picture there because it was cool. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were in San Diego, you said?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. I passed over to San Diego, but they took me the same day, we went until we reached Oakland. So, they just drove. I mean, I remember just the trip, and then we stopped, and then now I know that that was Oakland, right? But at that moment, I didn&#39;t really know. But yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And how far did you go in school in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got up to seventh grade. I was in this private Catholic school. Well, I went to a preschool. Then, I went to a few elementary schools, that small elementary school that I don&#39;t remember the name. And then ______ Elementary, and then ______ Elementary. And then, from ______ Elementary, since I had good grades, there was this program called &quot;Making Waves.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after school, this yellow bus used to pick me up at the school and take me to another school that was called &quot;Making Waves,&quot; and they helped us with our homework. They helped us with everything. I mean, I had pretty cool teachers, friends from other schools. They would put us in small groups with a teacher. It was up to five or six kids per teacher.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all of the teachers were really cool. I still remember them. Mr. Labarca, and the other two teachers. I remember their names, but not at the moment. And then, at the same time, when I was in seventh grade, at this private Catholic school, that&#39;s when my dad found me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was almost finishing seventh grade. It was in March, so I had two more months. And then, just all of a sudden, one day, I was voiced on the interphone. That&#39;s how you say it, &quot;interphone&quot;? And I was voiced and that was really not something normal, because I was this little kid that just did homework. I used to tuck my shirt in because my mom didn&#39;t like my shirt out, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was voiced that day, and all my friends were like, &quot;What did you do? You were never called. What&#39;s wrong with you?&quot; I wasn&#39;t a troubled kid. And yeah, I went to the office, and then all of a sudden, this ... How do you say it? The social worker?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The social worker was there with two guys, and just her with these two guys. And I think that one of them was a driver and the other one was the co-pilot, and she was in the back with me. Yeah, I remember that day because all my friends were ... They all watched. They all were like, &quot;David, you didn&#39;t come back to classes, and then what&#39;s wrong?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, all my friends were like, &quot;Where&#39;s David, and where&#39;s David?&quot; And then, I think that was one of the saddest days I&#39;ve had in my life, because I remember my friends at the gate, and I used to have this like, girlfriend. I didn&#39;t really pay much attention to her, but she used to say I was her girlfriend, so I would just go with it, you know? I didn&#39;t want to hurt her feelings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But yeah, and she was at the gate, so I kind of felt bad because of that. And the car just didn&#39;t stop, so I didn&#39;t get to say goodbye or anything. And, yeah. I was taken to this house, where this ... I don&#39;t mean to be rude or anything, but the house really stank. I remember the smell. And she was this African-American lady. She used to be the one that took care of the kids that have problems, legal problems.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I looked on the bright side and I met two friends, two girl friends and a boy friend, a kid. And well, we connected. We had the same type of issues. We were legal problem kids, if I would put it that way. And yeah, we connected and we used to just laugh about the smell, because really, it was horrible. And she used to cook really ... I don&#39;t know what she used to cook, because I didn&#39;t eat it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I lived there for a week, and these kids were there for like a month. One of them was there for three months, and then the other one was there for two months, and then the other one was there for three weeks, and then I was there just the week.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about your mom?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom, well, she wasn&#39;t notified. She wasn&#39;t notified. I don&#39;t really know what happened at that time with her, because I haven&#39;t talked to her about that. I&#39;ve asked her, but she doesn&#39;t really like to talk about those things. Don&#39;t know why. I mean, maybe I do, but don&#39;t pay much attention to it because of her character and how she is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, yeah. She told me a few things. She was notified that my dad found me. I was found by this program here in Mexico that&#39;s ... How can I put it? You know how they used to put kids&#39; faces on the milk cartons, and then they appear on TV?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they appear on TV with this program that says on the TV, &ldquo;Se les avisa, han comunicado para la comunidad&rdquo; [They are notified, they have communicated with the community]. Something like that. And well, they found me there on the TV one day. They dialed the number, and then they saw the carton, and someone just called, and said I was in States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was the first time. The first time was with the carton, and then that&#39;s how my dad found me in _____. So, then one day, my dad went to _____ and just talked to my mom, but my mom was with my stepdad. They were barely starting to know each other.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he went there. He lied to her, and then next day, I was on a train back to Mexico when I was three, three and a half. And he was just like, &quot;Grab a toy. Grab a ...&quot; He grabbed a few of my clothes, and just, we got on a Amtrak train from _____ to ... I don&#39;t really remember. I think it was all the way to _____. I remember the longest trip of my life on a train. That&#39;s the only time I&#39;ve been on a train, but it was way too long.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, from _____, I think someone went for us. Someone picked us up there. And then I was here in Mexico, in a Mexican preschool. I was there for six months, and then my mom came back. Came back, and she had a legal problem at my school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My grandma&#39;s house is right next to an elementary school and a little preschool. So one day, when she came back, she was like, &quot;Hey, that&#39;s my kid.&quot; And she was trying to take me from the school, but here in Mexico, that&#39;s not allowed.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, then the school called the federals and there was this big problem there, and my mom was detained, and I was taken again by the social ... Well, that was the first time a social worker took me. And then we went-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was in Mexico, yeah. That was El DIF [National System for Integral Family Development]. El DIF took me, and they had this like, &quot;What are you doing? This is your kid. What&#39;s wrong with you guys?&quot; They were talking to them, right? So, the attorney here in Mexico decided that I had to stay with my dad. I don&#39;t know why, but they were telling my mom that she took me for abduction to another country.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he wanted to sue because of that, and well, her attorney was just like, &quot;I&#39;ll help you guys go out the back door.&quot; And she did. She helped us leave out the back door. She helped my mom, one auntie, and my two grandparents and me. And she was like, &quot;Okay, leave.&quot; Because the laws here in Mexico are very favorable for men when these types of things happen, and yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, how old were you when you went back to the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was three and a half. I was three and a half, because my fourth year, my birthday was in the States. I remember that day. Yeah. And yeah, I went back. My mom just took me that day and we crossed the border again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you feel like a ping-pong ball, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right. Yeah. You just said what I say all the time. I say that to them all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, seventh grade, your dad found you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He found me. He found me, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Brought you back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, he brought me back. He won the custody. He hired this attorney, because that&#39;s when the picture on the TV came up, and yeah. He found me because of that, and it was a week. It was two court hearings, and then I came back like a week after he won the custody because there were no tickets. It was very casual. There were no tickets to come back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they made my mom pay the tickets for me and my dad, which I think was really ... I don&#39;t think that was really necessary, my mom had to pay the ticket for my dad. I mean, really? And yeah, I came back. And I was given a choice. His attorney just told me to decide if ... I had two options.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would go back with my dad, or I would go back with my mom. And my mom had my sister and my little brother, so they&#39;re American citizens, so I think I made the toughest decision of my life there, because I decided to leave my mom with my brother and my sister, and obviously with my stepdad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, I told the judge that I wanted to go to Mexico with my dad, which really ... I think I wasn&#39;t really given time to think about it. I didn&#39;t really know what was going on, and the decision was just like, from an hour and then just decide. And I was like, &quot;What?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re a 13-year-old kid, or ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 10 and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were 10 and a half?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yup. And yeah, I decided to come back. And I came back here. They didn&#39;t want to have me study ... Here in Mexico, seventh grade is </span><span class="c2">primero de secundaria</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[first grade of middle school], and they didn&#39;t give me the certificate for that, so I had to start that year all over again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, my dad had to pay a few bucks. A few pesos, I&#39;m sorry. A few pesos, so I could get a certificate for here in Mexico, the elementary school, like a constancy that says that I studied elementary school in the states, and I have that paper that says that I studied elementary, so I can prove that I have my elementary school here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I started school here. I had to learn Spanish real quick. I didn&#39;t really speak a lot of Spanish, because I didn&#39;t really ... I had a tough mom. She was really tough on me. I think I would thank her and be mad at her, but I don&#39;t know. Just don&#39;t kind of give a thought on that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she used to make me study hard, so here in Mexico, I had to learn Spanish real quick, and I used to just speak English in the States, because I used to study all the time. So, I didn&#39;t really get a time to speak Spanish. I didn&#39;t really get times with my family, because I used to come back from school like at 7:30, and it was just, &quot;Oh, you finished your homework? Here&#39;s more homework.&quot; I know how to write cursive, or how do you ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know how to write that because of her, so that&#39;s something I would thank her for. And yeah, I used to finish my homework, and then I used to have more homework from her. And here in Mexico, well, it was really different. And it was the toughest decision of my life to come here to Mexico, because here, my dad was just like, the complete opposite of my mom.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He just didn&#39;t care about ... Well, I wouldn&#39;t say that he didn&#39;t care. Sorry. He didn&#39;t know how to help me with my homework. He didn&#39;t know how to, maybe, even talk to me, so yeah. </span><span>Kind of,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;had a lot of problems because of that, because he thinks that I hate him. I don&#39;t really hate him. It&#39;s just that he doesn&#39;t know how to be a parent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;ve tried to be a son, but it doesn&#39;t work with him. We have the same type of character. If he says that chair is red, and even though you prove to him that that chair is gray, he&#39;ll still say that it&#39;s red. And that&#39;s just something that ... We don&#39;t get along, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&#39;t know how to teach me math. Well, math, I already knew. I had a great teacher. I had a great teacher in that Catholic school. She was awesome. She was like 86 or something years old, but she used to teach math really good. I learned math from the States, that here, was already like, in high school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I was like, I didn&#39;t really know what to do. I used to not even do my homework because it was like, &quot;I&#39;ve already seen that.&quot; And yeah, I had a lot of problems with teachers, English teachers most of the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, did you finish high school here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I finished high school when I was 22, 23. 23, and it took a long time. I left my house, my grandparents&#39; house. I left my grandparents&#39; house when I was 16, so I had to work, not because they don&#39;t want me or anything, but they kicked my dad out. So, if they kicked my dad out, I was like, &quot;Well, what am I supposed to do?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I left first because he didn&#39;t want to leave. He didn&#39;t want to leave his parents&#39; house, so I left when I was 16, because he didn&#39;t want to leave. And I left to the house that was my grandmother&#39;s house, and then now, it&#39;s my dad&#39;s house. The heritage, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now it&#39;s my dad&#39;s house. I lived there since I was 16, so I used to help him out with the house, like pay the light, pay the bills, stuff like that. Didn&#39;t pay rent, because he&#39;s my dad. But then, he started to ask for rent when we had a lot of problems. He thought ... My girlfriend used to live with me, so he thought I was going to make life and stuff like that. But not really. He doesn&#39;t know anything about me, since I was 11.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are you now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;26.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;ve never been back to the States since seventh grade?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what kind of work do you do now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By the way, you speak impeccable English.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s been a long time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;ve had a lot of practice. I&#39;ve been here for 16, 17 years almost. And I always used to have some headphones on my head when I was a child. I think that helped. I used to read J.K. Rowling. My mom gave me the three first books from the States, so I brought them back with me, and the Goosebumps books. And a few other books, like ... Well, I used to read in English a lot, and I used to hear music from the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like all of my teens, I used to hear English music. I didn&#39;t hear Spanish music at all, because I didn&#39;t like it. And I used to just sing. I sing pretty good. Well, I don&#39;t sing that bad. And that helped me. I think that helped me, because the pronunciation, sometimes, in the songs is very unique, so that helps you. And yeah, I used to listen a lot of music. Yeah. Thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so, what kind of work do you do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, work. Well, when I was 16, I left, I did a lot of jobs. I&#39;ve had up to 35 jobs now and counting. So, this is the 36th job I&#39;m at. And since</span><span>&hellip;</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;</span><span>m</span><span class="c0">ost of the times, I&#39;ve worked for call centers, and that helped. When I was 17, almost 18, I entered the first call center, that&#39;s right over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I was there for maybe like, two months. And I had this problem with my mom, because I started to work, and she was like, &quot;Why are you working if your dad has a lot of money?&quot; And blah, blah, blah. And she used to just say bad things about him, so I couldn&#39;t work. I just had to leave. I was there two months.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I worked for this guy, a Mexican architect that&#39;s pretty ... Well, he does a lot of jobs here in Mexico. He does the bridges, like most of the bridges are done because of him. And I used to work for him for like a year. I was the guy that was at night, night shift from 10:00 to 10:00, and I used to do, like the structure, like the ... How tall it&#39;s going to be, how many inches, the ... I forgot the word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, drafting?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The drafting. Drafting, and I used to use auto-cut, or ... Yeah, I used to use that. And since he was an architect, he had these brigades of topography, so I was in charge of giving the equipment for them. I used to take care of it, because Mexico is full of people that just want to steal every moment.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, he hired me because of that. And of course, it helped that his daughter was my girlfriend, but yeah. I mean, it was just a year, so. And he also had this water ... How do you say it? Here in Mexico, there&#39;s this little business that purifies water, like just that person. So he had one of those, too. So I was also in charge of giving the water to the guy, and yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, I was there for a year and then came back to </span><span>Teletech</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;for two years ... No, two years, eight months, almost? And I don&#39;t know how it lasted that long, but I used to have a lot of problems at that moment with my dad and my mom and everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after that, I had a few jobs. I quit call centers, and just decided to do other types of jobs, like hard work. I used to deliver magazines for </span><span>Televisa</span><span class="c0">, and that&#39;s a pretty hard job here in Mexico. Tried that for a month, and it was like, &quot;No, I speak English. What am I doing here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, then I tried a few other call centers. I&#39;ve been in six or seven, maybe, or more. And I&#39;ve worked in a few English schools. I&#39;ve worked in quick learning. I&#39;ve worked in English, and the one that&#39;s purple. What&#39;s this ... I forgot the name. It&#39;s a purple logo, but I&#39;ve been in those.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, and then I came back to call centers. Yeah. Oh, and I worked in a fitness gym. You know, a fitness gym. I studied a martial art. It&#39;s called &quot;Limalama.&quot; So, that helped me. I&#39;m a black belt. And because of that, I got this job at this gym. It&#39;s called 9 Round And I worked there for a year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I worked at this place for leads, making leads. That&#39;s pretty awesome. These Samsung machines are fast, and they make leads real quick, like all of those types of things, I saw. And I really liked it, but the pay was really low. I was trying to get a job there for something related to English or something like that, but I had to have a career. So, I don&#39;t have a career yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I went back to call centers, because I liked that job, really. Making leads is really cool. Making everything inside it ... I don&#39;t know how to say it in English right now, but capacitors? All of those things that are related with the electronics and stuff, these machines just assemble them real quick and I used to just use the computers, and they&#39;re in English, so that was pretty easy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#39;t at all hard. And I had a little problem because of that, because again, people here in Mexico are just weird. They&#39;re just ... I don&#39;t know. They see someone speaking English, and instead of asking to learn, or letting themselves be taught English, they do the opposite. So, I had a lot of problems there, so I had to leave. And now I&#39;m here, at another call center. And it&#39;s called CCSI.&quot; A</span><span>nd...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s a new one.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s a new one. They&#39;re here in Mexico maybe for a year and a half, two years. So, yeah. That&#39;s pretty cool, and I was working for this ... </span><span>Frontier</span><span class="c5">. For </span><span>Frontier, </span><span class="c5">tech support, but then </span><span>Frontier</span><span class="c5">&nbsp;decided to go to </span><span>TKM</span><span class="c0">, another company.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, I just decided to stay here, and they&#39;re giving us </span><span>Pizza Hut </span><span class="c5">calls. </span><span>Pizza Hut </span><span class="c5">&nbsp;has a call center now. That&#39;s pretty cool. Yeah. People tell me that a lot, on the calls. They get amazed that now, </span><span>Pizaa Hut_</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;has a call center, and they&#39;re like, &quot;No. What&#39;s wrong? Is this the store? Can you transfer me to the store?&quot; And they don&#39;t trust us, because obviously, they don&#39;t know where we are, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then you&#39;re like, &quot;I can place your order there, carryout or delivery, and I can find a store for you.&quot; And it really helps that ... You&#39;re mentioning that my English is pretty good, so it really helps, because I see my other friends, or how do you say? Coworkers, that don&#39;t speak or don&#39;t have the same level of English. I see it all the time, that they have trouble because of that, and they&#39;re like, &quot;Are you in Mexico?&quot; And they&#39;re like ... They hang up. They hang up, or sometimes they ask for a supervisor or stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t even have an accent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know even where my accent is from, really, because ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;_____.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, would you say living in the US changed you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I&#39;d say it made me, because I was two and a half. So, I think the United States made me. Here in Mexico, that changed me a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know if, in the States, there&#39;s a term for what Mexicans do here. They do a lot of </span><span class="c2">albur</span><span class="c5">. (word play &ndash; double entendre) I don&#39;t know if you know anything about that, </span><span class="c2">los albures</span><span class="c0">? Like, speaking in two ... In second term, &nbsp;or trying to say something with other words to a person. You know, like bullying stuff, or stuff like, whenever you&#39;re trying to make fun of someone, but you use other words, and then you just rhyme it up together.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I don&#39;t like that. I&#39;ve had a lot of problems because of that. I had to learn it, because here in Mexico, people are obsessed with that. Some people, really, I&#39;ve met a few friends that do that all the time, since the beginning of maybe a &quot;Hi&quot; or maybe a &quot;What&#39;s up?&quot; or something like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right off of that, they&#39;re just trying to get at you, and it&#39;s like, &quot;Bro, I don&#39;t even ... I understand it, but I don&#39;t like it. Sorry.&quot; So, then I learned that I had to use it, because here, people in Mexico see us as strange people if you don&#39;t like it, so that changed me. I had to learn how to do that. Even though I don&#39;t like it, I still have to do it with the people that are obsessed with it, just to bypass them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah. That changed me, and then I had a few other problems with family problems and girlfriend problems. I started a relationship when I was 16. I was kind of looking forward to what my grandparents are. My grandparents have been married for like 70 ... They&#39;re going for 70 years now. And they&#39;ve taught me a lot. They would be the ones that taught me almost everything here in Mexico, and they&#39;ve taught me how to be a young man.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;ve taught me how to be a good boy. Try to be decent. And yeah, they changed me, because I had a lot of things on my mind. I didn&#39;t speak for like a year here in Mexico, when I arrived, like 10 and a half. I didn&#39;t speak for a year. I used to just play video games. I like, I love video games. So, in that year, I didn&#39;t talk for nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember being in my room, and I don&#39;t know if that changed me, but ... Well, I don&#39;t know how to describe it. Then all of a sudden, my dad was like, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with you? You just play video games. You just eat. You just go to the bathroom, and then video games again and then...&quot; I mean, yeah. What&#39;d you expect? What&#39;d you expect? I&#39;m living in Mexico with you now, and you lied. I mean, I didn&#39;t even ... I could have stayed with my mom, and you lied to me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he didn&#39;t even want to show me the papers of the legal terms and all of that. He thinks that I don&#39;t understand those types of things, but he&#39;s the one that doesn&#39;t understand it. But I&#39;m just like, &quot;Yeah, whatever. I don&#39;t want to discuss that.&quot; And yeah, I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to go back to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To the US? Not really. It&#39;s been too long since I&#39;ve left that aside. I wanted to go when I was like, 14. But then, my mom just was like ... She did everything to not want me to go back. So, I just went with that, and I just thought of it a day and just decided, &quot;Even though she wants me to go back, I&#39;m not going back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve had a few problems with the American Embassy, and she tried, when I was 16, to get my visa. And that didn&#39;t work, because my dad had to sign the papers, and I had to go to Ciudad Ju&aacute;rez the first time, so my dad was like, &quot;I&#39;m not going to take you.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;Whatever. I&#39;ma go on my own.&quot; And then, he didn&#39;t let me leave the house for like a month, because he thought I was going to escape. And I was like, &quot;Yeah. I&#39;m not going to escape. That&#39;s just boring. If I went already twice, what makes you think I&#39;m going to go on my own?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I just decided not to go back. And my mom tried it that first time, but my dad didn&#39;t have properties or a car or a bank account, because he&#39;s a bus driver all his life. And they didn&#39;t give it to him because of that. So, he tried, and they denied it because of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then, she tried it when I was almost 21. I think that my stepdad could still process the papers, and ask for my papers, so she tried it because of that. And at the same time, he was trying to get her papers. But my papers were in the middle too, so if they denied my papers, they denied hers because of her problem with the States because of me, and that&#39;s why they don&#39;t give her her papers. And yeah, I don&#39;t think I want to go back. I just</span><span>&hellip;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I&#39;m too tired of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s ... I don&#39;t really want to talk about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Okay. Well, I think that&#39;s pretty much all of my questions. Is there anything else you want to say about your time in the US, issues associated with migration or returning migrants, anything like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not really. No. I used to love school there. That was pretty cool. I used to look forward to university over there, because I don&#39;t really like universities here. I&#39;ve gotten to know a few, but here in Mexico, everything is so corrupted. I just don&#39;t like it. And I had a lot of trouble getting to school, like to high school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s this exam here in Mexico that is called &quot;CENEVAL,&quot; and they&#39;re the ones that, from the third year in junior high, pass you over to high school. So, I didn&#39;t pass that first test. And I was like, &quot;What? I mean, I&#39;m sure of my answers. I&#39;m really sure that I got the score for that school.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they didn&#39;t put my name in there, and I was like, &quot;What&#39;s wrong with Mexico, man?&quot; And I tried it again, and I tried the second time, and the second time, it was like, I got two below the score and I got in. And I was like, &quot;What&#39;s wrong here?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, so I used to look forward to a university over there, a lot. Not anymore, but I understand now that any school is good if you really want to study something. It goes along with the dream part. I used to have a lot of dreams, which here in Mexico, it was just like ... I didn&#39;t find, or I haven&#39;t found what I want, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started a psychology career in Quer&eacute;taro. I was there for two months, and then I had another problem with my dad, and he was going to help me with that. Half and half, where I was working and I was paying my school, and he used to help me a little bit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then we, again, had a problem and just can&#39;t along together, even though we try, or even though I try most of the times, because again, he&#39;s a bus driver. So, he thinks that I have to be for him whenever he wants, because he&#39;s a bus driver.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, I studied psychology. I decided to start that career, because they&#39;ve tried to get me to a psychologist like three times in my life. The first time, the psychologist here in Mexico was at a DIF, and that didn&#39;t work out. I just left. He said something and I just flipped, and I just left the room.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And yeah, the second time they tried that, that didn&#39;t go well. That didn&#39;t go well at all. It was another man. The two first ones were mans. And, well, I gave it a shot when I was 24, 23. I gave it a shot again because it was a woman, and she was a psychologist, so I was looking forward to it. Maybe it was different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But then, I just noticed that ... I don&#39;t know if people here in Mexico just study because they want a paper, or they just study because ... I don&#39;t know. They don&#39;t have it inside of them. They just want the paper and a job. They don&#39;t really want something worth their time. So, she was just not intellectual enough, if I can put it that way, to help me. And she just couldn&#39;t help me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that didn&#39;t work. And then a week later, I decided to study psychology on my own, because I was like, &quot;Then I have to help myself.&quot; I just got to that point. And even though it&#39;s not one of my dreams, but just decided to study something. </span><span>But y</span><span class="c0">eah. Was looking forward to it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My teacher said that I was looking forward to being a organizational psychologist, something like that. I don&#39;t really know if that&#39;s even a career, but that&#39;s something. Or I don&#39;t know, that&#39;s a title. I don&#39;t really know. But he said that, so I was like, &quot;Okay, let me study first and then I&#39;ll get to that point.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And, well, when I had a problem with my dad, I was just like, &quot;No. I&#39;m not studying until I have something worthwhile, or something that really takes mentally, spiritually ... something that I really, that I want.&quot; But then again, it goes back to my dreams. I used to have a lot of dreams, so had to cross out a lot, because it was so ... I don&#39;t want to use the word &quot;difficult,&quot; but I can&#39;t find another word.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was pretty difficult trying to study something here in Mexico. I have a career in computers and all that, graphic design and operating microcomputers and stuff like that. And that&#39;s one of those schools here in Mexico that&#39;s just a side career. It&#39;s not like a university, or it&#39;s not like a high school. It&#39;s just a &quot;t&eacute;cnica,&quot; they call it here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right, technical.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Technical career. And yeah, my grandparents were like, &quot;You have to study something, so just study this.&quot; And then one day, it was like, this guy with a promotion and you can get a ... una beca [scholarship]. What is it in the States, when they pay your school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scholarship?</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c5">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A scholarship, there you go. Sorry. So, they gave me a scholarship to study that school. I think it was at half off first, and yeah, if I had good grades, it would be like that always, and it stayed like that the three years. And at the same time, I was studying high school, so had to drop out, because I was ... There&#39;s this school, </span><span>Bachilleres Cinco</span><span class="c0">. It&#39;s one of the highest schools here for high schools, public.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there, all my family from my dad&#39;s side studied there, so an uncle, an auntie, two other cousins and three girl cousins. And I had to be part of the family, so I had to study there too. So, I dropped out because my dad was kicked out. And I just left. I was there a year and a half, and then just had to work, basically. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you&#39;re still young.</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, still young.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know that you think that it&#39;s been a lot of years of struggle, but you&#39;re still young. So hopefully, some of those dreams that haven&#39;t been crossed off ...</span></p><p class="c1"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you very much for talking to me.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.30j0zll"><span>David</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c16" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c5 c9"></span></p><div><p class="c16 c18"><span class="c9 c5"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c11" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c0"></span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c10"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c14"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
