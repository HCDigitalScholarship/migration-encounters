c3"></span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So this is Anne and I&#39;m doing an interview with Ian and his migration </span><span class="c2">encounters </span><span class="c0">ID is, Dali D-A-L-I. And I just wanted to start by thanking you for talking with us. I know that you&#39;re going to tell your story and it could be painful. And so I just want to thank you for sharing that with us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, no problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I wasn&#39;t involved in your survey, so you might just tell me, what were the circumstances behind your migrating to the U.S. like what were the motivations, how old you were, that sort of thing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was very young, so we might&#39;ve migrated twice. The first time when, when I was probably about one, then came back here, did a bit of some schooling, then went back before our visa expired. So we stayed over there and that was pretty much it. And those years accumulated probably add up to 13 years that I was, that I stayed over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you... the second time you went to the States, how old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The second time? I was around nine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nine, yeah. Nine or 10. Yeah, probably.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when you were... so you went at one and you stayed for how many years before you came back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably until first grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you spent a few years going to school here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you went back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So obviously it was your parents making these decisions.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what their motivation was?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the first time, I believe it was because my grandma got really sick and maybe some other problems that they have. I have not been around to discuss. Then we went back. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your grandma, you came back to Mexico because your grandma was sick?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your parents think that, did they think they&#39;re going to the U.S. would be better economically for all of you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I honestly did not know what the thought was.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were thinking, yeah?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I just knew that it was... well from what I remember. I mean we remember everything that... I think they... somewhere I heard that you&#39;re, bound to remember more what happened when you were younger, then as you get older. So the second time that we went back, I just remembered like feeling, not even just witnessing, but feeling the... maybe the lack of love between my parents. So I honestly did not know what the reasons were. It could have been just really a combination of everything. Maybe even economical. I don&#39;t know a lot of things, but I like to think that maybe it was because of me. But yeah, I mean there&#39;s a lot of factors I probably haven&#39;t looked into.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were there... did you have siblings or were you just the only child?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m actually the only child. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you went over the first time before you came back, did you learn English or not until...?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you did? So how did you learn?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember telling ...Luisa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Luisa, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;...that I kept learning as I went, but honestly it was like second nature. Honestly did not remember how, like it just kept...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You go to the playground or you just... kids... and you just...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that was, that was good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came back to Mexico that first time, did you miss the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first time? Yeah. Yeah. It was strange, but it actually... I think it was the first time I ever felt nostalgia, even then, like so young. I just remember actually, it was just me and my cousin who came alone in a plane. We came back here in a plane alone. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And my mom was going to, my parents were going to meet us later, but that was like even a couple of months after. But yeah, that&#39;s where the feeling grew. And I don&#39;t know why I felt, it felt beautiful then, but I think the second time... things started to really just go downhill.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you went back the second time and you started school, you said you were nine about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, around nine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were, what, fourth grade?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, around fourth grade.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you knew English by then, so...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I might&#39;ve even forgotten a little bit because I got placed into ESL.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you got placed in ESL.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I got placed into ESL. They made me stay there for like, maybe a couple months until they felt that I was doing better.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That sounds like a no to me, but whatever.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I could have liked it, honestly. I think I have potential to even</span><span class="c2">, you know, </span><span class="c2 c3">kick it up a notch, but there&#39;s just so many things, like, I don&#39;t know, the teacher. If I get... </span><span class="c2">I </span><span class="c0">had potential, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there a... did you see a big difference between schooling in the U S and schooling in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Mostly privilege. It was definitely safer and it was more a range than over here. Yeah, when I came here the first time I actually opened up my chin because they weren&#39;t really supervising us. If that&#39;s how you say it, they weren&#39;t really taking care of us. And somehow, I opened my chin and...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, bloody.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Pretty bloody yeah?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. What city were you in? Were you in the same city the two times that you went to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which city?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do I have to?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t want to say. Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s fine. That&#39;s fine. So, when you were in the U.S. you said they sort of took care of you a little better in school, kept an eye on you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you do extracurriculars like sports or music or art or anything like that? Do you remember that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As a youngster, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. That was at, I think until like next year. The next year.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And then you did?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One year later</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Started with soccer and just little sports. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it fun?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not actually, no. I mean, I wanted to like it honestly, I actually did like it, but I remember my dad would attend and he would be kind of like... it would just be kind of disappointed in me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, so I was like, aw, man. That&#39;s like the only part that I didn&#39;t like, because I knew that his disappointment... he did not hide it. So I was like, aw, man, no. But I get it. I get it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you lived with your mom and dad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you guys... do your parents work? Both of them?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So was there, when you came home from school, was someone there for you or were you sort of... </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, somebody had to pick me up and then they went to, they dropped me off and then they went back to work.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you were alone a lot?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Pretty alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well that must&#39;ve been tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it was difficult. Yeah. I remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you graduate from high school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I actually like kicked it up a little bit more and then I got a full ride scholarship.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To college.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What college? But you don&#39;t have to tell if you don&#39;t want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I could say. It was University of Nebraska at Omaha.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you graduate from college?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I did not. That was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, It was my fault.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like college when you went?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually did. I liked some of it, but I&#39;m not too fond of rules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know, I felt like everybody was.... looking... I don&#39;t know, I feel a lot of pressure. It just like, I don&#39;t know. I got to the point where it was really tiring because from a young age, I always felt pressure. So feeling that even until right now, it made me feel kind of anxious. But I liked school. I wanted to focus more on... art.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">Yeah, p</span><span class="c0">hilosophy, things like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I actually took it... had the chance to. But yet things from outside just got involved into the mix and yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long have you been back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two years. Two years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So in high school, did you said you got a full scholarship, so did you get in trouble in high school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I actually did.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In trouble with law or just trouble in... like being a trouble maker?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. At school, I think I was really respectful to everybody. I think it mostly came from outside. I started doing graffiti.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can get in trouble for that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah yeah yeah. I actually did. And then there was times where I got in trouble, even because I did not want to get in trouble. I mean, just at night, maybe skating around and just being profiled, like oh, you know, he did this and that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And did you have your papers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You never had papers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I never had...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you got through high school and you got a full scholarship at the college and they were okay with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they were actually really okay with it and I was surprised.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever get a license?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever drive?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I shouldn&#39;t of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I know. It&#39;s hard not to, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Seeing everybody drive...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So art is something you liked.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even till then, I love it. That&#39;s something that I think if, if somebody ever left me that I depended on or even didn&#39;t depend on, I think that was, that&#39;s the only thing that ever... that does not leave. Or that or music, that&#39;s something that I think has been brewing since I was small. Just depending on that. Yeah. Actually have my sketchbook that I was showing to Luisa. It&#39;s, really just like</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;O, can I see?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... it&#39;s not the best... It&#39;s like, there&#39;s so many paintings that I have at home I need to finish. I was finishing. Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow. That&#39;s great. So it&#39;s a pen and ink?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And some markers.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Markers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like watercolor markers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They look, but yeah. I honestly don&#39;t know the... I think they&#39;re alcohol based.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Those are great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here&#39;s just like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I used to do graffiti, so it was...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s harder when it&#39;s big though, right? No?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s kind of fun.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure </span><span class="c2">it&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;fun. Yeah. Look at this. This is great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I remember doing this precisely in philosophy class. I don&#39;t really like rules. You know? Yeah, so I was, I just doodled that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beautiful. Yeah. I have a daughter who is also she&#39;s, well, she&#39;s studying architecture, but she does all this kind of, I mean, not like you, but different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Really?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But she draws. She does a lot of very abstract looking things too, but much less angular, more with colors.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually want to study architecture here. I love it. That&#39;s so cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s okay. I mean, what&#39;s in here,</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you have paintings at home.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Just like a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that one? The colors. It was like a light blue?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m sorry. This one?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That one&#39;s actually my cousin. So that also did not help, being around him.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. We would get in trouble, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you think that... is that why you, while you&#39;re back here? You got in trouble?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you want to tell me what it was about or not?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s great. That&rsquo;s beautiful. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I actually made that a little bit more. These are like sketches that I helped put into my paintings like this, something with a baby, like a fetus. I don&#39;t know, just...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&rsquo;s beautiful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re like, this is all really....</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that someone, you know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was supposed to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just don&#39;t know what else to. Yeah. I make music. I rap about things...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh you&#39;re a rapper?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah kind of. I know that has a lot of negative connotations, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not in the U.S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah. But yeah, I actually stopped by a studio this past Saturday. The first time ever here. I felt right at home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But yeah, there&#39;s, there&#39;s a lot of things that I could show you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But, but back to that, I mean, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got in trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I got in trouble.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With the law.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. With the law.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it bad?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go to jail?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I went to jail.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For how long?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not long. Maybe like a week before. I would have been sent for like maybe even more. I honestly don&#39;t know. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then ICE came to get you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. When I was in jail, I thought... well, that&#39;s what they said. I mean, that&#39;s where... I don&#39;t get it. Supposedly they&#39;re not supposed to interfere inside of the jail, but </span><span class="c2">they</span><span class="c2 c3">&nbsp;did anyways. And while they told me like &quot;you&#39;re fucked&quot;. Like, like after this, we&#39;re going to take you either way. And it&#39;s crazy. We&#39;re supposed to pay bail for that. For jail, for the </span><span class="c2">c</span><span class="c0">ounty jail, then get detained by them and then pay another bail for them. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think the situation got really bad. I think before I came here, things were really dark. Yeah. Really, really dark.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dark for you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah and for everybody else around me. I think I was becoming a really toxic person and just not really helping me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re you depressed? Were you...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was, it was bad. I think just everything from the government, from politics to lik</span><span class="c2">e</span><span class="c0">... I think a lot was affecting me that I couldn&#39;t process at once. That I think it just made me act up. Even then, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t like thinking about it because I get this feeling right here. It&#39;s like, oh, like how? It&#39;s hard. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you got very dark and sort of rebelled and</span><span class="c2">&hellip; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Even then, I like, I still rebel, but not, not as much as like I got to the point of hurting people, like emotionally and just seeing that develop... I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do your parents try to help out or keep you in the States? Or?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dad wasn&#39;t with us anymore. He actually left.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that must&#39;ve been tough too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there was like a lot of things...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That just building up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That I had to like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Process</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Even then I didn&#39;t. You kno</span><span class="c2">w?</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;It just like kept inside and I had to help my mom out and whatever I could. But I, I didn&#39;t. I felt like I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s still there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she&#39;s with me now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came back with you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you back at school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I actually wanted to get involved in school through my work. But I didn&rsquo;t. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your work?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You don&#39;t have an accent at all. You sound like you&#39;re </span><span class="c2">an</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;American. Do you know that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What are you feeling? What do you feel like you are?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;American? Mexi</span><span class="c2">can?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t like to think so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&#39;s also like something that makes me feel kind of bad. Not knowing where I belong. yeah. It&#39;s crazy. I don&#39;t know. This life is really... really crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">It&#39;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah it&#39;s so crazy. Like, I don&#39;t know. Just a lot of things make me think that it&#39;s not even real.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Has it been tough coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, I had to leave some people behind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did you leave behind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just some friends. And opportunities.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because you had to drop out of school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Opportunities, friendships, possibly even job opportunities. I don&#39;t know. But I mean, we make the best that we can. We have to, we really have to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, you&#39;re really, really talented and you&#39;re really, really smart. So do you think of going back to college here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most likely. Like I said, when you mentioned architecture, that&#39;s something that I want to do. I want to continue doing that. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you said, how old are you? 20?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;21.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got your whole life ahead of you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I hope so.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I mean, I&#39;m glad that things happen the way they did, even the negative parts, I feel like everything is just... it all aligned with the time. Everything happened like right on time. I don&#39;t know why, it just did. It felt like it did and I&#39;m taking advantage of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know you&#39;re really young and you&#39;ve had a lot of turmoil. What are your dreams right now? I mean, you said you would like maybe architecture. Do you have any big dreams?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not that I can think of. I mean, periodically, I have things that I want to do, but not at the moment... no. Sadly, no. Unfortunately, I still have that trail of worrying about things that I need to do that makes me think twice about dreams. It makes me think twice if I can do that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you mean that you&#39;re just sort of looking back at the bad things you did that makes you worried about whether you deserve to dream? Is that what you&#39;re telling me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Maybe I have to really look out for my family and things like that, that make me... That I&#39;ll have to sacrifice my dreams just to... be in good stance with them. I think that&#39;s that pressure once again. Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And when you say your family, it&#39;s your mom?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Mostly. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Its&#39; your mom</span><span class="c2">.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you supporting her now? You&#39;re at T-Tech, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;m going to be honest in saying that I&#39;m not.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Mostly for the same reasons I got... there&#39;s a lot of contradictions, mostly with me and her that, that I don&#39;t really know what to do... if I should stay at work? I thought I was doing something good. You know? Things like that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Disagreements. You guys aren&#39;t on the same page?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think I&#39;m doing something good, but... and then I get it, she has a right to tell me, or to let me know. And...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did she want you to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She wants me to go back to school and I told her that, &quot;Yeah, I want to go back too,&quot; but there&#39;re some things that take time, but I do want to go back to school.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah it&rsquo;s tough. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you been in trouble here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, that came here and I was like, I&#39;m going to try my best, not to get involved with anybody that I don&#39;t have to, like I did back back then. You know? So I think I&#39;m doing pretty good. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&rsquo;s good. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Just keeping to myself, having to do what I have to do and not needing to do it unnecessary... </span><span class="c2">I</span><span class="c0">t&#39;s not worth it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you&#39;re trying to follow rules... a few at least.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. I mean, they&#39;re kind of arbitrary. I mean, well if they do not make sense. If they make sense and everybody can coexist and... just normal rules, like </span><span class="c2">yeah,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I can follow. But if it&#39;s something that, I don&#39;t know, that you have to do. I don&#39;t know... I&#39;m not... I don&#39;t think I&#39;m...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c2">You&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;good at that. I understand. I understand. Arbitrary rules.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I don&#39;t know. I forget, but there&#39;s some rules that are like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So are you resentful that you get deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Towards?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, I kind of got myself there in the first place, so I don&#39;t think I should be. No, not at all. I mean, it was my fault. So, yeah...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was in... what you did was not related to you being undocumented, or you being?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at all. It was just like a mixture of things, of rebellion, of desperation. And I guess being able to feel something. Yeah. Just like all of those. Strange.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, I think those are all my questions. Anything you want to say before we end?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was kind of skeptical of coming here. I just did not know what to expect. I didn&#39;t even know this was here and it was actually kind of cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a cool place. You should get... Luisa</span><span class="c2">&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a great woman. They&#39;re doing good stuff. Might be worth exploring.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ian:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah of course. Yeah, I&#39;ll definitely come here again. I don&#39;t think this was the first or last time... yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c3">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good. That&rsquo;s good, that&rsquo;s good.
