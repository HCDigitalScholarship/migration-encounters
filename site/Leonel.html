This is Claudia and your name was?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonel.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Leonel. Cool. So yeah. Thank you so much. First of all, I wanted to thank you so much for coming and talking to us. I understand that sometimes speaking about these stories can be kind of difficult and can bring about certain emotions that you don&#39;t want to feel. But I think it&#39;s good to know that your stories are important and it&#39;s important for people to hear it and people to understand the realities of migration and the human side of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think you&#39;ll find that it will be a cathartic experience in a way. So, yeah. That&#39;s pretty much it. Thank you so much. I guess now let&#39;s get started.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thanks to you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My first question for you is why did your family decide to leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, basically, because my mom wanted to, well, have a better job. My mom here was a maid. She wanted to grew economically, so that&#39;s the main reason why we moved there. So, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you moved with both of your parents and your siblings or just your mom?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, I don&#39;t know my dad, so I&#39;ve just lived with my mom. So yeah, she&#39;s the one that makes the decisions of everything when I was a little kid. So yeah, she took us there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I remember some things, not all of them, but I do remember the desert. That was pretty memorable. Well, the first thing that I do remember is that, well we weren&rsquo;t&mdash;the spaces were pretty different like from here. The first house that we were there was pretty big instead of&hellip;in comparison to the other house that we were staying here in Mexico. But honestly, I cannot tell you with details because I was too little, so I don&#39;t remember very much.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you do? Did you go to school and stuff?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I went to school. I went to elementary, to junior high and to high school, I went there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember any teachers or any friends?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, yeah, definitely. Well, in ____, there&#39;s a big Hispanic community. So I remember that I made a lot of Spanish speaking friends. So that helped me out a lot to, I guess, not feel as a foreign. I don&#39;t know how to say it because with the folks here in my work while sharing some of the experiences, they sometimes say that it feels pretty harsh to be Spanish speaker in a place where nobody speaks Spanish. But in the case of Tucson_____, there&#39;s a lot of Spanish speaking communities. So, that helped me out a lot to, well, feel at home always.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your life like? What have you been up to?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was cool. My life was cool. Well, it&#39;s still cool. But well, what I used to do is I was a bartender the last couple of years that I was there, so I was pretty much... I was really happy. I was working and I had a really decent job. I just had moved with my girlfriend at that time, so I was on this process of being independent and being stable and well maybe creating... I was on that step of maybe having a new family, right? But yeah, that&#39;s how was my life there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your favorite drink to make as a bartender?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Laughter]. Well, I had a lot of those, but I liked the Old Fashioned.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s a drink, an Old Fashioned. It&#39;s with bourbon and sugar and spices. That&#39;s how it is, and it&#39;s pretty tasty. I love it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that job? Did you meet a lot of people?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I met a lot of people every night. Well, I like it a lot because I am a really social person. I talk a lot and I like to talk with people a lot, so, well, I really enjoyed that work. I would just talk and make the drinks and have fun. That was all the job. [Chuckles] It was cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you graduated high school and then what did you... Is that when you started bartending or what did you do afterwards?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was in high school, I started working on construction because I was still living with my mom and I wanted to help her out a little bit. I actually wanted to be on college there, but you need... Well, I mean, you can actually study the college, but you need... To graduate, you need your social security number. So, I mean, it&#39;s basically useless to study college there. So that&#39;s when I decided to work or look for a job that I would like better than construction work. So, no. That&#39;s when I just decided to drop school. I mean, I finished school and then I just decided to go work.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk me through how you ended up back in Mexico. How were you deported? What happened?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I usually was careful with the police because of my situation as a migrant, as a non-official citizen of the US, so I was always careful on regards of that. But, well, at that time, I guess it was the day of not being careful. So, yeah. What happened is that basically, I was driving with some of my friends, and my friend didn&#39;t got a license here and he also got deported because he&#39;s also Mexican, too. Well, that unfortunate night, we got caught by the police and we were also drinking and we also had some drugs on us. Well yeah, I guess, I mean, which kid doesn&#39;t get detained for that, right? But in our case, we weren&#39;t official citizens. So, that&#39;s why we got deported basically. That&#39;s the main reason. Right? We didn&#39;t do anything out of that scheme. We just had drugs on us. That&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you are in detention for a month you&#39;re saying. How was that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was terrible. I mean, I don&#39;t want to make the story too long, but it&#39;s just like... Well, it&#39;s just white supremacy. You know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk about it. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Chuckles]. Well, police there say that they follow the rules, but ultimately </span><span class="c4">they follow the racist rules</span><sup><a href="#cmnt1" id="cmnt_ref1">[a]</a></sup><span class="c0">. Like yeah you can&hellip;they tell you your rights for whatever, but there&#39;s always, well there&rsquo;s always mistreatment for people that are colored skin. It doesn&#39;t matter if you&#39;re black or brown, right? But well, with us, especially with Mexicans or Latinos in general, well they do have some hate for us in particular. Right? So not only with the guards themselves, but with the prisoners, too. Like the experience is not good at all because there&#39;s discrimination in&hellip;everywhere. You know? So, it&#39;s pretty tough to stand that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I remember that I just wanted to get out of there. I just wanted to come here to Mexico, because I knew that I wasn&#39;t going to stay there. That wasn&#39;t an option anymore. So what I just told to the lawyer was to make it as fast as possible to just deport me right away. But it was just, I don&#39;t know, it was continuous discrimination and offensive and whatever&hellip;just bullshit. Basically, it was every day, someone reminding you like, fucking wetback or fucking whatever. That&#39;s how it goes there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was the return back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, on the border, it was pretty rough because I was pretty unfamiliar with everything. I didn&#39;t know anyone there, so it was pretty tough. Fortunately, my mom sent me some money so I could catch a bus to here. I stayed in Nogales for like two days, and then I just took a bus and came here. Here, I met my uncle and he&#39;s the one that told me, &quot;Hey, I have this friend that has this apartment in rent, so you can stay there meanwhile, while you get a job or something, and then you can start renting in.&quot; So it was pretty sweet when I came here. I just felt much better than being there on the fucking prison. So it was better than staying.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c4">Yeah, for sure. The whole thing with your mom and your sister still being in the States, like the difficulties of family separation, how was that?</span><sup><a href="#cmnt2" id="cmnt_ref2">[b]</a></sup></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well, I was pretty depressed on the first month because I mean, I still miss them a lot. But, well, well first of all, in the case of my sister, she has the actual opportunity. Now, she&#39;s looking for&hellip;for having money to actually come here and visit me someday. I don&#39;t know if it&#39;s going to be soon or when, but it&#39;s going to happen. Well, that&#39;s on regards of my sister, but in the case of my mom, that really, that hurts a lot because I don&#39;t know when I&#39;m going to see her. I can only talk to her and well watch her in videos, and phone talks and all that kind of stuff. But, yeah, I do miss her a lot. I mean, I feel good for myself because I know she&#39;s proud of me because I&#39;m at least taking care of myself, but I mean I miss her a lot. I don&#39;t know what to tell you. I just miss her, and that&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s been the hardest part of being back here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, um, the money, first of all, because you get used to one lifestyle and definitely it&#39;s a much better lifestyle in regards of how much you earn, how much you can do with that earning on the States. Here, you earn much less and you got to work much more. I mean, there, I worked five hours per day, six hours. Here, I need to work nine hours at least, and I get like half of the payment that I used to get there. And well, it really kicks your ass to working, especially because here it&#39;s ironic, you know, because... I want this to be recorded because it&#39;s ironic how US companies use a cheap working force that we are because it&#39;s cheap, because you don&#39;t need to train us in regards of speaking English. We already know English and we know it pretty well.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, but the thing here is that you pay us with the laws of a third-world country as Mexico. So you don&#39;t need to pay us as if we were working on the US, as you pay the employees that you have there on the US. And so, I don&#39;t know, it&#39;s ironic because we&#39;re getting deported to work for the same people, to still work for the US. Instead of at least, be working for our country, we work for the US. So yeah, and well the payment is not that good. Right? I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s just-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re working for the same companies&hellip;?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We&#39;re working for the companies, which have the... I mean, it&#39;s a country that kicks us out, but still exploits us, you know. So we don&#39;t have the right to be a citizen, despite we have worked there and despite we have given them our money with our work, and now we still need to pay them some way or another. Well, that&#39;s&hellip;that&rsquo;s fucked up.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s very fucked up. Here, in Mexico, have you received any assistance from the government or any organization?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Well, also, because I haven&#39;t looked for it. I think that if I look for it, then maybe I would be having some benefits, but I think it&#39;s most out of pride that I don&#39;t look for any of that. So, no, I haven&#39;t gotten any benefits.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. Mexican, definitely. I consider that US is Mexico. So no matter what they say.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk a little bit more about that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, I think that, well, the only thing that makes at least that part where I was living in... Well, almost half of what is right now the US, the US is just a paper. But in terms of the people that actually live there, the identity, the history of that land, that land is Mexican. That land is not white. That land is brown. I mean, the people that live there since 500 years ago were indigenous people, the same people that have lived here in Mexico always. It&#39;s not white people, it&#39;s brown people. Well, I am brown, so that&#39;s my identity. So I do think that the only ones that are actually migrant people are the white people.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I completely agree with you. Yeah. If you could&#39;ve stayed in the United States, what do you think you might have done?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In regards of work or...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Life in general.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was on my way or I was planning to build a family with my ex-girlfriend, the one that I was dating there. We were already living together and we were planning to make a family, to have a kid or something like that. That was the plan.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So now that you&#39;re here, what do you think you&#39;d like to do? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do want to study something. I don&#39;t know yet if... Well, first, I need to seek for a way to revalidate my studies or see if they actually count, and if yes, then look for a way to go to university here, because I do know that university here is free. That&#39;s how it should be there, too. But I do want to study something that has to do with all of this like, I don&#39;t know, sociology or something like that. So something that has to do with that. That&#39;s what I want to...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome. I&#39;m </span><span>also studying history. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, really?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s cool. Where do you study? At UNAM?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I study in Philly. I&#39;m from Puerto Rico.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I went to the States two years ago to study.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. So Borricua.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Laughter]. Yeah. I&#39;m a little curious. In your survey, you mentioned that you did face some bureaucratic challenges and also some stuff with the police. Can you just talk to me a little bit more about that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, yeah. Well I haven&rsquo;t&mdash;I &#39;ve never been someone that stays quiet when something seems to be wrong for me. So, the police, not only on the US but everywhere, they have a problem with that kind of people, too. So, well yeah, that&#39;s the main issue with me. I never stay quiet when I think that something is wrong. So, yeah, I always point the things that I see that are wrong, like, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re doing this wrong. And I don&#39;t think that is fair.&quot; Right? Well, I not only did that with the police, but also with teachers or with authority figures in general, which didn&#39;t like that too much, especially because of my condition as a migrant. I do think that&#39;s the main reason why they didn&#39;t like that. But well, with police, I always had that trouble of speaking out. [Chuckles]. I don&#39;t know. Something specific like...Well, like they used to detain me or whatever, but they never caught me with anything. But it was like a pattern, you know, every time. That&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. We&#39;re nearing the last few questions. These are a little bit more reflective. They don&#39;t necessarily have to do maybe with you, but more in general, but you can also speak about your experiences.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alright.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well, they can do plenty of stuff. Um, first of all, and I think that the main target that they need to address is the young migrants, because we are the ones that get more affected by this. Well, first of all, because I think we are&hellip;we&rsquo;re much more easily to get caught in the violence that is already going on in this country in terms of the criminal organizations. Why? Because, well, it&#39;s not really easy to find a job. Like I mean, it is easy, but you do need to look for it. There&#39;s not an open door for you like, &quot;Hey, this is the options for you that you have here.&quot; No, you have to look for those options. And well, I mean, not all the young people get deported in the same conditions.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What I mean by that is that mentally and emotionally, well with the deporting and with all... Well, who knows what else do you have back there? So if you have some issues or whatever, it&#39;s not easy to find a job, you know, especially when you&#39;re in somewhere that you haven&#39;t been in years, right? So well, what I think that the Mexican government should do is open more opportunities for working for the young people, for the young migrants, too, that are coming back because they are just as... I mean, they are potential criminal for the organizations, for all the cartels, and all the shit that&#39;s going on here. They are potential criminals for them. They are just like new hires. You know? They don&#39;t have anything to lose for say like that. So, that&#39;s what I think they need to do the most in that case.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, a lot of support in terms of emotionally and... Yeah. Well, I mean, people come here depressed, and that means also a lot of substance abuse, you know. Like here in my job, there&#39;s a lot of substance abuse because... Well, in my case, at least, I have some relatives here in the city, too, but there are other folks that they don&#39;t have anyone here on the city, but on the States or pretty far away. And I mean, that&#39;s isolating, and that creates depression, and that creates substance abuse. It&#39;s not that we are already criminals or whatever, because sometimes people used to say, &quot;Oh, well, yeah, you were there in a gang. So you come here and try to do the same gang shit.&quot; But no! Well, I mean, yeah, you know that life. You come here and you don&#39;t have anything, what do you expect to do? Well, same shit, man.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. Sometimes people try to look at it as if it was really easy or as if it was a formula of one plus one is two, but it&#39;s not like that, you know. It&#39;s much more harder and much more complex than that. That&#39;s what I would think they should do, the job opportunities and emotional support and that and psychological support for all the young people that come here without anything. That&#39;s my main suggestion.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that young Mexican men in the United States turn to crime and gangs, and also, I guess, here too. But I know that that&#39;s also a problem that comes from there and gets back here. </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think that there are several reasons. Well, the main thing here is that despite being there on a let&#39;s call it first-world country or whatever, we still live under a system that creates injustice and creates a lack of opportunities, no matter if you live in Germany or in the US or in Mexico or El Salvador or whatever. I mean, every country in its own level, but there&#39;s always lack of opportunities, there&#39;s always inequalities, there&#39;s always that thing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t want to sound like, &quot;Oh, well, this is the reason why,&quot; you know. I think that the main cause of these things is first of all, poverty, lack of opportunities and lack of education. I don&#39;t mean going to school, but personal education like values, like personal values or spiritual education. That&#39;s what I think. Well, in this society, it&#39;s all about the more you have in terms of material things is the more you are. That&rsquo;s why, well, I think that&#39;s the main reason why gangs exist because in the gangs, such as in the real society, the more you have is the more you are. So it&#39;s just like in a smaller scale. I think that&#39;s the main reason.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c4">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the United States governme</span><span>n</span><span class="c4">t do to help Mexican deportees and their families</span><span>&nbsp;that they leave behind?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, maybe get back to Europe maybe. Maybe that&#39;s the first step that they should take, to, well, start on building or rebuilding this big thing that we call United States, right? Because, well, I think that first of all, the United States is a country that has a really hypocrite way to stand and tell their own history because, well they&rsquo;re&hellip;it&#39;s a country that has a history based on genocide. So I think that&#39;s the very first step that the US country needs to acknowledge, just for it to acknowledge what&#39;s going wrong with that, because I think that&#39;s the main reason why&hellip;why there&#39;s been so many problems with that society. Because we cannot just to try to&hellip;try to patch a big scar, a scar that is so deep and so long, and that has been like that&hellip;has been going on like that for years and years and years, and we&#39;re still going that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If we don&#39;t acknowledge first that... Well, there&#39;s no United States, there was a genocide. And after the genocide, after the people that originally lived there and, well yeah, existed there were killed in mass was when this country started. After we acknowledged that, that&#39;s when we&#39;re going to start making the real changes. Other than that, there&#39;s no policy that is going to help for it. We need to get off our own masks. And because, it&#39;s something that nobody wants to listen to, and not even us Mexicans or Latinos or whatever. When you say that, nobody wants to listen to it or to even touch that part of the history. But personally, that&#39;s what I think that it needs to be said and to be acknowledged for we to change. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Fantastic. I agree 100% with everything that you said, honestly. I guess in speaking of discrimination as returning migrants, why do you think that people in Mexico have such a negative perception of returning migrants?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I think it depends, right? Because in case of the police here, then yeah, they do have a pretty bad... I don&#39;t know how to say it. A pretty bad view for migrants. But for people in general, I haven&#39;t got that view of being discriminated. Well, I do think that one thing that has to do with that is that I never was part of a gang or anything like that. I don&#39;t have any tattoos or that kind of stuff. So maybe that has a big thing to do with that, but I haven&#39;t been discriminated that badly except for police. So, I don&#39;t have much to say about that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Okay. Yeah. Those were all the questions that I had. Now I just want to give you the space to add anything or to say anything else that you may want to. Anything. Anything at all?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I do need to say that...Well, first of all, if my mom gets to listen to this, I love you with all my heart, mom, and I miss you so much every day. I&#39;m thinking about you every second. And just for you to know that mom. And second, well, just that we need to acknowledge that&hellip;we need to acknowledge our history in order for us to change. If we don&rsquo;t&hellip;People that don&#39;t know their history are people that are doomed to repeat their own history. That&#39;s for all of us, brown, black, and white. That&#39;s all.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you satisfied with everything that you&#39;ve told me?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Leonel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right.
