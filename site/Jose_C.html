c17">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so this is Anne and I&#39;m interviewing </span><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and I just want to thank you for coming to talk to us. For many people, it&#39;s painful stories that they tell us. So, if it is painful for you, I&#39;m sorry that you&#39;ve been living it but hopefully it won&#39;t be too bad.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, so this is your interview. I think it&#39;s best for you to start by talking about the circumstances around which you initially went to the U.S., who went with you, how&#39;d you get there, what your first impressions were, how old you were, stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why you went.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, well. For starters, thank you for listening to me. The main reason why we went is, according to my mom, it was to have a better life. Have some experience on knowing different ways of living, different languages, stuff like this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We did, to arrive to the U.S. when I was about 10 years old and we did arrive to the U.S. illegally. I remember that up to a certain point on the road, we had to split from my sister. She was, if I remember properly, she was somewhere around about six to seven years old. She was barely starting in elementary and I remember that I had to walk with my mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During the beginning of the walk, I remember that we were a considerable... We were about seven or eight in the group and barely starting. We got mugged by, I don&#39;t know how you may call it, but these people just came out of nowhere and everything that we had, we had it removed from us.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From there, we pretty much had to keep on walking, we walked about a day and a half because I remember that we started let&#39;s say a Friday and we arrived to the U.S. somewhere around Monday morning. So, we had to walk a considerable amount of time. I do remember that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that at the beginning when I started, I hated everything. I do remember that. I remember that for example food tasted funny. I remember that for example, the language since I couldn&#39;t understand anything at the beginning, it was really frustrating because I wanted to say something and no one would understand it and yeah, it was kind of complicated.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, I do remember this one time that when I was barely catching up to the language, we were living on a house&mdash;we were renting a room in a house and these kids, they used to always bother my sister. So, I took to defend her as much as I could. And obviously there was some discrimination regarding, like, offensive language and stuff like this. But obviously since I couldn&#39;t reply in English, I would normally say in Spanish. So, they would always say that they didn&#39;t understand until I started to get the language.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mainly started to learn the language because of the offensive words. Not because one would want to say them, but it&#39;s so that one would know when they&#39;re being cursed at. Yeah. (chuckle) It sounds funny now but-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little backwards but, yeah. Seriously. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. At least that&#39;s why I learned it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh-huh (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember that during, for example, I went to Tomahawk Elementary. This is in Phoenix. I do remember that at the beginning, for example, Hispanics, well, the worst racism that I pretty much can think of is when it comes from your own race. And I do remember that Hispanics, especially for example other Mexicans that were born there or other Mexicans that have lived there for a considerable amount of time, they were way, considerably more racist to me than any other Caucasian or African American or any other ethnicity that was in mind, which sucked. Because at the end of the day, I felt considerably alone there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember there was this one kid. He was my first friend there. He was like, &quot;Hey, did you just barely arrived?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; &quot;Do you speak English?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No.&quot; He was like, &quot;Hey, no worries. If you have any issues, let me know. I&#39;ll explain things to you.&quot; And I remember that for example my home teacher, she... You&#39;re kind of reminding me of her.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But my home teacher-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was good?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she was pretty good. My home teacher, I remember that, I was used to arriving early to the classroom and when I arrived she was there. And I remember she started to try to teach me English as much as she could so I could, like, get along and catch up and things like this. And I remember that she tried so hard at the beginning and I saw her frustrated and I was like, &quot;Damn.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it was understandable and well, that was my elementary.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you probably were only in elementary for a year or two?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in elementary for about a year. Just sixth grade, then I went to middle school. And middle school... Can I say the name of the schools?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t matter? Okay. For example, in middle school, I went to this one school, it&#39;s on ___ avenue and ____ School, it&#39;s called _____. And we were divided by academical teams and I remember that in mine, were people who were pretty struggling with the language and stuff like this, so we could catch up and things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s where the point of being discriminated by your own race comes because, for example, the other academical teams that didn&#39;t have language barriers, they would say that we were stupid because we didn&#39;t know the language or they would start discriminating because of this same fact. Letting us know that they were better than us in some dumb way.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember that, for example, sometimes coming back from middle school, I used to hate it so much that once I remember that I kicked everyone out of my room and I just closed the door and I started crying because I hated it so much, I didn&#39;t want to be there.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do remember that I blamed my mom so much because she took me to a place where I didn&#39;t want to be. She forced me to do something that I didn&#39;t want to do. And I do remember my mom regretting it or telling me that she was sorry and telling me that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t see it at the moment, but eventually I will start to see what she wanted for us to see or the reason of everything. And as I grew older, I started to notice the struggle that was here in this country economically, academically, stuff like this and things that I didn&#39;t see at the beginning. Things that I saw for granted, that I didn&#39;t pretty much wasn&#39;t aware of.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But even though this discrimination and stuff, obviously peer pressure comes along and yeah, I just started caring less about actually doing what you were there to do. Like for example in our case was to learn about the culture itself, the language. Have a different mind, open, and we just went along. At least the way that I see it now, it is the worst thing that you can do because you never learn anything. You just stay in some random cycle of self-destruction which I really don&#39;t... I don&#39;t know, I think back and I literally regret every single opportunity that I was offered. I literally do regret it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;During my middle school years, I mean, yeah, improved my English considerably. My academical status wasn&#39;t that bad I&#39;d like to think. But still the pressure of belonging to something that you&#39;re not used to or being somewhere that you&#39;re not used to still gets to you, right. So, I don&#39;t know, I guess I was a stupid kid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, did you join in with a gang or just kids that were not involved in school and didn&#39;t care or did any mischief?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, of course I did mischief but no, I never joined a gang. Never. I thought... I don&#39;t know if I was... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s weird but I&#39;ve always thought that that was, personally to me, that was something really stupid because... I&#39;ve always been taught and sadly but truly, at least the way that life has made me, is that you can be with your friends but at the moment when you have issues and you have troubles and there has to be a fight, you&#39;re on your own.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So being on a gang or having your little clique or things, sometimes that doesn&#39;t help you for anything because they will leave you alone. So, I&#39;ve always thought to stand up for me, for myself. It&#39;s a selfish way of thinking but at the end of day it did help me a lot. I didn&#39;t-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I would say that&hellip; Maybe you&#39;re not the exception but there&#39;s certainly a large number of young Mexicans who go as children and they feel somewhat alienated and then they join a gang because it becomes their family or some way of belonging and then they get in deep trouble, very deep trouble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I&#39;m not saying I didn&#39;t get in trouble.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure you got a little mischief.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. A little bit. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the gang culture is I guess, quite appealing to some so it&#39;s interesting that you managed to stay away from it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean&hellip; you see, the thing is... I&#39;m just going to say it like it is because I cannot think of a nicer way to say it. But the way that I&#39;ve normally thought about something in specific is what do I gain from it? Selfishly, honestly. But for example, the way that they come up to you on a gang because I was offered, is, &quot;Hey, you&#39;re Mexican right? You just arrived right?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah.&quot; Or like, &quot;All right, we&#39;re Mexican too bro. You&#39;re not alone.&quot; Stuff like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They start to get to you from that part because they know how it feels and then they start to get to you economically or anything. But honestly, I was about to fall into it until I asked the guy, &ldquo;what do I gain from it?&rdquo; He was like, &quot;What do you mean?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Big question.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m like, &quot;Yeah, what do I gain from it?&quot; &quot;Well, what do you mean? We&#39;re going to be like your family bro. It doesn&#39;t matter what happens, we will always stand up for you.&quot; &quot;Anything that I do, you guys will stand up for me. You can assure me that?&quot; &quot;Yes.&quot; &quot;What about economically? Even if I don&#39;t do anything would you guys still give me money?&quot; &quot;No, of course not. You have to work to get your money.&quot; &quot;Okay, but that&#39;s not family. My family even if I don&#39;t work and I have an issue, they will support me. Will you do the same thing?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s when he stayed quiet and I was like, &quot;Thank you, but no, thank you. I&#39;m good. I&#39;ll deal with my shit myself.&quot; Sorry for the foul language. But&hellip; </span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, was that hard? I understand that that was how you responded but did they let it go?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no they never do. Because the word &ldquo;no&rdquo; doesn&#39;t exist. It&#39;s either you do it, or you do it. And at the end of the day, they did try to find a way to retaliate. At the end of the day, that&#39;s when I mentioned that I had to find my&mdash;or deal with my things myself&mdash;without having to find anyone involved.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it got to a point... Yes, I did have mischief. I didn&#39;t join a gang, but the way I think about it, even if I wasn&#39;t on a gang, the way that I reacted to certain things, it wasn&#39;t the proper way. I could have just ignored them and let it go. And sometimes I just want to excuse the aggression or the retaliation that I had with the people who hurt me, with the fact that I was young and I was immature and I was ignorant to certain things.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But at the end of the day, I think we all know what we&#39;re doing. That they retaliate, yes, of course they do. They always find a way to get what they want when they want it and that&#39;s something that I didn&#39;t like. And that&#39;s something that yeah, it cost me. They chased me around, they beat me up, they did beat me up and things like that. Up to the point where I was just about to say yes and then I was like, no. No, why would I do that? Just because they&#39;re... Just so they can stop beating me? No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was bullied for my language, I was bullied for where I came from. I was discriminated and just to let someone do that to me which is my own race when it wasn&#39;t supposed to be that way, no. I wasn&#39;t going to let that happen. I mean, it did cost me a lot. It cost me money struggle, it cost me other difficulties but at least from the kids that I grew up with, I&#39;d like to say that I was capable of saying no.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did you finally make friends? Were there friends in high school that you feel like, you look back on and they were your friends? They had your back to some extent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, no.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you were alone.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Most of the time I was by myself and I was always alone. I mean, yes, I used to hang out with people for a little while but someone that I could actually call my friend that will be there whether if it was emotionally supportive or be there when I had a trouble or had an issue, someone that could actually care. No. No, I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And school wasn&#39;t great for you. You didn&#39;t grab on to anything like sports or art or...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Art. I draw.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You do?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I draw. I like drawing. I love drawing. I suck at it. I&#39;m a really good shader, I think I&#39;m amazing shader. Drawing is a little bit more difficult but I think I can manage. And languages. I love languages. I remember that when I got to high school, my first high school because we had to move, my first high school was Trevor Browne and there, there was... I remember that ever since we had the option in middle school to choose like an alternative, instead of classic art or sport or anything, I remember that I was fighting to get French.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love to learn different languages.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you feel that you could speak French now too?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;French. I do. Well, I had a considerable amount of French but, come on, I can-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You forget.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because I have no one here to practice. I mean, I can still for example introduce myself, say a couple of things. I can still do it but not the same as when I was learning it. Because I had no one to practice so I started to forget the language. And for example English, I still remember it because my sister speaks it, so we kind of managed it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think... So it seems like your mom took you to the States. Your dad was not in the picture?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think that was one of the issues that made it hard for you to-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To cope?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, during my teenage years, I do remember that, me saying to myself, I don&#39;t need my dad if he didn&#39;t want to stick around or be here for me. No, I didn&#39;t need him. It&#39;s because I didn&#39;t need him. No, but you do need him. You do need a fatherly figure to tell you, &quot;Dude, what you&#39;re doing is wrong. As a male, what you&#39;re doing is wrong.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone who can, like, tell you, &quot;Okay, yes I do understand what you&#39;re going through because I did this in my life and this and this and this. And this is how I did it.&quot; Because one thing is, when a mother tells you, you have to do this, this, and that, but if you&#39;re a male and you have a, obviously a mother or a female mother in this case, well, in this era, a female mother is not going to be the same way that they lived and what a guy lives.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I mean I do remember that my mom used to try to help me or what she could comprehend or try to deal with it, but there wasn&#39;t a specific way that she could because I understood that she wasn&#39;t the person that needed to tell me that. And that was an amazing factor for my almost going into a gang.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Almost what?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Falling into the gang because most commonly, what they try to offer you is that&hellip; that part that is missing. Someone who can walk you through, who can tell you what to do and what&#39;s good to do and what not to do. But the real people, the real people, even if they&#39;re in a gang and they really care for you, they&#39;re going to tell you, no. No, this is not for you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I&#39;ve had friends that had family members that were gang bangers and they would say, &quot;No man, stick in school. This is my thing just because I was stupid enough not to focus on school.&quot; But I didn&#39;t have that, so I had to, like, really crookedly find my way to be straight. It was...</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when did you figure out or did you know all along that, you were undocumented, that there was just going to be these barriers or things you weren&#39;t going to be able to do that your peers could do.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At the beginning, I wasn&#39;t quite aware except for, you know, the language barrier. Then you kind of feel it inside that there&#39;s something that you&#39;re doing wrong. There&#39;s this constant feel of fear that whatever you do wrong he will retaliate considerably. Until I started to get along and catch up with news and then started to understand the language that, what had happened wasn&#39;t correct. And I understood that eventually.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever drive?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Drive, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you drove without a license or did you... Were you-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, of course I drove... No. Of course, I drove without a license.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you get a fake license? Did you...?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were careful?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, of course I was. Yeah, of course. If you already know that you&#39;re illegally on a place where you shouldn&#39;t be, at least, because you&#39;re doing it legally for that part, why would you do something reckless to get busted? For example, I remember that, and I have always laughed at my uncle for this. He was the one that taught that. He was, &quot;If you&#39;re in this country illegally, which is wrong because you&#39;re breaking laws, why would you break more laws so you can get kicked out and lose the opportunity that you&#39;re being offered?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And he got deported because he drank and drove and he crashed against a pole and I was just laughing at him. Because he was the one that-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was saying this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh huh [affirmative]. Saying that to me. So it was like, hey?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you resentful?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of being illegal. Of being undocumented.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I was. I was resentful that for field trips for example, from my high school or middle school, they used to make field trips. Twice, they went either to Water World or they went to Disneyland and things like that and I couldn&#39;t go. So, I was really resentful that it wasn&#39;t fair that I didn&#39;t have the opportunity because I was there illegally. So, I had to miss that different types of opportunities of enjoying my childhood as it was, to play, enjoy with my friends and have that experience or at least make friends.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what was the event that led your mother to say either you start doing more better in school or you leave?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. My mom, when we were living in Phoenix, all the time that we lived in Phoenix, she was single. I mean, she dated every now and then, it was understandable. I didn&#39;t agree with it, but it was understandable. She found a boyfriend and we moved in with him. So, from Phoenix, we moved to Mesa and that last move is the one that, I just couldn&#39;t take anymore because if I was already some... I have finally found a point where I can focus without going astray and then she decided for us to move and I didn&#39;t think it was fair, so I told her that I could stay if I could stay. I wanted to stay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were in 11th grade.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I was in seventh grade about... No, I was in eighth grade. Seventh about to be eighth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Eighth.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I wanted to stay, and I told her that I could stay with my aunt and she didn&#39;t want to because she said that a family is supposed to stick together. So, unwillingly, I had to go. So, went to live in Mesa, as I mentioned, then I went there to ______ High School.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is that Colorado or it&#39;s still Arizona.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s still Arizona.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s still Arizona. So, I went to ______ High School, _______ Road. When I was there, everything that I had on my previous high school or the way that the teachers were teaching, it was considerably different. For example, even the way they taught French. The only things that kept me settled and focus on my studies, they were changed, so I was like, okay.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, French and art.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The way that they were teaching, it was different. Art is something that you can understand, or at least I can understand it, but I didn&#39;t have problems with that. But the way that the teacher was teaching a different language, it was different than my other teacher was teaching it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So for example, at my first high school, I remember that my teacher told us, &quot;The way that I&#39;m going to teach you guys is something that you guys are already used to. Learning it from music, television, books because that&#39;s how you guys already learn the language.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I do remember that she said, &quot;It&#39;s not a discrimination if you guys are not native speakers because you guys do understand it. But if you guys are, I think this will help you guys.&quot; So, I remember that every time we had a question or something like this, she would reply back first in the language, in English in this case, and then in French. So, we can relate.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In this new high school, it wasn&#39;t that way. It was&hellip; she would always speak French whether you understood it or not. And everything was on French for that matter. And I do understand that part but it&#39;s different ways of teaching that felt complicated. Then it was math, English and so on and so forth. And then I had... I think I didn&#39;t have a personal issue with my mom&#39;s boyfriend because I do remember that we did get along. But on certain things, we considerably disagreed one with the other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, pressure there. And then pressure trying to get along with people who I didn&#39;t know at all on my new school and things like this. I think they contributed into me starting to fail. I&#39;d like to think that way instead of definitely just not caring. Because I do remember that for example, there was this one program that is in Arizona. I don&#39;t know where you guys are coming from but in Arizona there is this one program which is called Bridges.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, it started when I was in middle school and it was from ASU. And at the beginning it was Bridges to High School and then from there, Bridges to College. And I got into there for my grades when I went to Dobson. Then my grades started to fail. And by this time, I was... In Dobson, I finished sophomore year and I went into junior. That&#39;s where I couldn&#39;t complete my studies.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then I had a girlfriend and things just went stray a little bit. I started slacking off and then I could... Up to this point, I had learned how to deal with discrimination and racism and those comments and all. But the way that it got on that school, it was&hellip; it was considerably heavy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do remember the majority of the people who were in there were Caucasian. I&#39;m not quite sure. It&#39;s different points of view. But I do remember that... I do remember that this one time, I was going in, into high school. I was walking in through the parking lot. And the security guard, he just stares at me because for some reason, I stared at a car. I remember, I remember it was a nice car, I liked the car.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. And the security guard just came out to me and he said, &quot;Don&#39;t be thinking about stealing it.&quot; And I just turned around, I was like, &quot;I study here.&quot; He was like, &quot;Show me your ID.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Really? I&#39;m telling you that I&#39;m studying here but, fine.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;m saying it now like it&#39;s nothing, but at the beginning, it was like, &quot;Really? I will pretend that you didn&#39;t profile me as if I was to steal that car. I&#39;ll pretend I did not hear that.&quot; Then I showed him my ID. And he took me to the principal&#39;s office just to verify if it was original and it wasn&#39;t fake. And then they went through my stuff just to verify that I didn&#39;t have any drugs and, or alcohol.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, it kind of got intense. And I do remember that my mom&#39;s boyfriend, when I told him because I didn&#39;t want to tell my mom.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did they find drugs or liquor?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, of course they didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They didn&#39;t find anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no they didn&#39;t. I don&#39;t like that. I&#39;m already stupid enough to get involved with that type of things. No. No, no they didn&#39;t find anything.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they didn&#39;t punish you or anything, did they?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They just-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, because they have no reason.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They had no reason to, right?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The reason why I didn&#39;t want to tell my mom is because my mom&hellip; she&#39;s pretty apprehensive with that type of thing, the discrimination and things like that so I didn&#39;t want to make a big fuss out of it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, I see.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it&#39;s something that I&#39;ve already dealt with. But I remember that my mom&#39;s boyfriend, because he&#39;s Mexican-American. He saw me sad or angry, I don&#39;t know. I thought I could hide it or anything, but he&#39;s like, &quot;Hey, what happened?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Nothing.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Come on, talk to me. What happened?&quot; And then I told him everything. And he got mad. And I do remember that, he said, &quot;Okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He didn&#39;t tell me anything at the moment. He didn&#39;t tell me anything, he seemed comprehensive. So he took me to school. Well, he took me in, his son, to school.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, we went to school and he took me to the principal&#39;s office and he wanted me to point it out and he dealt with it on a different manner. At the beginning, I do remember that he was really, really, really pissed. And I do remember him saying that it wasn&#39;t comprehendible that just by staring at a car, a kid staring at a car just because of that, they would say that the kid would steal the car. Like, what was going through the person&#39;s head?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know, he was a veteran, so he started pulling the veteran card, things like this. And he started to deal with it on a different manner than my mom would and at the end of the day, the way that I think that he dealt with it, honestly, I think that they listened because he wasn&#39;t an illegal immigrant or he wasn&#39;t an immigrant for that part. That&#39;s the reason why they didn&#39;t put so much pressure on. It didn&#39;t mean that they didn&#39;t, because I could see them, like, circling around me for... But they did. But it wasn&#39;t as much as before and it was weird and I really hated that place. I really did.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when, this one time, I remember that, by this point I already had, I was a junior and my girlfriend was a senior. So, by this point, we hadn&#39;t been to a part of the relationship where it was considerably serious. So, we thought she was pregnant. So, we decided to ditch school to see if she was. If so, to see how was it that we were going to deal with it. If we were going to have it or, if so, what was going to happen between us and things like this. Typical to Hispanic life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry. Anyhow, we got caught trying to ditch because we didn&#39;t even do that properly and up to this point I really didn&#39;t even care about whether I got caught or not. So, they took us to the principal&#39;s office and since they were&hellip; it was about to be two weeks before we finished. I got kicked out just because of that. I didn&#39;t get any warning or any correctional or anything because according to them I didn&#39;t qualify for it because it was too small of a time frame. I was like, &quot;Really?&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you cannot put me in detention for two weeks and just let me go to the next year, you have to kick me out?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kicked you out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They kicked us both out.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you would have had to go repeat your junior year?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was she pregnant?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, she wasn&#39;t, she wasn&rsquo;t. But at least we knew that afterwards.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s good news.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We learned that about a month after we got kicked out of high school. She was about to finish, she was about to go to college. So, that was... Yeah, she was a senior, I was a junior. So, that&#39;s what I had the pressure on because obviously I didn&#39;t want her to be that typical Hispanic girl that before finishing high school she got pregnant and she couldn&#39;t get to college. No, of course I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, even though, even if she was pregnant, I remember telling her, &quot;Even if we find out that you are, it doesn&#39;t matter if I don&#39;t finish studying right now, you finish college. Then if you will like to support me, then I&#39;ll finish high school and get to college and we can move from there when I will support you.&quot; And that&#39;s pretty much what happened. Then-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She came with you to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. No, she didn&#39;t. She was born there. So, I do remember that when my mom told me that either I... Well, pretty much she didn&#39;t give me much of an option up to this point because of that same fact.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">(break in interview)</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, she went to college. She&mdash;well, after I came back, we still kept in contact. Well, obviously distance relationships, they-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was hard though, for you to leave.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Given that you had found her... You said you didn&#39;t have any friends but now you had this serious relationship.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and it was really hard for me to leave. I remember that I told her when is it that I was going to come back and she said that she didn&#39;t want to go to say goodbye. So, I remember that when I got into the bus and started to come back, I saw her car parked and she just started waving at random and I was like, damn.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I wanted to get off but, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t know, up to this point, I guess I would have... I don&#39;t know. Anyhow, when I got here, it was really, really, really difficult to get used to being here at my own country again. It was really difficult regarding for example the language. For me to speak Spanish, it was really hard. It was really hard.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if, when I tried to speak something normal or a normal five-minute conversation, it wouldn&#39;t come out in fully Spanish. And I do remember that and I do remember that kids at my school making fun of me and discriminating again and I was like, really. I just came-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everywhere I go.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was like, really? I was like, all right, fine, doesn&#39;t matter. I dealt with it over there, I can deal with it over here. I do remember that fear that we mentioned previously is actually pretty constant once you get here and you pretty much, you&#39;re an outcast on your own home. It&#39;s really difficult because you don&#39;t know what people are going to do to you, literally.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The first two weeks... Excuse me. The first two weeks, I do remember that all my belongings were with me and I didn&#39;t let them go at all. Literally because I didn&#39;t know how were people going to react in the way that I dress and the way that I talk. I was like, man, this is a really dead giveaway. I&#39;m going to get stolen, I&#39;m going to get beat up, they&#39;re going to steal my things and things like that. Because I remember that couple of my cousins who had come back had gone through that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they started to say, it was the fact that, just because you... They think that just because you come from the United States, they think that you have money and that you have something of value even though it&#39;s not in a lot of cases. For example, the uncle that I mentioned previously that had crashed. He was detained, he was taken to a facility, a couple of months after, he was deported and he had nothing.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they did that to him. Once he arrived to his home town, he got beat up, he got stolen. Since he didn&#39;t have anything, he was beat up even worse because he didn&#39;t have anything. So, I was like, what&#39;s the logic on that? And yeah, I was really afraid. At the beginning I was afraid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take until you felt comfortable here?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did it take for me to get comfortable here? About three... I&#39;m sorry. Honestly, it took me about a year to feel comfortable. It took me about a year to feel comfortable, like fully comfortable. Like saying, okay, this is where I belong or this is-</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you believe it is where you belong now?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, I miss Arizona a lot. I really miss it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I miss for example, there&#39;s this one... It&#39;s funny because where my middle school was, everything behind it were apartment complexes and most commonly you would find all different ethnicities there and that&#39;s what I miss.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For example, the girl behind my apartment, she was Dominican, the guy next to me was Puerto Rican and so on and so forth. So, what I miss is getting to know their culture, their language and what they&#39;re meaning. I love that. That&#39;s what I miss. That... That. For example, the guy above, he was Jamaican, so he used to tell me about his stews and things like this.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that he used to cook a couple of things for me. They were weird and the taste was really strong. And I remember telling him once that, &quot;Dude, what you&#39;re eating is disgusting.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I can say the same thing about what you&#39;re eating.&quot; And then we got along. But that&#39;s what I miss. That&#39;s what I miss. The different ways of knowing cultures without having to leave that place. That&#39;s what I miss. That&#39;s what I love.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think of yourself as a Mexican or an American or something different?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, I just think myself as a citizen of the world. That particular experience, once you get to know that in one single place you can know about what&#39;s going on, on the other side of the world without having to live in it, from someone who&#39;s actually been there, makes you feel on a specific place within the world, you don&#39;t feel small.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the other hand, once you get to know the different ethnicities and what they&#39;re going through is similar to you, you don&#39;t feel that alone. It&#39;s funny actually how you feel regarding that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember that my middle school, there was this one Vietnamese girl. She didn&#39;t speak Spanish at all or English for that matter. And I remember that... Well, it was kind of hard because we kind of, like, projected on her, the discrimination and things. We were like, &quot;Hey, here you go, you can share this.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I do remember that at the beginning she hated us all and pretty much by the end of eighth grade, is it eighth grade? Yeah, eighth grade, I do remember that she spoke Spanish, like really fluid Spanish and English and we started to learn a couple words. I think I remember that, well, she cursed at me but I&#39;m not going to say because it&#39;s an interview.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She cursed at me and when I asked her what it was, she said this, well, F you. I was like, &quot;Oh. Love you too. Thank you.&quot; But you get to learn that. Or for example the struggle that people have for example let&#39;s say in Brazil. For example, the struggle that people go through in Germany and I remember that I had a Russian friend, I remember that had another friend. Well, if I can say that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, people I&#39;ve met that were Jamaican, Cubans, Spanish, African, really African people. And it was cool because for example what they thought it was, the academical thing was ranked within the lowest within the knowledge for some reason. And just because we didn&#39;t know the language, it was amazing how it is that we could find knowledge from different countries and cultures and things like that. Something that the others were pretty much being cut out of and I was like, no, we&#39;re the richest ones and we&#39;re the ones that know more than you do, and you&#39;re not going to understand it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. So, final question. What are your dreams now that you&#39;re back in Mexico? You&#39;ve experienced the U.S.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams. In contrast, after leaving the U.S., being here and seeing what my mom was protecting me from, and now understanding what it is that I was throwing back at her face when I wasn&#39;t supposed to, is finding a better life. Like finishing my studies. It doesn&#39;t matter how it is that I do it, but finishing it&hellip; Which by the way, I have two kids.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my point right now is to pretty much, like, get them to have the idea that just because they&#39;re unable to, at the moment, to know different cultures or ways of thinking and believing, instead of being ignorant and closed and judging, to have that open mind to accept that they&#39;re part of something bigger than what they know. And obviously find a way to have a better life.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1">Jose</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Having a different language on top of the one that you already know does help a lot. It does help a lot. So, yeah my goal in life is learning more languages. I love it. I really do love it and find a way to finish it.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Anne:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s great. That&#39;s amazing. Thank you so much.
