And so to start, maybe could you tell me about when you came to the U.S. from Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, when we came from the U.S. to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or when you came from Mexico to the U.S.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. From Mexico to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I really don&#39;t remember.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was four years old. And I just remember that they took us to... Well, we crossed in a car, and it was me and my brother. We crossed in a car. We got to this house, and we stayed there I think for about a week and then my parents came to pick us up. I&#39;m not really sure if it was near the border or further out into the U.S., but that&#39;s how we got into the U.S. And then we traveled all the way to the state of Georgia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s where you lived? Where you grew up?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s where I grew up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where in Georgia? Near Atlanta?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c13">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was near Atlanta. It&#39;s </span><span class="c10">_____</span><span class="c0">, Georgia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then how old were you when you left the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was 14, about to turn... Well, I was 14 and a half you could say. I was 14.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And you&#39;ve been back here since then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old are you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m 22.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;22. Okay, so looking back on the U.S., going to school there, your childhood, do you have a favorite memory that stands out?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I liked the schools. I know a lot of people don&#39;t like school, but compared to the school here, I like the schools over there. The way they had it. The way they taught you and treated you. I liked the food from school. I guess you could say I liked the environment because it was really green, a lot of trees, lakes, so that&#39;s what I miss a lot. My friends as well, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there anything that you didn&#39;t like about being in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I guess the curfew thing where you couldn&#39;t be out after 12:00 because I was too young. But that was it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you know that you were undocumented as a child?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I did, but I didn&#39;t really pay attention to it or really look into it because I was into other things. I was a young kid, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s not something that you worried about?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so what happened to lead you to come back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My parents got, you can say, they got divorced or they separated. And we still lived there for about a year after they separated. It wasn&#39;t our decision to come back, it was my dad&#39;s decision. He got into a depressed mood, and a therapist would come see us sometimes because of that, to help us. And he had the great idea to come back, reunite with my mom, but at the same time bring us back as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So your mom was already-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. She came back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... Still in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had come back to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She had come back to Mexico. We were still there for about a year with my dad, and then we came back with him so that they could reunite. So I guess you could say it wasn&#39;t our decision, it was theirs, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you said he made the great decision to come back, do you think it was a great decision?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Or were you being sarcastic there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s sarcasm I mean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you feel about it at the time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I feel like they could have figured it out in a different way than just bringing us back to Mexico without us knowing a lot of Spanish and the way things are here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like for you integrating into your school, getting used to life here, after having been in the U.S. for so long?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s hard. I guess because of language. I mean, you&#39;re used to speaking English daily in school with your friends. And you only speak Spanish with your dad sometimes, but you don&#39;t even answer in Spanish sometimes. You answer in English, and they understand what you&#39;re saying. So I guess you could say the language barrier, getting used to the language, understanding some words. And school, they teach a little bit different so I guess school was a bit difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do they teach differently?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They really don&#39;t put too much effort into you learning.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The teachers. Yeah, they don&#39;t invite you into programs after school to really understand what they really need you to learn, and I think that&#39;s what was difficult. Paying attention as well. They see you talking and they see you&#39;re really not paying attention, but they don&#39;t really... I mean, you can say they tell you something like, &quot;Pay attention,&quot; but they don&#39;t encourage you to actually pay attention and learn and the reason why you need to learn, so I guess-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s easy to get distracted in class?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was there anything good about coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I kind of liked it because it opened up my eyes to how the struggle is and the life that we face here is. I didn&#39;t know my parents had to go through this process of growing up and seeing that it&#39;s hard to get money here. Yeah, so that&#39;s the issue.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;ll ever go back to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Hopefully.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What would you do if you go back to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess I would just work. I mean, there&#39;s nothing else to do.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of work would you want to do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess whatever work I could get, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what about if you were to stay here in Mexico? If you couldn&#39;t go back to the U.S., what do you think your future would look like here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I&#39;ve thought about that, and I guess I would save up money and build places where people could rent. So that way I don&#39;t have to work all of my life, and I would just depend on you could say the rent money. That would be my plan if I do decide to stay here, but hopefully not. Hopefully I get to go back someday.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So are you thinking how soon you would try to go back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, you could say I always get that thought of going back every week or every month, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You think about it quite a bit?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you go back again, how do you think you&#39;ll do it? Cross the border or any other way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, we tried to get our visa and... Let me just catch myself, okay? (silence) Sorry, I&#39;m just remembering.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay. You don&#39;t need to apologize. I know it&#39;s hard kind of digging up old memories and reliving some of this stuff. Let me know if you need a minute, if you want to take a break or anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just a lot of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You guys were trying to get a visa?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I&#39;ve got this knot in my throat. It&#39;s kind of hard to speak.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay. Take as long as you need.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. We were trying to get our visa. That was when I was 15 or 16. They denied it. It was me, my brother, and my sister. And then after that, I tried to cross the border, but then we got caught. So that was the only two attempts that we&#39;ve tried, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve been trying for years to get back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What happened when you tried to cross the border again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We got caught, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;On the U.S. side or the Mexican side?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, on the U.S. side. Yeah, we didn&#39;t really get far, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you walking or driving?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, we were walking. Yeah, we were trying to... How could you say it? We paid to cross and we went in groups, but we didn&#39;t really last long. I guess that wasn&#39;t a good idea in my opinion. That was a dumb idea as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What, being in groups?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, just the idea of trying to cross.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, doing it at all. How long had you been walking before you got caught?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like one hour. It wasn&#39;t long, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was really tough.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It wasn&#39;t days. So I mean, I guess it could have been worse, but-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s emotionally though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You probably had your hopes up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Does that experience make you hesitant to try again? Or does it make you still want to try just as hard?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I know I&#39;m going to try it again. But at the same time, I feel if I get caught again, I think it&#39;s like a 10-year ban. So I guess you got to think it straight before you do it. I mean, you&#39;re risking a lot. You might get locked up in jail for a few months, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make it very difficult.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel anger towards the U.S. for all of this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, not towards the U.S. The people over there, I know some people feel the same way as others. Here in Mexico, some people don&#39;t like the immigrants that come from Central America. And I feel like they feel the same way, so I can&#39;t blame them for feeling that way. But I feel like they make it difficult for one to get a visa just to visit, not just to stay. If you want to get a visa to get to be a tourist, they make it really hard. Yeah, I mean, it&#39;s not the people, it&#39;s more like I guess you could say the government.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. But maybe also the people who voted in the government?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, you could say so. Some people here in Mexico feel the same way. They don&#39;t want immigrants to get their visas either, or they&#39;re against immigrants coming to live here or even cross through here, so then they want laws against that, against immigrants coming from Central America. So I mean, everyone in the U.S. and here in Mexico, everyone has the same thoughts you could say, the same opinions towards immigrants.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not everyone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not me. I really don&#39;t care if they come through here because I know that they&#39;re probably struggling more than what we&#39;re struggling here in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think there&#39;s anything that the U.S. government should be doing differently in regards to how migrants are treated?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like overall?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like overall, or in terms of people getting deported? Anything that could be done differently to make things better for people and their families going through this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c10 c13">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I think they could make it a program or something where if you lived in the U.S. and you basically grew up over there or you already have your life over there and you&#39;re get deported, or you just decided to come back voluntarily, that they give you a chance or they hear you out, and they would give you... How would you say it? They would give you </span><span class="c8">esperanzas</span><span class="c0">. I don&#39;t know how to say it. They would give you hope of someday coming back, even if it takes years. You might get your visa within these five or ten years. I&#39;m willing to wait, but they don&#39;t even give you that hope, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What about on the Mexican side? Do you think there&#39;s anything that the Mexican government could be doing differently to help returned migrants coming back from the U.S. or people who&#39;ve been deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess in schools, they could probably maybe explain or have someone that speaks English try to explain until you get used to it the same way that they do in the U.S. When you get over there, they sometimes put you with a Spanish teacher or someone that knows how to speak Spanish and English, and they help you understand at first. So I know they have that program ESOL or something like that, so I don&#39;t know why they can&#39;t-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have something like that in Mexico </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... For people who are used to speaking English and aren&#39;t so good with Spanish. It sucks. I&#39;m sorry for what you&#39;ve been through. It makes me angry. I wish that there was something more that we could do. This is why talking to people like you, and we want to hear from you in your own words to help not just us understand, but to potentially help other people understand too, to see if some kind of change can be made. I&#39;m wondering, this is just a question I have, do you feel more Mexican or more American? Or I&#39;ve heard some people say that they feel like they don&#39;t belong either place, or they&#39;re not from either place, do you ever had thoughts like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know I was born here, and I guess I feel in the middle. I was born here, but I grew up over there, so I kind of represent both places. Well, when I was over there in the States, I always saw myself as I&#39;m Mexican, but I never saw myself as an illegal Mexican. I guess the people that are born over there with both of their parents Mexican, I guess you could say I felt that way. But I always knew where I was born, so I always identified myself as a Mexican and my teachers knew that. My friends knew that, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And now that you&#39;re in Mexico, does some part of you identify yourself as American or just totally Mexican?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I mean, I always see myself as... Well like I said, if I were born over there. But I guess I&#39;m in the middle, I don&#39;t know where I&#39;m from. Yeah, I&#39;m just lost. You get lost. You know you were born here, but you&#39;re not used to the lifestyle 100%, and you grew up all your life over there, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Which place feels most like home for you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The U.S., yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well as we start wrapping up, is there anything that you feel like you haven&#39;t had a chance to share yet? Or what do you want people to understand about you or about people who have had experiences like yours?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not sure. I mean, I guess, &quot;Don&#39;t give up I guess. Life is hard, but you got to work hard to achieve your goals.&quot; So I guess that&#39;s my way of thinking. I&#39;m not going to give up, so hopefully one day I get back. But I wouldn&#39;t like to get back over there crossing the border because acting like that&#39;s not the right thing to do, but like I said before, they make it really hard for you to get a visa, so yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They make it really, really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s raining really, really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Lizzy:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s really, really raining hard now. Well, we really appreciate you coming to talk to us and share your story. Is it okay if I turn the mic off?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Ivan:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1 c11"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c11 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c12"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c3" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c9"><span class="c7"></span></p></td><td class="c19" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c18"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c9"><span class="c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
