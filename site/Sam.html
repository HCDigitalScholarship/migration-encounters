So this is Claudia. I&#39;m interviewing Sam right now. So the first thing that I want to say, and I want to thank you for coming out, talking with us. I understand that speaking about these experiences can sometimes be very difficult because they bring about memories and sentiments and emotions that you don&#39;t really want to feel or think about. But I think it&#39;s important to note how important your story is and how it&#39;s going to help us so much in bringing light on the humanity of migration and on the realities of migration, and so that people hopefully cannot be as stereotypical as they are right now, and they can understand what it&#39;s really like and what it really entails. So thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re welcome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My first question for you is, why did your family leave the United States? You mentioned that you were six months old when you left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I guess to live a better life pretty much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of the fact that you were six months when you left, I don&#39;t expect you to remember your first day, but what is your first or earliest memory of the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My earliest memory is just&hellip; I used to celebrate my birthday every day until I was 11. Well, I was really not a bad, a bad kid. I was a really good kid and I had my studies. Well, that&#39;s pretty much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So you learned English as your first language?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that is correct. That is my first language, native.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In school, did you have any teachers or any friends that you remember specifically fondly then?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I remember a teacher, Mrs. Peach. She was really helpful. She actually put me on the good path and always taught me a motivated person. She always inspired me. She&#39;s actually one of persons I look up to, my teacher. She was my fifth-grade teacher. And I just&hellip;that&#39;s pretty much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your life like in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My life was pretty much like a roller coaster. I could say I went through a lot. I lived my life drastically into a lot of drama, gang violence due to the society and community I used to live in, which is Los Angeles County. That was pretty much it. I try to stay away from gangs and all that, that were influence. That was pretty much it. My life was studying. That was my mother&#39;s saying, your only responsibility until you&#39;re 18 is get your studies. After that, if you want to get a job and you&#39;re 18, you&#39;re sold to do so. You&#39;re above age. But as I&#39;ve seen, I guess... I had a stepfather, so I was isolated from my mother due to she&#39;d make more attention to his husband. So I had to find love that I don&#39;t have in the house at the streets.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when I started involving myself into negativity. At the time, gang was my escape. But in reality, now that I&#39;m at this age and I have my kids and I have a wife, we see that all that gang stuff, all that, it was not worth not one thing. We were actually claiming blocks that weren&#39;t even under our names. We used to put our lives on the front line for that. It was just something that, it was not necessary. I didn&#39;t see no benefit to it, but thanks God, I put my life straight. I got my kids. They&#39;re my motivation. They&#39;re my model to my heart, and as well as my wife. I thank my mom for her not letting me go like that, Because she was always persistent. Make sure that I get the programs, because I was in probation since I was 13.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a cycle that it&#39;s unbreakable. That&#39;s what it&#39;s made for. Probation, it&#39;s a cycle that you can&#39;t break because you&#39;re still... As long as you&#39;re still living in that same place, in the same society, it&#39;s there. To stay away from negativity, it&#39;s hard. It&#39;s easier to be in negativity than being positive until I looked up to my mom and my mom, I see my mom tearing, and what was going on with my sister, because my sister, she was in bad steps as well. So I was following her thinking I was doing the right thing, but then I&#39;ve seen the reality of how much damage I was doing to my family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 16, I opened my eyes and I told my mom, &quot;Look, mom, I know I&#39;m not living with you, but I love you and know that I&#39;m not in negativity no more. I&#39;m actually doing good. And I hope that you could forgive me, but I&#39;m always going to be your son.&quot; My mom&#39;s always been there for me. She has never let me down. Since I was 16, all the way to 18, I stayed good. And then now I&#39;m here and I have a great communication with my mother. I&#39;m a mama&#39;s boy and I&#39;m always going to be. That&#39;s pretty much it right here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So you joined a gang when you were 13?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;13.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. And then despite that you still graduated high school and you went to college, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, that is correct.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You studied?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;College at a local trade college--lube technician. It was a small course. I was a person that was just in negativity as well as one who&#39;s have some schooling to back me up whenever I had a job. So they could see that you have the intention to do good, not just being gang related, describe the person by how they wear their clothing. But as the time passed, I&#39;ve seen that sometimes baggy pants, big shirts could cause problems. To avoid that, I&#39;m a different style now, and it has brought me to a lot of positive ways. It helps me on my jobs. It helps me in the streets and helps me with publicity, and I&#39;m happy with myself now.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome. I want to return to that in a bit, but I want to keep going in chronological order. So tell me about how you ended up in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ended up in Mexico due to I was young and I had a ex-girlfriend. I guess, she stated she was pregnant and why I didn&#39;t believe her. So there was a time that we got into an argument and I told her I don&#39;t want to live with her. She was obsessed to living with me and I didn&#39;t want to live with her. There was a time I just turned around and walked away, and I guess that ticked her off. So she came at me and she&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, you think you&#39;re going to leave me like this?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Well, no, I&#39;m not leaving you. If it&#39;s responsibility for me to be a father, I&#39;ll take further action. But if it&#39;s not, then why would I?&quot; At the end, that wasn&#39;t my kid. I went to jail for that. The mother took me... Well, we got locked up. Both of us got arrested.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I was close to a vehicle. And then that vehicle, well, that&#39;s the vehicle I was driving. And so they took out the license, stuff like that. Well, after that, I have to come straight to the cops. I was 17, and on the identification card, it actually showed 19. I was 18 and it actually showed 19. So the cop said, this is a real license or not. They ran it. Nothing came up. So they took me for a false identity. After that, I didn&#39;t even know that there came more charges to it. After false statements, this is domestic violence. I&#39;m like, &quot;Why would you guys got me for domestic violence?&quot; &quot;Well, the mother came and stated that you hit her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then at the end, they dropped the case for domestic violence, and I just stayed with false statements. Once I went to immigration, well, they stated if I want to fight my case, I could fight it and get bailed out. Or if not, pretty much, I... They provided me the last alternative option, volunteer deportation. That&#39;s what I took because I prefer my freedom than giving my time to just thrown away. So I took the easiest route, and came to Mexico.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;ve been back for how many years?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve been here... I think on November, I&#39;m making six years.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So how has that return been?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was difficult in the beginning. I was depressed for two years. I couldn&#39;t overcome knowing that I was right here and my family over there. I couldn&#39;t do nothing. I felt useless in potential that just the border could actually do so much things, so much emotions. Well, little by little, I had to get the vision that I&#39;m never going to go back over there. That&#39;s what I set my mind to. I set my mind that whatever I had over there, I&#39;m going to have it right here. I&#39;m already paying my house. I&#39;m working on getting a car, and that&#39;s pretty much it. My family has been supportive. My mother has been supportive. I don&#39;t tell them to send me money over there because as well, they cannot. The wealth is difficult over there and that&#39;s pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay, so I want to know... I&#39;m going to backtrack a little bit. I apologize. You were in County jail for nine months, you said in your survey. Tell me briefly how the conditions were there, how they treated you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the food was horrible. Beans with worms, white worms. I wouldn&#39;t eat beans. I&#39;ll just eat... The best thing you could get, it was a bologna sandwich. Even the mustard, the mayonnaise will come expired, even if it was on a little bag. So, I wouldn&#39;t eat, just the plain bologna. Sometimes I&#39;ll have the fortunate that my mom will actually come and visit me, so I&#39;ll get some commissary money. Without the commissary money, people will actually have hunger due to the two, three meals they&#39;re providing. There would be rot food or just not nutritious enough, so you can actually go on day by day. But if you have commissary, yes, you will actually survive. The aspect of them providing you hygiene, it was all right. Yeah, it was all right for the hygiene.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the riots were really pretty intense in there. I&rsquo;ll probably get..they&#39;ll come with the pepper spray grenades. When you&#39;re in there, well, you got to take care of business. You can&#39;t speak much about it. If you&#39;re on a side, well, you got to take your side to the fullest. And if it comes to the point, and if the big man calls shots, you can&#39;t stop until it&#39;s done. That&#39;s pretty much it. You got to take care of business in there. That&#39;s how I&#39;ll most define, I could put it. You got to take care, and you come in there and you&#39;re involved in a gang, you got to just come in there and take care of business pretty much.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you kept being involved in gang activity while you were in the jail?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a must. It&#39;s a must.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. So now coming back to when you came back to Mexico, tell me a little bit more about that whole aspect of family separation and how that was for you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the family separation, because I got deported, and the first thing I did was call my mom. That&#39;s the only supportive person I know, the only person that&#39;s going to respond to you, even when you&#39;re 40, 60, 80 years old. As long as your mom is still living there, she&#39;s going to respond. That&#39;s what I did, called my mother, had the response, and she stated, &quot;Everything&#39;s going to be okay. They&#39;re going to come pick you up.&quot; And yeah, sure enough. They came to pick me up. Well, I had a bad experience in TJ. Got kidnapped. They asked my mother for amount of money, if not, they were going to start chopping me up. So they shot me in the hand and they sent pictures to my mother. They thought I was playing. They thought that we&#39;re playing. But then when they see the tattoos on my hand and my finger thrown off, so my mom started getting scared. I told her, &quot;Don&#39;t send money.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They kept on torturing me and torturing me and shot me in the leg and then hit me with a bat in the face. Then while I was unconscious, I was literally nobody no more. I was just like a blanket just thrown on the street. A lady picked me up. I remember an old lady picked me up and she called a taxi. Taxi came to pick me up, took me on a general hospital, and they put me on anesthesia. When I woke up, I was in a coma for a week, and I called my mom. I still knew my mom&#39;s phone number. They came to pick me up. That same day, I got shipped off to Mexico City in Mexico. I&#39;ve been good since then.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where did the kidnapping happen? Was it in TJ?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That was in TJ, Baja California, and on the front line. Once you cross border your vehicle, right down in front of the McDonald&#39;s, they&#39;ll come and kidnap you. They&#39;re just waiting for people that get transported. They&#39;d look at them with good clothing. They&#39;ll see if you&#39;re a tourist and they&#39;ll persuade you. The moment they see your weakness, they&#39;ll grab you from there and then just put you on a vehicle, and they&#39;ll do what they do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who was it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A criminal organization. I really don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did they have you for?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About 48 hours.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All of that in 48 hours?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No eating. Yeah. They do that just to hunger you. They just want you to give up the money. They&#39;re like, &quot;Call your mother.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I did, she don&#39;t got money.&quot; [Spanish 00:18:09]. Like, &quot;I ain&#39;t got nobody. That&#39;s the only phone number in there.&quot; Bang. There goes the first gunshot. And then, &quot;We know you got money.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I ain&#39;t got no money.&quot; So just to tell them [Spanish 00:18:25]. &quot;I&#39;m all by myself with you guys, if there&#39;s the money, you&#39;ve seen it.&quot; They just stated, &quot;No, you got money&quot;. And there goes the other shot. Then I got hit with a bat. And then at the end, I just got beat up and I&#39;m shot. Thanks God, I survived my gunshot wounds. That was pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s been the hardest part of returning to Mexico for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not seeing my mom, that kills me, my brothers. Me not being there for them, me not being a role model for them, me not being there for my mother and for my sister. So that&rsquo;s pretty much it. That was the reason I was over there. That was the reason. In my part, because I wanted to succeed in there, I have my passport, I have my California ID. Unfortunately, that was not the circumstances. I&#39;m here and I have to make something out of my life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before we get into that, have you gotten any help at all since you&#39;ve returned, either governmental or nongovernmental?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not at all.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. One of the things that my professors are very interested in is specifically this whole idea. They call it made in America, redeemed in Mexico. I&#39;m hearing that you&#39;re very much an example of this. At what point did you decide that you have to turn your life around, and how have you done it? What steps have you taken so far to leave behind the life of being in a gang and being a part of that situation?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the negativity is always going to be there. It&#39;s always going to be there. If you&#39;re looking for it, you&#39;re going to find it. Whether you&#39;re in United States, whether you&#39;re in Italy, whether you&#39;re in Europe, Asia, anywhere, you&#39;re going to find it if you&#39;re looking for it. But it&#39;s up to you to have the willingness and bravery to say, this is not for me. I&#39;m not going to be part of it no more. And if it comes up to the circumstances, sometimes it&#39;s required for you to move against your own gang and tell them and let them know that you&#39;re not part of it, that you have a family, and it&#39;s up to them to respect it or to follow it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my point, and what happened in my case, I got respected, and I don&#39;t owe nothing to them and they don&#39;t owe me nothing. So I&#39;m good on my end and they&#39;re good with me. I closed my relationship well, and I&#39;m just building up my roots. I have a home right here that I know I was never going to have in the United States. I have my own proper house that I&#39;m still paying and still five more years to go. But I believe at the age of 34, I&#39;m going to have my own house, six bedroom house, two rooms. That&#39;s pretty cool. Something that you never could have over there, you got it right here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome. Just for the purposes of... I feel like I understand a little bit, but talk me through the negativity per se because you talked a lot about that. I just want to know what you mean.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, in the negativity? Well, in the part of the negativity, we cannot get in too much detail to it due to that&hellip;you can&#39;t really talk about that, but going...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A little bit. Well, just being involved in gangs, being at the corner of hustling, it comes up to the point, you&#39;re going to have to grab a firearm and do what you got to do, you know. Other than that, that was pretty much all about a gang. Just represent where you&#39;re from and just show that you got your neighborhood stable. Don&#39;t let no other gangs come in inside your neighborhood and attack on the streets, make sure that you had people know that your gang was up there, that they were controlling, patrolling like the cops. That&#39;s what we do. We&#39;re our own cops. We patrol. It&#39;s the same thing, but we&#39;re just with no badges.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think that? Why do young Mexican men, why do so many of them in the United States turn to crime and to gangs?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One thing, it&#39;s due to the family, due to it all comes from within home. You don&#39;t get the love you need, or two, you got everything you want and you go look for it. Or the other one is that you see that your mom is busting her everything, and she still can&#39;t make it. So what do you see in a gang? You walk down the street at the age of 13. You&#39;re seeing big people flashing their money, flashing chains, rappers that are coming in hard talking about they got money. So you see all that. That&#39;s persuading, you start liking it and you like their culture.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, that&rsquo;s how in my point of view, that&#39;s why I felt like, &quot;Oh, man, I like this&quot; and I like the... You know? I started liking it because I wouldn&#39;t find the love I had at the house. So I started liking that gang stuff and it came up to the point and I started winning a lot of money. I bought my mom&#39;s first car. I still remember that. My mom&#39;s like, &quot;How did you get all this money?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Don&#39;t worry. As long as I&#39;m still bringing in food to the chain, you&#39;ll be good.&quot; Little by little, I started making my hustle. I always liked to be by myself. I always used to roll by myself and then I have some followers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then after that, signed it up in jail, back and forth. I was in a lot of negativity. And then until I got deported, that&#39;s when I realized, I&#39;m like, &quot;Man, where&#39;s where&#39;s my hood at?&quot; I&#39;m calling in, they don&#39;t answer me. I&#39;m telling to deposit me some commissary money so I can have some food in there. They weren&#39;t there. That&#39;s when that hit me to the face, took out that blind. I was blindfolded. After that, I realized everything, and my wife told me, she&#39;s like, &quot;They ain&#39;t your family.&quot; And then the family that I had, they came over here and my wife came over here. My kids came over here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, really?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My wife, she was pregnant.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you met her in the United States and you all moved here when you got deported?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. From Huntington Beach.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow. Is she an American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She was born right here, but her whole life. But she came over here with... Basically, she came over here for love. She didn&#39;t have no papers, no visa, no nothing. That&#39;s why we can&#39;t go back. But if a person really loves you, they will do that extra mile like my wife did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You should have brought them over. Also, because that&#39;s also one thing that they&#39;re looking at is the families that come back together. So I guess, talk to me about what that was like and how has it been to have everyone as a unit here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, it&#39;s really cool. Having your family together and making your own empire because that&#39;s what I&#39;m doing. I&#39;m making my own kingdom. I have my own house. That&#39;s my castle. I could die right there because that&#39;s my own property. That&#39;s pretty much it. I&#39;m building my own empire and I have my two little soldiers. They&#39;re two boys, one of seven, and one is nine. It&#39;s just pretty cool. You know? I&#39;m just going day by day and working everything out.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. That&#39;s awesome. Yeah. Sorry about that. Now I can&#39;t hear you. I want to make sure that we have a good sound. Wow. That&#39;s pretty cool. I thought that you had met them here in Mexico. That&#39;s what I thought.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, no.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But it&#39;s a different woman than the one who had-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Okay. Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say I&#39;m proud to be Mexican. I&#39;m proud to be Mexican. I liked the way I used to live in the United States. I would like to visit over there one more time just to see my mother, hug her, kiss her, and tell her that I&#39;m always going to be here for her, but other than that, I don&#39;t need to go to the United States. Donald Trump is just a racism person, stereotype. I want to be in my country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A lot of migrants say that they are neither here nor from there. That&#39;s the sentiment that we&#39;ve heard a lot. I just want to see if you could speak on that and what do you make of it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;About the statement that you&#39;re neither here nor from there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s because I left something over there, which is my family. And then right here, where it&#39;s I have my kids. That&#39;s why I feel like I&#39;m not nor here nor from there, but I call myself Mexican. Yeah. I consider myself more Mexican than anything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So if you could have stayed in the United States, what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would have turned myself around. I would have gone to a different whole type of district, and as well, build my empire because once I was already incarcerated, that&#39;s when I realized what was going on and I wanted to turn myself around. I did turn myself around, but it was too late. That&#39;s why I&#39;m here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you think you&#39;d like to do now that you&#39;re back in Mexico? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just getting my house, having a brand-new car off the lot and growing my kids. That&#39;s pretty much it. Make sure they have resources and make sure I put their savings for them to go to university. That&#39;s pretty much it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m just going to ask you two questions, more so to reflect, and then I&#39;ll be done with my questions. What can the Mexican government do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How Mexicans could actually become migrated back to the Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reintegrated.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reintegrated to the Mex-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like, reintegrado.. [Spanish 00:31:55].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;para que ellos sean ciudadanos estadounidenses? (so that they can be US citizens?) </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no. Que puede hacer el gobierno Mexicano para facilitar la integracion de los&hellip; (what can the Mexican government do to facilitate the integration[Spanish 00:32:02].</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;de los inmigrantes (of the immigrants)</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a lot of jobs, a lot of resources that we just could come, and shelters that actually have the capability to have partnership with companies, bilingual companies, that if they&#39;re not actually capable of having... If they don&#39;t have the shelter, they don&#39;t have anything, a shelter that can actually provide you with the interviews and the three meals. So that would actually have the capability for the migrant to have the motivation, knowing that we&#39;re giving them the extra mile to find a local job as soon as possible. So they could actually regenerate and probably heal that heart, heal that emotion that he just went through from crossing the border because it impacts a lot of people like it impacted me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the United States government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave behind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really hard because a lot of people, my point of view... I felt like I did deserve to get deported, and some people don&#39;t deserve to get deported. In my point of view, I took it as a win and a loss. A loss because I lost my family and everything, a win because I&#39;m a whole new me, and I thank Donald Trump for that. That&#39;s pretty much it. If not, if I would have still been in LA, I would&#39;ve still been in gangs. I probably would have been killed. That&#39;s why I try to thank him. I take it as a loss and win. I didn&#39;t get nothing of it, and I didn&#39;t lose nothing of it. I didn&#39;t win, but now that I&#39;m in my country, I&#39;ve seen nothing but winning. That&#39;s my vision.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s amazing. Well, these are all my questions pretty much. So now I just want to give you the time to say anything else that you want to add. Anything that you felt like you didn&#39;t tell me or something that you want me to know or anything that you just want to have. You want to clarify something, whatever it may be. Now&#39;s the time for you to just talk to me if you want to.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, in my case, well, just pretty much just if this interview could actually help out, just give it to the publicity so we could actually help out the people that are actually being deported. Right now, as we speak, this is happening daily. I remember when I got deported, I got deported with nine buses. Each bus carried about 60 to 80 people a piece. So you could say about what, 900 people got deported in one day at the same time. It&#39;s crazy. This deportation is crazy. Hopefully Donald Trump could actually see that we&#39;re actually hard workers, not like them white boys and black people.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m not racist, and I&#39;m always going to love United States because of them I have schooling, and I learned English. It&#39;s a real advantage anywhere you go being bilingual. It&#39;s going to help you anywhere. Well, I thank them for giving me schooling and for making me a better person. That&#39;s pretty much it. And I just thank my mom, because she made me a good person. That&#39;s pretty much it, and that&#39;s I got to say.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So are you satisfied with everything that you said?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool. So I&#39;m just going to end it here then. Thank you very much.</span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Sam:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay.</span></p><p class="c0 c8"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.58fae85fc1d07e1493d51db806e6dac2eec81174"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c10"><tbody><tr class="c3"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c13"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c7"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
