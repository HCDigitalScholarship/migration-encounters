And I&#39;m here with Miguel now doing the interview portion. So just to start, do you mind going back, just to your first time migrating to the U.S. and what factors drove you from Mexico to the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got there, like I said, before I was seven years old, and I realized why, why they took me out </span><span>of my</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;place because my mom, my sisters, everybody came from Mexico. And for some reason my grandma sent me to the States. And when I was on the border, I remember </span><span>I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>was in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a car. It was the cops and the policemen at the border, it was with their flashlights aimed to my head. And I realized like, &quot;What&#39;s happening?&quot; I didn&#39;t understand what was happening, I was a kid. When I go in there I realized, like I said, in California, there&#39;s a large Hispanic community. So I was recei</span><span>ved</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like warm. I was feeling warm. But, obviously </span><span>was like </span><span class="c0">saying to my grandfather, &quot;You know what? I want to go back to Mexico. I miss my mom</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I don&#39;t feel better here</span><span>,</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I don&#39;t know what the people are saying.&quot; Because I didn&#39;t speak English.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s why when I started to speak English, it was like &quot;okay, I understand what you were saying, on a one-to-one.&quot; Or sometimes I realized </span><span>where is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the difference between the culture. That was the first thing because </span><span>when they&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in the States, the Mexican community or Hispanic community, they are together. When I went back to here in Mexico, the people is not like that here. Everybody&#39;s fighting each other. Instead of help out each other, the people is trying to get an advantage of you. They will cheat on you, even if they&#39;re your family. So th</span><span>at&rsquo;s happening </span><span class="c0">over there in the States, but her</span><span>e - when you&rsquo;re in the States,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all the Hispanic people is like... They&#39;re more protective </span><span>o</span><span class="c1 c0">f each other.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So since you mentioned you came to the U.S. a little bit older, so it was probably slightly more difficult to pick up English then someone who was brought over when they were a couple months old. Were you a part of an English as a Second Language? Any program like that, to help you learn English or no?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, actually, no. Just I went to school and you&#39;re starting to doing it because every day you&#39;re listening English and stuff, so that&#39;s why you get it. But I wish to be there before, like five, three years old. Because I got friends like that. Their first language was English and then Spanish. So that&#39;s why I realized</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">it was</span><span>&nbsp;not</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;perfect </span><span>and</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;all. I&#39;m still </span><span>doing</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;mistakes right now</span><span>, e</span><span class="c0">ven if I&#39;ve been there 10 years, but simply not a lot of mistakes. I mean, I started speaking every day, but that was because </span><span>I would study</span><span class="c0">. I was like, If I ever finish my high school and then I</span><span>&rsquo;d be </span><span class="c0">doing university</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>S</span><span class="c0">o now you&#39;ve got to realize, my English could be better</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>B</span><span class="c1 c0">ut as well, I want to improve it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even if I&#39;m there, I can study over here, or like I say, go to Canada. And then I start again, because daily basis. It&#39;s about the lifestyle. Because when I g</span><span>e</span><span class="c0">t here, I just started to live with one of </span><span>my</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;friends, </span><span>one from Vegas, </span><span class="c1 c0">like I told you, and a girl from California as well. So I realized they&#39;re native speakers. So they taught me a lot about how to speak better, sound more confident, but yeah.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And these were your friends you made there? Can you tell me a bit about what it was like making friends in school? Did you like school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. The school, yeah, because I&#39;m white, I want to sound like I&#39;m as a good as whites, so th</span><span>at</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;people aren&#39;t going to realize I was Mexican. They&#39;ll say like </span><span>m</span><span class="c0">aybe, </span><span>&ldquo;Y</span><span class="c0">eah, because </span><span>he&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;American.&quot; </span><span>Right now I say I&rsquo;m</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mexican, I&#39;m proud of that. But yeah, I got friend</span><span>s</span><span class="c0">, most likely </span><span>they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Hispanic, because all the neighbors in my neighborhood. And at the school, yeah. At least I talk with everybody. I&#39;m being that kind of person. Like, I will pay mine, and if you need something you can </span><span>count</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>on</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;me and </span><span>I&rsquo;ll</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;help you out. I got your back. So that&#39;s why I always, always, because while my grandfather told me as well, &quot;You know what? Everybody that needs help, you will need help someday. So you need to receive back. You need to give it and then you can get it back.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like that&#39;s specific to your grandfather? You feel that&#39;s an American value or if it&#39;s a Mexican value? Where do you think that comes from?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I think it was from my father, my grandfather, he was Mexican, like </span><span>I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;said. I think it was most likely like Mexican culture, because here you can see the families living together. Even i</span><span>f </span><span class="c0">you have more than 30 years old, they still together. And then in the </span><span>S</span><span class="c1 c0">tates, it&#39;s like, &quot;No. You know what? You have your job, so get out of here.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;More independent.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</span><span>&nbsp;Here in M</span><span class="c0">exic</span><span>o it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0 c1">&nbsp;not like that. So that&#39;s why I prefer just... Actually, it&#39;s not long time since I&#39;ve been living alone. So I realized I really got somewhere for my things, and I don&#39;t want anyone to tell me what to do. That&#39;s why when I get back to back to Mexico, and that&#39;s why I just left my grandma&#39;s house, and I started living by myself.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. In terms of outside of school, what you like to do, when you started forming your passion for film and movies, or really just what did you like to do in your childhood and going into high school?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In my childhood, I remember the first cameras, like the Super 8, and used to film the grass, or, you know, there was a little girl over there, just filming her. And not like as a stalker, because</span><span>&nbsp;f</span><span class="c0">or me, beauty is even in humans, and as well as in a woman. Because for me, woman is a representation of the muse. </span><span>There is</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;like </span><span>Carl Jung, who </span><span class="c0">is a psychologist. Say, &quot;Okay, the human has this archetypes or these things, like they&#39;re conscious</span><span>ness</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>like </span><span class="c0">behaviors.&quot; We can show it as a muse or as the wise. So for me, I used what was following the muse. Actually I went up to her, like a girl, like talking to me and to her. </span><span>It </span><span class="c0">say</span><span>s </span><span class="c0">poetry</span><span>&nbsp;here, right? [referencing a tattoo that says &ldquo;poetry&rdquo; behind his ear]</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Because ever since I was kid, I fall in love with the Spanish, with the Spanish writers. In English and [inaudible 00:05:56], but poetry in the Arabic, [inaudible 00:05:59] I got in the </span><span>ear</span><span class="c0">. In poetry in </span><span>the ear</span><span class="c0">. </span><span>. </span><span class="c0">It was my first film, </span><span>short</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;film. Yeah. That&#39;s why I always fall in love </span><span>with</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;arts.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I can see that now. We can get some cool photos of that later if you want though. So that&#39;s kind of when you started developing that. And then you mentioned earlier this dynamic of knowing people who are in gangs in California, </span><span>in </span><span class="c0">Chicano communities where you were. And you were drawn to that for the culture, but then your family protected you</span><span>. D</span><span class="c1 c0">o you mind explaining when you first got interested and kind of what kept you out of it?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. Because I was like, &quot;You know what? I want to go over there, take a ride with the homies and stuff.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So were you friends with them already? Or like, how did that happen?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span><span>. A</span><span class="c1 c0">t the beginning it was my interest, it was about the outfit, how it looks like, with the hats.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The style?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, the style. And I really liked the music and everything. But my grandfather told me, &quot;No, no, you cannot go over there because if you start doing that, then when you&#39;re </span><span>going to grow</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;older, or you&#39;re </span><span>going to go to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the parties, you&#39;re </span><span>going to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;start, you</span><span>&nbsp;know,</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;interested in drugs or something like that.&quot; So that&#39;s why I just read it from the outside. I used to take pictures of that. Actually, I got a collection of those pictures in the &#39;90s. It was really, really cool.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you ever actually hang out with them or was it more from afar?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. More like kind of far. Yeah. Always good distance. Because my grandfather told me like, &quot;No, I don&#39;t want to let you go over there with them because I know somehow they&#39;re going to </span><span>recruit</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you to go to the gan</span><span>g,&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>and that&rsquo;s tough</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span class="c0">ecause that&#39;s why, because you&#39;re Hispanic. Actually, there&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, if you&#39;re Mexican, you&#39;re going to </span><span>stay here in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;California, you will follow the line.&quot; And then they will start, like I say, doing drugs, or then it&#39;s going guns. But for me it was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m considered from the outside.&quot; I kind of learned from that, from the outside. But it&#39;s not what I want for my life. To be honest, yes, I was interested to get to a party and the stuff, but </span><span>I</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hav</span><span>e</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;other plans</span><span class="c1 c0">, you know?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">So that&#39;s why as a </span><span>filmmaker</span><span class="c0">, as a creator, since I was kid, I was like, I need to observe.</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">I need to watch what&#39;s happening from the outside. Then I can make a judgment. Or I can make</span><span>&nbsp;a</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;history. Because if you&#39;re inside, you can</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;realize &nbsp;what&#39;s happening, you&#39;re involved. And then, you don</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;realize what</span><span>&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">happening</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>W</span><span class="c0">hen you got on the outside</span><span>. Y</span><span class="c0">ou can study</span><span>, y</span><span class="c0">ou kind of get an analysis. But that&#39;s why I prefer to just keep inside and in school</span><span>, e</span><span class="c0">verybody kn</span><span>o</span><span class="c0">w me. But I just went to school, go home and take pictures, play soccer, something like that in the streets. That&#39;s it. </span><span>As a kid.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, just from like your outside perspective, like observing it. One of our professors is really interested in the trends of undocumented youth, especially going into gangs, or being affiliated with gangs. What do you think are the factors that kind of drive a young person to become involved in gangs and enter that sort of cycle?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah </span><span>b</span><span class="c0">ecause they know </span><span>they have money</span><span class="c0">. They have money even if they&#39;re not working because they&#39;re selling weed. Because other people say like, &quot;Where do these people even enter my country, United States, if you&#39;re getting drugs.&quot; Because you&#39;re the consumer, because you&#39;re my client. Because if you want drugs, I got the drugs. You want weed, I got the weed. You wan</span><span>t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the coke, I got the coke. So you&#39;re the consumer in the States, so your people is buying my stuff. So, okay. What is the problem? If the public&#39;s already changed, right now it&#39;s legal, and you can get it for recreation. But in that time, it was like they&#39;re interested </span><span>in</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it because you got money. The </span><span>girls</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;looking at you because</span><span>&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">like white girls</span><span>, </span><span class="c1 c0">they like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>P</span><span class="c0">eople here in Mexico, I don&#39;t understand. Like, &quot;You know what? I got a problem. I like </span><span>cholos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a lot.&quot; And it&#39;s like, &quot;Girl, take care of yourself. Be safe first.&quot; Because I always, I been trying to be romantic. My friends told me it&#39;s because you&#39;re so courtesy, because you&#39;re sort of romantic and the people is not looking for that. They&#39;re looking for money or power or </span><span>color tattoos</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;and that stuff, it could be in jail. I don&#39;t know. And just was like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not like that. I&#39;m sorry girl.&quot; I&#39;m sorry.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to disappoint, I never got involved.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sorry to disappoint you, but I never involved again.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, that&#39;s kind of the other, the flip side, that our professors also been studying. It&#39;s kind of like the rate of teen pregnancies for young girls who kind of do get involved. And a lot of times there is an overlap. So do you think there is sort of a specific attraction to that type of masculinity, I guess?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span><span>&nbsp;I guess </span><span class="c0">for that, for the image. Because actually, right now they have social media, but before it was scenes for history, like 200 years ago, in that </span><span>century</span><span class="c0">. </span><span>T</span><span class="c0">hat part of California was for Mexico. </span><span>B</span><span class="c0">elongs to Mexico. So that&#39;s why the people reclaim, and they say like, &quot;You know what? This is my place. Even though you put the border, that was my place, I</span><span>&rsquo;m going to </span><span class="c0">cross over there. I&#39;m going to </span><span>live</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there. I&#39;m going to make a lot of kids. It&#39;s going to be Mexico again.&quot; California</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>there&rsquo;s </span><span class="c0">some places, you</span><span>&nbsp;cannot</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;notice a difference. It could be like a neighborhood here in Mexico, over there in California.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s really interesting in terms of putting it in context with history and stuff. Can you tell me a bit about your choice to come back to Mexico and sort of partially for independence? How did you get to that point?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Because like I said, this guy learned that wasn&#39;t my family. One of them </span><span>was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kind of my uncle, told me like, &quot;Hey, if your son go to the parties and that stuff, what did your father didn&#39;t want for you</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;So you just go to Mexico, right to your place and do whatever you want.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And it&#39;s like, &quot;Okay, that&#39;s what I want. That&#39;s what I&#39;m going to do.&quot; So I just take my ticket and go back to Mexico. And I went here like, &quot;Oh, my god, what I did?&quot; I was like, &quot;Oh, my god. I lost a big opportunity to grow up.&quot; I realized like, &quot;No, </span><span>here</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in Mexican, you can do it as well.&quot; Actually, here, the thing is a bunch of words</span><span>, </span><span class="c0">because the English, because when I got here, my Spanish was really bad. I needed to practice a lot. So it was the first problem. The second was the mindset of Mexicans. Like I said, I was there in the States, the Mexican</span><span>s are </span><span class="c1 c0">used to start helping each other. Like here in Mexico, it&#39;s not like that.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The people is, like I say, cheating on you or always trying to get an advantage of you or because you got money, they&#39;re saying they&#39;re your friends. What I needed to realize when my friend told me, &quot;Don&#39;t trust anybody, not even yourself. First you, second you, and third you. Don&#39;t trust anybody, even yourself.&quot; So that&#39;s why when I came from Mexico, I realized you need to take a look and really watch what is the other intention of the person. Actually, when I </span><span>fell</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;in love here once, I realized once like, &quot;Oh, my god. The girls really like to play with guys,&quot; because they </span><span>take</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;advantage. </span><span>So</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I had realized like, yeah, first it&#39;s self love and then you can share love with someone else.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I realized you know what? I just want to do my job, grow up, go to Canada. And if something happened in the middle, it&#39;s okay. But I&#39;m focused. I got my goal, I got my goal. So I just go for it. So what I realized here in Mexico, the first thing I was, I don</span><span>&rsquo;t </span><span class="c0">want to get stuck, learning drugs, learning anything else. You just want to go to school. And then, like I said, I studied cinematography and then just </span><span>continued</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;working.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I can only </span><span>imagine</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;there&#39;s a lot of temptation to kind of fall into those sort of different avenues that take you off your path. Where do you thi</span><span>nk, that</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;vision or drive</span><span>...</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;that self-discipline I guess is a good way of saying it, came from.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Self discipline, yeah. Actually, by myself, because like I said, most of my life I&#39;ve been doing by myself. So that&#39;s why I realize, &quot;Okay, Miguel, that&#39;s you, second you, third you</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&quot; right? So when I got here it was like, &quot;Okay.&quot; Because I got, like I said, since I really like to learn from the outside perspective, like you say, I realized how the Mexicans do it as well. So I learned from the American style and kind of learn from the Mexican style. So I know what is good, what is bad, what I like for my people, is they really </span><span>being</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;loyal. When they say, &quot;I got your back,&quot; they really got your back.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you feel it&#39;s real, it&#39;s true, you feel </span><span>it</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here, in your heart. It&#39;s not something you need to go do with your mind. There&#39;s </span><span>no </span><span class="c0">intellectual meaning, intellectual thinking</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;i</span><span>t&rsquo;s just,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you feel it. And it&#39;s real difficult over there in the States because they have more skills, more peoples skills, and they can lie, and you realize like, &quot;Oh, my god. I believe in him and what happened?&quot; So it&#39;s my instinct, that&#39;s my... Because maybe I</span><span>&rsquo;m</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>from</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No, that&#39;s really interesting.</span><span>&nbsp;Y</span><span class="c0">ou said you were born in Mexico, you grew up until you were </span><span>in elementary</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;school and came to the U.S. And then you chose to go back to Mexico, but then you think you&#39;ll eventually end up back in the U.S. to study and probably live a life in between the two? Is kind of what I seem to be getting. Do you feel like you are more, like in your soul, more of Mexico or more of the United States?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, I feel more Mexican. </span><span>T</span><span class="c0">he people from the States, they know what they want. And they like to </span><span>be</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;organized. Most</span><span>ly</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;people, like I said, from New York. They told me, &quot;You know what? You need to go pay your bills. You need to do exercise. You need to do this</span><span>&nbsp;and </span><span class="c0">this and that.&quot; So actually I used to start to learn martial arts. So actually I just came from my trainer. That&#39;s why I got my like</span><span>&nbsp;[references outfit</span><span class="c0">]. That&#39;s why I realized, when I get here, I need something to keep in discipline. That&#39;s what I took from the States. That skill. </span><span>This is missing</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;here in Mexico. I been disciplined, focused on something. So that&#39;s what I learned from there, and I just keep it here.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. Do you feel like this kind of discipline, finding different avenues of martial arts, some</span><span>thing to </span><span class="c1 c0">kind of focus your energy?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c1 c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>A</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;lot of people we&#39;ve talked to who have been in gangs and affiliated with gangs and they&#39;re back in Mexico, a lot of times they regret the mistakes they made, especially if they have children and they&#39;re like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">I didn&#39;t want to be the dad that I had and now I can&#39;t be there for my kids.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;That kind of dynamic, which I&#39;m sure if you&#39;ve talked to people</span><span>, y</span><span class="c1 c0">ou probably have heard of some similar stories. Do you think that finding different ways to focus the energy of young people could be a way to kind of avoid entering gangs? Or do you think it has to do with they really have to have parental figures who are more strict and are like, &quot;You can&#39;t go there.&quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think somehow, when you&#39;re a kid, you&#39;re trying to follow </span><span>an</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;example. You&#39;re trying to follow someone like, &quot;Okay, it works for my parents, I&#39;m going to do it for myself.&quot; Or when you grow up and realize it depends on you. So I don&#39;t want to say like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Because my father was in a gang, I need to be in a gang.&quot; No, because at the end it&#39;s your decision, it&#39;s your life. And I say</span><span>&nbsp;like</span><span class="c0">, actually, that happened when my friend, because </span><span>his</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;father was here, over here in the state of Mexico, and </span><span>it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;really dangerou</span><span>s, ____ Morelos, </span><span class="c0">since the early teen years. And he was following all the same mistakes like his father did. And so it was like, </span><span>&ldquo;Bro, you know</span><span class="c0">, you&#39;re a new person. You don</span><span>&rsquo;t </span><span class="c0">need to follow all this stuff. You can create a new life because you have a second chance because you can die over there.</span><span>&rdquo;</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">You could die over there in </span><span>Vegas</span><span class="c0">, or you could die here in Mexico. And you still </span><span>are</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;alive, so do something. You have another chance of... let&#39;s do something else.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;And he was like, </span><span>&ldquo;</span><span class="c0">Yeah, you have a point right there because I don&#39;t want to get stabbed, or get shot or die </span><span>just</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;because I&#39;m following the same mistakes.</span><span>&rdquo;</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;So at the end, I think, it most likely depends on every person, because everybody is free to decide what they want for their lives. So for me, it&#39;s like that, it&#39;s on you, it&#39;s on you. It depends up to you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess it&#39;s kind of a balance. I think, yes, you have individual choices, but also when you&#39;re so young, you really don&#39;t know what you want or what your actions now are going to lead to. You know what I mean? Like when you&#39;re a kid and you&#39;re doing what other kids are doing, or you&#39;re doing what your older brothers are doing, you&#39;re not really thinking that this is going to lead to you going to a country you may not even know when you&#39;re 18 down the line. I guess there is choice, but there&#39;s also a lack of information and awareness, I feel like also. Do they have the information to make an informed choice?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I think it&#39;s a complicated balance, but it&#39;s interesting that you&#39;re kind of bridging this gap of not being a part of it, but then having that perspective in these conversations. Is there anything like that, you don&#39;t think that I&#39;m really getting at</span><span>?</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;I feel like you&#39;ve had much more experience talking to people who have lived that sort of cycle. Anything that stands out to you from your experience with that?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what I realized is like I said, loyalty. When people say like, &quot;I got your back,&quot; they really got their back. But sometimes, like I said, I don&#39;t trust anybody, but at </span><span>the</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;end, what I learned is the gang over there, it&#39;s because they know there&#39;s another big country so they can do whatever they want because they&#39;re affecting Americans, not Mexicans. They&#39;re selling drugs and doing crystal, or selling all of this stuff that affects American people. They don&#39;t give a...</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You can say it.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They don&#39;t give a fuck. They don&#39;t give a fuck because, yeah, at some point you&#39;re their clients. And maybe you&#39;re going to give </span><span>the</span><span class="c0">m my money because your dad is rich or because you got a good job or whatever, give it to me. I don&#39;t care. You want the drugs, I got it. What you want? So that&#39;s why I realize. I&#39;m not going to agree</span><span>&nbsp;at all</span><span class="c0">, but at the end it&#39;s like the people over there, they really like to do that stuff. That&#39;s why it&#39;s a big industry. So that&#39;s why I realized that was the first point about the money. How it&#39;s easy to get the money. My friend told me, &quot;You know what? If you want a car, you can work a week and you can get a car.&quot; Here in Mexic</span><span>o</span><span class="c0">, you know how long you need to work </span><span>to</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;get a car? Maybe one year. Over there in the States, my friend told me, her name is Amy.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She told me once, &quot;You know what? I was having everything in the States. I was having a car, a lot of clothes, really good, everything. When I get here in Mexico, I value what is food, what is to be able to have a </span><span>hug</span><span class="c0">. I realized what is the value to be alone, what is the value for something real?&quot; Because over there everything is plastic. Everything is money, everything is superficial. When you </span><span>get</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;here in Mexico, you realize what is really important. H</span><span>ave </span><span class="c0">a house to sleep. </span><span>Have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>something</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;to eat. So that same thing is for default over there in the States.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Here in Mexico, you really </span><span>have</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the value</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>There is the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;difference</span><span>, you know,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>b</span><span class="c0">ecause you told me like, &quot;Hey, you got a BMW. You got a new BMW over there in Mexic</span><span>o</span><span class="c0">. And you&#39;re walking by yourself.&quot; And realize like, &quot;Oh yeah, </span><span>t</span><span class="c0">hat</span><span>&nbsp;was</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a </span><span>really good</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;point.&quot; So that&#39;s </span><span>why </span><span class="c0">my goal is not have </span><span>all </span><span class="c0">that stuff </span><span>&mdash;all</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the money and that stuff, because I already </span><span>had</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;it. Like I said, I already had it and was for me, it was an empty feeling. What I really want for my life is something else that I can</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;buy in anywher</span><span>e. I</span><span class="c0">n any store I can</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;buy love. In the store I can</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;buy confidence or loyalty, like I said.</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah</span><span>.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;I mean, that&#39;s a really important perspective. There have been a couple of people we&#39;ve talked to who have been like, &quot;I choose to come back to Mexico because I wanted my freedom, I wanted to be able to live my life not paranoid about the authorities or like what might happen day to day.&quot; And there&#39;s no price or value on that. That can be conversation as well as material wealth that you may have there. But then the other experiences that you can have being a citizen in Mexico as well, and traveling and that kind of thing. So that&#39;s definitely, we&#39;ve heard parts of that before, but that&#39;s put really nicely. So you plan on going back </span><span>from</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Mexico </span><span>to</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;Canada you said? What are your thoughts?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. To Toronto. Like I said, I want to </span><span>study cinematography</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>at</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;Toronto Film School. Then I just want to get back to the States as a Canadian. I need to stay over there in Toronto maybe three years, maybe get married, something. You know what my friend told me? Get married, then divorced, then go back. Okay. Why not</span><span>,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>w</span><span class="c0">hy not? It is possible, why not? </span><span>Y</span><span class="c1 c0">ou never know what&#39;s going to happen. So right now I&#39;m single. So, all right. I&#39;m like, &quot;No, I&#39;m not interested in that, but I can go and try it. Why not? &quot;</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Is there anything you&#39;d like to add or reflect on before we wrap up?</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, actually, just one thing. Like I said, the conflict hearing </span><span>of </span><span class="c0">&nbsp;other cultures is we need to help each other. These kind of programs, I really like it, because </span><span>they improve</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your life. It&#39;s really interesting because maybe like I said, I guess, like you&#39;re really an American. You have papers that you bring there. So for you, it&#39;s like your</span><span>&nbsp;daily</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;life. You don</span><span>&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;need to realize, &quot;Oh, my god. I&#39;m speaking English,&quot; or, &quot;Oh, my god. I&#39;m American. I&#39;m in the United States.&quot; So for the people, they have two cultures. They bi-cultur</span><span>al</span><span class="c1 c0">. It&#39;s really important to know this. We can learn each other. Maybe you can learn from your skills, how to really create, or build loyalty with the people that surround you.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t need to know this when someone is cheating you. That&#39;s a skill that you can learn. And as well, I learned from the States, like I said, i</span><span>s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;</span><span>being</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;organized and that stuff. So we </span><span>can learn from each</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;other. I think, at the end, we&#39;re humans. We&#39;re coming from the same place, and we&#39;re going to the same place. At the end, it&#39;s where I believe </span><span>we&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;souls, looking for the muse, like I said. I don&#39;t know how to say it. Like when you get your individual</span><span>...</span><span class="c1 c0">&nbsp;is self?</span></p><p class="c2"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. Like redo your individual truth or your own sense of self, your individuality.</span></p><p class="c2"><span class="c0">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. So then you can realize like, </span><span>o</span><span class="c1 c0">kay, well, I&#39;m a soul that has a body, not a body that has a soul.</span></p><p class="c2" id="h.gjdgxs"><span>Isabel</span><span class="c1 c0">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I really like that. I think that&#39;s perfect to end on. I like that.</span></p><p class="c2 c5"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p><div><p class="c5 c9"><span class="c1 c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
