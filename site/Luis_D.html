The way that this is going to work is that I&#39;m just going to ask you a few questions and you have to open to all you can answer me. And before I do want to acknowledge that I understand that sometimes speaking about these issues can be a little...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It can be, yes. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>And I</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;apologize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it&#39;s not a problem. We&#39;ve come here voluntarily, not because you guys, like force us or anything. But, like, I don&#39;t know. Like, I think a lot of people maybe, like, that migrate, like, in the whole world, maybe it would be maybe for most of them would be something, like kind of a little bit, like, you know, may be a little bit, in some type of way, hard to remember and to come back to all that, you know, but either way, it&#39;s all good, you know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I apologize.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, no, no, not a problem. You don&#39;t have to apologize. And matter of fact, I think that&#39;s kind of cool. I never have met you guys. I have heard about you guys, have always been wanting to talk to me in the streets. </span><span>Pero (but)</span><span class="c1">, uhm, I think that&#39;s really cool that, you know, these types of places exist or people like you guys, yeah. That&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uhm, so, the first question that I have for you is why did you or your family leave Mexico? And what was it like in the States in the beginning?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, at the beginning, when I remember that it was really like tough over there in the States, you know. It was really tough for our family, you know. &nbsp;</span><span>A</span><span class="c6">nd well we always needed someplace where to live, I guess, you know.</span><span>&nbsp;Like</span><span class="c6">, economic also reasons that we also wanted to get, like, make sure we were more stable and all that. We have, w</span><span>e have</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;brothers, sisters, and all that. My parents also have their, they had, or they have their parents as well. So, you know, it&rsquo;s like, for family reasons, you know, they wanted to go over there. We also had friends and family over there and it was like a dream for our parents to go over there and win in the States.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what was it like? What, </span><span>d</span><span class="c1">id you go to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, at first, well, we stay at home. Then after that, well, we had a school really close by, so we started going to school. We started going to school and yeah, like that. And then I started getting more used to it. Most of all, used to the States, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have any friends or teachers that you remember?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, a lot. Yeah, they actually were, like, a lot</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like who?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">of teachers. Like, maybe my, uh, elementary teacher, like wow. They were like, I didn&#39;t know I could get along so much with older people or elderly people, you know, like, instead of just teachers. Like, I got to know more, like as a personal level, on a personal level, and you know. So at first it was tough, but then it was good because, you know, we were moving up.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And so what did you get up to? What was your life like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Uh, it&#39;s pretty much going to school, helping out around the house. Uh, what else? Uh, learning more stuff, also middle school, and taking care of my family, taking care of my family, helping out my uncles, working, getting jobs, helping them out, always working. All the family... They&#39;re all like pretty much 99% of them. They&#39;re hard workers, so we&#39;re used to working.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so why did you not finish school in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the job and I think the job was... Well, what I was seeing, what was making enough money right there. You know, like, I was really a little kid and I was already getting paid a hundred dollars a day, you know, in cash. You know, so I think it&#39;s better, you know, that we, you know, I didn&#39;t have to go through all the... I know it&#39;</span><span>s not right, you know, maybe... the paperwork and all that, but I was young, you know, so suddenly get paid, you know. And yeah, getting working, you know, in the city, I appreciate all the people that always gave me, gave me work, you know, appreciate a</span><span class="c1">ll that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so did you have like a favorite job in the States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like construction. Yeah, construction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you like about construction?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez: &nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, pretty much it&#39;s rough, but I like the pay. That&#39;s the only thing I like about it. I don&#39;t like, I </span><span>don&#39;t</span><span class="c6">&nbsp;</span><span>like</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;working like an animal, but I like the pay, you know, and it&#39;s something that comes natural to us.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so how, uhm, did you end up back in Mexico? Tell me the story. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the family was actually thinking about coming back and then after all those problems. There was a lot of problems over there with migration and all that. And I just feel like a lot of people, not a lot of families, you know, which I think that in a way, you know, it kind of sucks in a way. I&#39;m not saying that a hundred percent, but in certain, uhm, certain families also, it kind of sucks. You know how the way they do some type of abuse, some people, you know. I understand how it is, you know, I understand all that politics, the laws and all. Yeah, I understand all that. And I respect that, you know. I&#39;m a person that respects each and every country here, you know, but in this case, uhm, we had to come back. This is also our home over here. And, you know, we have our house is over here. We have our family, we have our people, our culture over here. So we pretty much we always knew that we were going to come over here when we got family over there and over here.Yeah</span><span>. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so what was it like? So wait, tell me the story about you getting stopped by the police officers.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, well then that&#39;s it. I was going through with the bike. I didn&#39;t have a helmet. And then I got pulled over by some cops and they were asking me a lot of questions. They were searching me, everything. And, uhm, they&#39;re asking me a lot of questions, all that. I didn&#39;t have my papers. They took me in and they said the best thing we went with the lawyer, the best thing was the voluntary. And then we just got pretty much a bus from right there. Just crossed</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;to Juarez.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And what was it like coming back to Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At first, it kind of sucked. At first, you know,</span><span>&nbsp;at first,</span><span class="c6">it was like, what the fuck? It looked like, it </span><span>looked like,</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;a whole &#39;nother world at first, you know. At first that&#39;s when I wasn&#39;t used to it and all that. But then after that, well, after that, everything started getting much better, you know, yeah. After I started getting situated in my town, my country, and all that, things started getting much better.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was bad about it in the beginning?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it sucks sometimes, you know. Sometimes Mexico has some things. You know, it&#39;s my country and I love it, you know. I love my country, but damn, I think all the countries have something bad maybe. And then this case, Mexico, sometimes they&#39;re messing up in a couple of things, you know. But hopefully they can get things better, you know, for everybody, you know, for the whole people. Pretty much like the streets, you know, how the streets are, you know the, maybe the dogs in the streets</span><span>. Something that&#39;s not co</span><span class="c1">ol having so many dogs in the streets or maybe the pollution and all that, you know, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, uhm, what was the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, remember sometimes that within the States and maybe things were a little bit, like... It&#39;s not easier, but you had like more things available, more how you say it? Like you&#39;re more comfortable in certain things. Like you have water, you have hot water, you can go by outside right to the corner, buy something to eat. You can go to a park right away. Right here, it&rsquo;s like, you know, damn, you got to think about what you&#39;re going to do and where you&#39;re going to go and all that, you know. Like pretty much miss all that, all those things like being more comfortable, you know, like be having more options, you know. That&#39;s something good that the United States has, you know, that they actually have a lot of like, lot of things that they offer to the people in the community. So I think that&#39;s really good. That&#39;s something that Mexico needs to, needs to</span><span>, needs to</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;do, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m both, yeah. Pretty much both, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you could have stayed in the U.S., what do you think you might&#39;ve done?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I&#39;m thinking about maybe in the future about maybe going back. You know, I still think... I don&#39;t think about like it&#39;s done or it&#39;s over. Nah, I don&#39;t, we don&#39;t think of it like that because we still have people going over there, you know. We still have people all the time going over there and, you know, there&#39;s ways how they work over here, how we can get over there, you know, and so, uhm&hellip; But I want to do things the right way, you know, I want to do things the right way and be able to go over there, you know. If they want. If not, well we can go somewhere else, you know, yeah. And we also have our country.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, now that you&#39;re back in Mexico, what would you like to do? What are your dreams?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My dreams? To become rich. Yeah, that&#39;s one of my dreams. That&#39;s one of my dreams, yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c6">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, yeah, those are pretty much all the questions that I had. You answered them pretty well</span><span>, and told me. </span><span class="c1">Is there anything else that you want to add? Anything else that you want me to know?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Hernandez:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I just, I don&#39;t know. I would think I would have a lot of questions for you, but I don&#39;t want to, like, bother you with all that. I just want to, like, let you know that it&#39;s been a pleasure to meet you and that, I don&#39;t know that. I think this is kind of cool, whatever you guys do. Like, I don&#39;t know, because there&#39;s probably a lot of stories out there, you know, and that&#39;s good that you guys investigated and hopefully you guys can help out a lot of people here and over there, yeah. </span></p><p class="c0" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c1">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you. Alright, well I&#39;m just going to end it here.</span></p></body></html>
