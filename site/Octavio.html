So this is Claudia. Thank you so much for coming and speaking with us. I just first wanted to say that I understand that talking about these experiences and telling these stories can be a little difficult sometimes, because they bring up-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No worries.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... certain emotions and memories, right? That you don&#39;t necessarily want to relive or feel. But, I think it&#39;s good to note how important your story is, and how important it is for people to hear it, so that they can begin to understand the realities of migration and the human side of migration. So thank you so much for participating.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, my first question for you, is why did you decide to leave Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, like I&#39;m telling your coworker, that my plan was going to Canada, to Vancouver. Because I met a girl, and she was about to have a high school graduation, and she invite me over. But, I didn&#39;t have papers. So I had to go through the [inaudible 00:01:10].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, I&#39;m 19.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I ended up going to Lake Tahoe where I have an uncle living there, and I didn&#39;t make it to Canada. I didn&#39;t move to Canada. My uncle told me not to leave because I was a little young. But I only spent eight months in Lake Tahoe, and I went back to Los Angeles, because I had some friends from school, and from Mexico, they were already living there. So, I got in touch with them and I moved to LA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember your first day in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh well, I remember when I was crossing the border.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember the first thing that you did when you got into the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, the first thing, since we crossed the border through the beach in Tijuana. I remember just thinking, I will say the trolley, because it wasn&#39;t a train, it was a trolley, going down to downtown San Diego. I don&#39;t remember the day, and then I get to have the feeling, the atmosphere that it was totally different country. It was totally different than Mexico. Even though I&#39;m from Mexico City. You can&hellip; I remember seeing the difference, no? The way that people live in other time. I got, not surprised, I got curious because of the difference, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you learn English? What did you do in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I learned the basics in Mexico, in junior high, and that helped me a lot when I went to the States. That was a really, really good course that I had.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what did you do there? How was your life like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the States? Great (chuckle). It was very good. All the time working, and at that time when I was 19, I couldn&rsquo;t go to high school. I wanted to go to high school, but I was already old. So basically, sum my time up, I was by myself all the time was working.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were you working at?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In a lot of restaurants. I&#39;m a graduate here in Mexico as a French pastry chef, and I worked in restaurants over there all the time. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What were your favorite things to make?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I used to like to bake cakes&hellip; and basically cakes. What I did most in the restaurants, I worked most in the kitchen on a culinary side, and the service side. Because I wanted to learn.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything. I like cooking.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I like it when I make something, and people like it, enjoy it. Basically is it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how long were you in the United States for?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since 1989, til 2011.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All right, and is that all you did during that time? Just work? Or did you have like family</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I used to live with always with roommates, sometimes by myself. But I used to all the time work, eventually when I go out and met more people or something like that, I started doing salsa lessons. I did DJ on Latino clubs. I used to DJ Spanish rock, salsa, and electronic music.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Great. (chuckle)</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s your favorite thing to play?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Salsa, and electronic music. What else? I did&hellip; from some time to time I did commercials, TV commercials.

I was about to come out on the movie, Dance With Me, with Chayanne and Jessica Williams. But the filming for the extras, it was about to last two weeks, and I didn&#39;t get permission to my work, my job. But I did most commercials.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So did you meet a lot of some celebrities?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who did meet?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you can name it.

So what was your favorite thing about being in the United States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their way of living, totally different than Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what way?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money-wise.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Money-wise?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Economy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was it like to have left your family behind in Mexico to border the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it was always hard, it&#39;s hard. The things that really make me go back to Mexico was that, my family. I left all my brothers, my mother, my father.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yep. Tell me about that. How did you end up back here in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I end up here because my mother had an accident. It was like eight years before I decided to come here. And my brothers and sisters, they have their life, they married, they have a lot of stuff to do besides taking care of my mom. So, it was time for me to take care of my mother. That&#39;s basically the main, basic thing that made me move to back to Mexico City. Also my license expire at that time. So, I know I wasn&#39;t able to have a new license.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you had a license, how did you get it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get it 14 years in _____ Oregon.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even by being undocumented?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was time to still travel license without a security number at that time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, did you ever get caught by the authorities in the U.S.?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I got some tickets. I had to pay a ticket, I had a few warnings.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you came back on your own. You weren&#39;t deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you were deported one time? Tell me about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, I went to pay a traffic ticket, and I find out that I have already a warning. So, I came arrest. I couldn&#39;t pay with cash or nothing. Had to do a time. So I did, they gave me 90 days. I make three days, but I got caught by the immigration, in the county. So that&#39;s why they send me back to Mexico City. But as soon as they send me back, I went back to L.A.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long before-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Before I get back? Hours.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh really? That same day you went back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Then, you know I&#39;m always stay out of troubles, but I have a couple of tickets. That&#39;s why I get caught. But then since I got back, I pay all my tickets, all my fines, so I have to do the right thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that time that you got deported, then, when you came back permanently, you decided to come back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Mexico City. Yeah, years later, I mean, a lot of years later.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was just your decision, no police involved, no I.C.E., No, nothing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. How was that return?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard. So I didn&#39;t even want to come back.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You didn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I mean, I had to come back, basically, because my mother. I knew maybe nine years before I decided to move in. They were closing for illegal immigrants. I said, work-wise, no? Every single time I&#39;m working a restaurant or any place I always apply as an American citizen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you ever discovered?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh all the time. At the restaurants and all that they used to have the letters from the social security, with this big list that people that have the real social security number. But the owners or the managers, they used to&hellip; didn&#39;t care. (chuckle) That&#39;s a good thing, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So, what&#39;s been the hardest part about being back in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s been seven years since I got back, and I haven&#39;t got on my feet yet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What have you been up to here? </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I work in a little restaurants, I opened my own business, I close down. That&#39;s a lot of stuff I closed down because they want me to pay, let&#39;s say rent.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was your business?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a pizzeria, pizza parlor.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How long did you have it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c8">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a year and a half. I was doing okay, but I had to close it down, because like I told you, they want me for me to pay rent, you know? I mean, I used to pay rent legally. I have my business legally, but the </span><span class="c8 c10">chicos</span><span class="c8">&nbsp;</span><span class="c8 c10">malos</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;wanted for me to pay them rent so I can be safe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you feel safe in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, but until that time, so I had to close down. I didn&#39;t want to pay any money as a security, no? You know what I mean, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I decided to close down, and then I opened the business in Los Cabos, and then I closed down because of that. Then I came to Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What has it been like to see your family again?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s alright. I mean, it&#39;s always great being around your family, but I still miss there, the way I used to live in LA.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So. what are you up to now?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Now, I&#39;m working here and there, and I have maybe an opportunity to go overseas. I was working on it right now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To Armenia.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh really? To do what?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A Mexican place.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open a Mexican restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To open a Mexican restaurant in Armenia, wow that&#39;s crazy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With a friend of mine, maybe, maybe.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome. That would be really cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the meantime, you know, we&#39;re here and there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still working on restaurants?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, from time to time, and I work from my home.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Have you ever been discriminated against for being a returning migrant in Mexico?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Believe it or not, yes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I believe it. Tell me a little bit more about it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;People look at you like you... people who don&rsquo;t know how it works. They think you left Mexico because you hate Mexico. No. On the first place. So, when you come back, the way I did was like... they make you think that you are a loser, no? A failure, but it&#39;s totally the opposite, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, working over there, learning stuff over there, I mean, it&#39;s different than working over here, and people feel threatened. I mean, threatened? Because you have more experience, you do stuff more easily. You got more choices, but still no, people want to put you down, because you speak English better than people that have courses, expensive certificates, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, a lot of people that we talk to sometimes say that here in Mexico, people just want to shut you down. They&#39;re very competitive, especially when you come from the States. Whereas in the States, people try to help you, and be good Samaritans or&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right here, I mean, they&#39;re still good, but the people really, really sometimes discriminate, in that way. I mean, and it&#39;s hard feeling that here in your country, to be honest, I never feel discriminated in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you leave any family behind in the States when you came back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it&#39;s funny. It&#39;s a good question because I have a daughter, she&#39;s 16. But I find out when she was 10 years old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, you didn&#39;t know about her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I didn&#39;t know. Her mother found me on Facebook, and she told me the news when she was already 10.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hard. It&#39;s hard because one of the things that made me move back to Mexico City is that I accomplished a lot of stuff over there in the States, but I was by myself at the time. I&#39;m always feel, it got to a point where I feel empty, and I was thinking, I miss my family. I miss my family. I get back to Mexico City, I hug my mom and all that. I hang with my brothers, my sisters. The love is there, right? They don&#39;t, they don&#39;t care, no? They love you anyways. But I still feel empty.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then a year, a year and a half later I found out that I have a daughter. So, I ended up with the conclusion that was my emptiness, no? You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s what you wanted.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, I didn&#39;t know how my daughter and she was already 10 when I find out.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I put the time together when I start feeling that way, and it started. The feeling starts basically when she born, which I didn&#39;t know. I brought her.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you&#39;ve never met her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Through pictures, her mom sent me pictures. But she hasn&#39;t tell her, my daughter, that her real father is me, not the guy she grew up with.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you&#39;ve never spoken to her?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I left that to God. No? She told me because she went to these, a new religion. One of those religions that make you clear all the things of yourself. Basically that&#39;s what she told me. And I didn&#39;t pressure, nothing. I just, I only told her that I leave that to God, whatever she wanted to tell her, beyond, I&#39;ll be right here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you still get pictures?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, every couple of months, sometimes every month, every three months, every six months. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s her name?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Caroline. Carolina.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Carolina. Where in the States?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s in _____.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Oregon?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s where we bake the muffin. That I didn&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, do you consider yourself Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I consider myself both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, there&#39;s a saying that we always hear that says from migrants who come back, that it&#39;s, &quot;We&#39;re neither here nor from there.&quot; What do you think about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, it depends on how we say in Mexico is the [foreign language 00:20:41]. I mean, to me, it&#39;s like, I only had good things from the States. When I left Mexico, I was 19. I was under my mother and my father wing, so everything was fine, no? I left because I decided to go. But because of this girl that I met, no? But I feel Mexican, and from the U.S. I don&#39;t feel like I&#39;m not from here, I&#39;m from there. Legally or not from there, legally I&#39;m from here. But my heart is in the States, and most because my daughter is over there. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In what ways do you think that the United States has shaped where you are today?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I grew up in the States basically. Well, I leave my childhood here, I become a man in the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;If you could have stayed in the U.S., what do you think you would have done?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had the opportunity to work on my paperwork, no? Over there. But I wanted to come back because my family and my mother, so I didn&#39;t take it that way. I had the money to fix out all that. But, I decided to come back. That&#39;s what I would&#39;ve done, fix all my status, and then come back. But I didn&#39;t think it that way.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think you&#39;re going to go back someday?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I have a lot of friends, families that I met through the years over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And your daughter.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My daughter basically, no?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I know you&#39;ve been back here eight-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven years.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seven and a half.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, now that you&#39;ve been back here, what do you think you&#39;d like to do? What are your dreams and your goals?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my dreams right now are take a certification course for English, which I never took in the States. I should&#39;ve done that, too. Have my own business.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your business being?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Restaurant.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of restaurant?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was thinking most like American, Mexican, a little bit of everything. Not too much, but always with a salsa band, live salsa band.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, definitely let me know when you open it, and I&#39;ll come back to visit it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You got it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, these next few questions are more reflective-based. So, what do you think that the Mexican government can do to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They can do a lot, they didn&#39;t do nothing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s one thing you think they should do?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To reunite the families?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To help Mexican migrants-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not to go over there?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... reintegrate when they back?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Reintegrate? One thing that I think, this won&#39;t happen, if you get good salary. You know? I think that&rsquo;s the&hellip; from that, it will be totally different. People don&#39;t go to States. I didn&#39;t go because of the economy, when my family didn&#39;t have that much, while I used to have what I need. Don&#39;t take me wrong, my family is not rich, or nothing, no? But I didn&#39;t have the need for me to go to States because to make money. But when I was there, I noticed the difference, right? But I know a lot of people go because of the money. Because of low salary, low opportunities, no? That&#39;s the first thing came to my mind. If Mexico have a good salary, and they really care about the employees, about the citizens in Mexico, people won&#39;t go anywhere. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what I think. That&#39;s my point of view.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the United States government do to help Mexican deportees, and also the families that they leave?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To me, to be honest, they don&rsquo;t have to do nothing. Right? But also, being there, they can also help people over there. The people that stay over there already, no? Because at some point they always get benefits from the illegals, immigrants, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because just, just telling you this, that there&#39;s a lot of people that don&#39;t do their income tax, a lot of illegal immigrants. And then always, when you get your paycheck, you always got your taxes deducted. So, where all that money is ,no? That people got never the income tax until now, because they got afraid of doing an income tax and get caught through immigration because of that. So, where all the money is? That&#39;s why I&#39;m point. It&#39;s a lot. Like in Mexico, like me, I&#39;m in Mexico. I don&#39;t think there&#39;s something that the United States need to do. For me, it has nothing to do with that, no? United States doesn&rsquo;t have to do anything, just because I live over there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I don&#39;t know how much interaction you had with gangs in the United States, but I&#39;m curious what you have your opinion of why young, Mexican men in the United States turn towards crime and gangs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they&#39;re stupid. I mean, I have a lot of friends over there, they were Mexican Americans. They were members of, of a gang. They decided to go deeper there. But I don&#39;t know, I think it&#39;s an easy way out. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I guess in talking about what happened with your business, and the people who were trying to get you to pay them, which I&#39;m assuming were some sort of organized criminals.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah they were organized criminals, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What can the Mexican government do to prevent returning migrants from turning to crime and gangs when they come back to Mexico? Or from falling into that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The main thing, is get rid of the corruption. That&#39;s it. Being a country free of corruption, it would be a different country. Right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). Okay. So those were all the questions that I had. But now I want to give you the space to add anything. Anything else that you would like to say. It can be whatever you want, something that you feel like I should know, or that you didn&#39;t tell me, or that you want to clarify, or something that you want to add on to. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nah, maybe just that I miss the States.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What do you miss the most about it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Everything. Yeah, for me, thank God, I didn&#39;t have any bad experience. I never ran into a gang. I&#39;m just work and try to be a decent citizen. There&#39;s no, I mean, I didn&#39;t have the problems most of the guys got deported from, no? I could&#39;ve done things different. I could&#39;ve fix my papers right away, as soon as I can. I couldn&#39;t make it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you satisfied with everything that you&#39;ve told me?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s fine.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool, well, thank you so much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Octavio:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No problem.</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Claudia:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, thank you.</span></p><p class="c1 c14"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c14 c17"><span class="c0"></span></p><a id="t.58fae85fc1d07e1493d51db806e6dac2eec81174"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c4"><tbody><tr class="c15"><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c6"><span class="c0"></span></p></div></body></html>
