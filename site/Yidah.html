He left first because he was following his mom, who always went to California. Sorry, I get long winded. My grandma left first to start a new life in California. Then my dad followed her. And then my mom&hellip; They were 16, both of them, my parents. She waited until she finished high school. Then she took me with her. First, she sent me. It was a whole thing. It created abandonment issues with my parents. I remember not knowing who my dad was, and then all of a sudden, my mom was gone, and I&#39;m with this guy that I don&#39;t really know, even though he&#39;s my dad. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because he left when I was really young.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Especially for such a young age, so many new faces. You just need one consistent face.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember they told me all the time how when he was gone, in that timeline he was gone, and I was here with my mom, they would ask me, &quot;Where&#39;s your dad?&quot; I was like, &quot;No dad.&quot; Well, in Spanish like, &quot;No, no. No Dad. </span><span class="c2 c3">No existe</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;[He doesn&rsquo;t exist].&rdquo; I was just in denial that I had a father. Then they sent me to the US with my grandma. She came to pick me up.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you cross the border?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Back then it was really easy. I was just a baby. A child in the backseat, they don&#39;t even look at you, not back then. They were just like, &quot;Okay, you have a kid. Go.&quot; We just drove across the border. I was living with my dad for a while. Then it was the whole thing like, &quot;I don&#39;t even know who you are. Where&#39;s my mom? I miss her.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was two and a half. I was just like, &quot;Where&#39;s my mom? I miss my mom.&quot; I was crying all the time. &quot;Where&#39;s my family? Who are you?&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;I&#39;m your father.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I don&#39;t know. Are you?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[crosstalk 00:01:52].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then they joined and we were good. It was just that initial trauma.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, absolutely. Then growing up, do you mind talking about what was school like, what was ESL like, that kind of thing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because it was such a Mexican community, the city I grew up in, it was actually not that confusing for me. Everyone was Mexican and most of them were illegal immigrants. </span><span>And the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;first two years of Kinder and first grade, it was in Spanish. Actually, they transferred me to the English classes because I wasn&#39;t learning English. They weren&#39;t really trying to teach me English. They were just trying to accommodate to my Spanish speaking, which it&#39;s cool, but come on. I need to learn English. Then they transferred me to English-speaking classes. That&#39;s when I actually learned English, but first I learned to read in Spanish even though it was the US. They were really accommodating. That&#39;s nice. The school was very Mexican oriented.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just did grow up with that fear of, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s the cops. Look out,&quot; because my mom didn&#39;t have a license, but that does make you a better person, just knowing the speed limit is something you have to follow, not just because it&#39;s the law, but because you&#39;re going to get deported if you don&#39;t. It really just makes you a law-abiding citizen, so that&#39;s good. People always say that we&#39;re the rule breakers, right? It&#39;s like we&#39;re the most law-abiding ones. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;With anything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because if anyone gets stopped by a cop, it&#39;s just, &quot;Whatever. Oh well,&quot; but with us, we follow the rules, or we go get deported. Come on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was one thing. Coming from my own privilege, having the citizenship, not having to really worry if a cop pulled me over that your whole life was going to &ndash;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, that&#39;s something I had to wrap my head around, talking to people my age who were just like, &quot;Yeah, I was just driving without a license, didn&#39;t do anything wrong. They pulled me over because they saw what I looked like.&quot; Obviously, in the country right now&hellip; As soon as I forget to put my license in my car, I think about it. That&#39;s such a privilege to just not have to worry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, not have to think about it, exactly. Here, I have that privilege because I&#39;m Mexican, and it&#39;s nice. It&#39;s nice to not have to be so paranoid all the time.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>So then</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;rewind back to school. Did you like school? Did you have any teachers? What was it like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I was a great student. I was in all honors. Teachers loved me. I mean, I was kind of a rebel, but that&#39;s part of the... They liked it because they&#39;re like, &quot;You question everything.&quot; They were very encouraging.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;An intellectual rebel.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they were very encouraging. My school was for nerds. It&#39;s not like that either, but it was all about your grades. You got kicked out if you didn&#39;t turn in your homework. You didn&#39;t get bullied if, &quot;Oh, you&#39;re doing well.&quot; You know how that happens a lot?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Is this a public school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, yes, but it was a...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Charter?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They&#39;re called fundamental schools. </span><span>So it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;kind of like special. You take an entrance exam. It&#39;s really regulated. Not just everyone gets in.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But the majority of your school was from your community, Mexican descent?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but they were really whitewashed. That sounds weird, but...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no. Please go into that. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not like there was a lot of Mexican mentality going on. I grew up around not a lot of sexism and not a lot of... Just none of that, I don&#39;t know, background. They were very Americanized very quickly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was that like the majority of your community around your house or did it vary in terms of the caliber of student and everything that you lived near? Does that make sense?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It doesn&#39;t, but I think I follow [laughs]</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can make it really clear. A lot of people I talk to have lived in communities with a lot of danger, a lot of youth especially that join gangs and stuff. </span><span>And so like, they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;don&#39;t go to school and stuff. I was wondering is the community you were in mostly going to this school you&#39;re talking about or was it a mix?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I lived in the poor side of the town. Just I was lucky enough to get into this school on the other side of town. Where I lived, there was more danger. It wasn&#39;t even that dangerous. I think people were just picky. I don&#39;t know. I really didn&#39;t feel that unsafe because it was full of Mexicans, yes, but it&#39;s not like they were going to hurt me. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyways, but all my friends from school were all like, &quot;Oh, we&#39;re not going there. That&#39;s ghetto. We&#39;re not going to go to your house.&rdquo; I&#39;m like, &quot;Okay, whatever. I mean, I walk home every day, but I guess that&#39;s dangerous.&quot; I don&#39;t know. I mean, it&#39;s Orange County. Ghetto in Orange County doesn&#39;t really mean the ghetto.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s not like some of the other&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. It&#39;s not like the dangerous areas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, because we talk to a variety of people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. It wasn&#39;t like gang members and shootings, nothing like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was more just like the stereotypes that kind of follow?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. Mexicans living there. Slightly poorer than everywhere else, it doesn&#39;t mean a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of what you mentioned, where it&#39;s just like actually, one could say we&#39;re going to be the most safe over here because we&#39;re following the law to such a T.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, yeah. I mean, I was Mexican, they were Mexican. My neighbors were. We all knew each other. It was really not that bad at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you said you grew up with that paranoia from your parents always like, &quot;Be careful. We can&#39;t do the same things that other kids do,&quot; that kind of thing, did that ever put a strain on any friendships you had at school or were a lot of people in school also undocumented?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, it was kind of cool to be undocumented like, &quot;Ah, you&#39;re so authentic. You&#39;re such a real Mexican.&quot; It was a lot of Mexican pride going on, but it was like, &quot;Dude, you&#39;re so whitewashed. You don&#39;t even know what being Mexican is.&quot; I don&#39;t know. It was kind of weird, but everyone was so proud of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;d say that to them, or they&#39;d say that to you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, to them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&rsquo;s really interesting and super valid to have used the term whitewashed in that context, but do you mind just unpacking w</span><span>hat you think,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;your understanding of it in that context?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean, there&#39;s a lot of sexism involved with being Mexican. People don&#39;t realize. There&#39;s a lot of poverty involved with being Mexican. There&#39;s a lot of discrimination and Catholicism, a lot of that stuff. They weren&#39;t like that at all. They grew up with a very American train of thought. It&#39;s just like if you haven&#39;t experienced a man whistling at you with vulgarities in Spanish, you&#39;re not Mexican. It&#39;s just like that. I don&#39;t know. They have all this Mexican pride, like, &quot;Yeah, Mexican.&quot; And like, &quot;Dude, there&#39;s a reason you&#39;re not there. I&#39;m sorry. Maybe you&#39;re proud of your heritage, but you can&#39;t be like I&#39;m a proud Mexican. You&#39;ve never even been. You go once a year maybe. You don&#39;t know what it&#39;s like to actually have to live in that condition.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Kind of just like picking the parts of it that you could enjoy from it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. They were raised in privilege. Like I said, they&rsquo;re whitewashed. They were raised with money. Their parents were successful. It&#39;s just like, &quot;You don&#39;t understand. You were raised as a white person, but you&#39;re Mexican. It&#39;s different. I mean, I respect your heritage, but you can&#39;t act like you have that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, living that experience versus having that experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like white people, they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh yeah, I&#39;m German. I have this German background and I&#39;m so German.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;But are you?&rdquo; No one says that because they know that&#39;s not real, so it&#39;s the same concept for me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My mom&#39;s from Portugal. My grandparents emigrated. They were peasants and had to leave for economic reasons. I&#39;m always like, &quot;Yeah, I&#39;m half Portuguese,&quot; and I love my Portuguese identity, but I don&#39;t live that experience.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;All Portuguese pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I come from great privilege. I never had to do the factory shifts that my grandparents did or-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Survive under an oppressive regime.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was never my experience. I don&#39;t identify in ways that that would benefit me because I live a life of privilege without that, but I still feel connected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, of course.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But there&#39;s that line.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were a little too over the top with it. I was like, &quot;I&#39;m actually an illegal immigrant, so I live in fear every day,&rdquo; and they&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, that&#39;s so cool. Genuine suffering.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Romanticizing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It was very, very romanticized in my school, and I think that&#39;s part of what made me not take it seriously. I didn&#39;t realize really, really the danger until I got deported. I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude. I&#39;m gone. That wasn&#39;t my home any... I&#39;m just lost.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It would literally be like anyone who grew up essentially American.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They raised you like, &quot;Our history.&quot; You know how in school they use words like that, our history, our this, our that, and it just makes you think that. Then you watch American TV, you actually think... I don&#39;t know. The US is very self centered. You don&#39;t even realize that until you leave it, and then you&#39;re like, &quot;Wow, what the hell was I thinking? That&#39;s not even my home. They&#39;re not even my people. Why did I let them make me think that?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You felt, in reflection, almost brain washed by living in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really interesting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because, like I said, it was a very whitewashed area. I didn&#39;t realize that had happened to me, that they had made me think that I was a part of them and that I was an American.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So growing up, you didn&#39;t have this perspective, did you feel proud to be an American or did you always have a sort of dynamic with it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was like the whole, &quot;I&#39;m a proud Mexican.&quot; I was also in the whole spiel of that romanticism, &quot;I&#39;m an illegal immigrant. I&#39;m Mexican, but really I think I&#39;m an American.&quot; Really I think there&#39;s layers to it. I don&#39;t know how to explain it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Also, the historical layers where it&#39;s like... Especially, in California, we&#39;re talking about land that was actually just taken that would have been in Mexico if there wasn&#39;t colonization.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, there&#39;s that too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There&#39;s a lot of different avenues.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I guess I just felt like it was my country subconsciously. I didn&#39;t realize I felt that way, but then when I came here, I realized that I felt rejected by the country that had told me I was welcome. I didn&#39;t realize I felt that way until I did get rejected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think framing deportation as a rejection like, &quot;It is personal, that was my home.&quot; Then the easiest way for, I think, the US people to come to terms with it is, &quot;Oh no, it&#39;s just a legal matter. Here are the documents. Here are the documents.&quot; &quot;No, this is a young woman who grew up here and identified here and has family and friends here. You&#39;re actually taking away part of her life when you do that&rdquo; and it&#39;s not just, &quot;Here&#39;s the paperwork,&quot; like crisp and clean like that. It&#39;s really, really messy when it comes down to it. Do you mind going into what led to your deportation and how that came to be?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I was 16. And I was just kinda like, you know that rebellious spirit you get, that whole?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were just being a kid, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I ran away from home&hellip; Sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re fine. No, no, it</span><span>&rsquo;s like </span><span class="c0">trust me when I say we&#39;ve heard such a spectrum.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know, I know. I ran away from home because... I don&#39;t know. There&#39;s a lot of reasons. My parents... It&#39;s hard raising a kid when you&#39;re that young. I understand.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How young were they?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were 16 when they had me, so they were in their early 20s. My mom was very religious. I felt stifled. My dad did not know how to be a father. I just felt trapped and lost. You know, teenage angst. Teenage angst.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m getting a long of angst. It sounds also really valid. Your parents were young and especially if there was a religious component when you were a teenager.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I just found out I was bisexual. It just conflicted with my parents&rsquo;... Well, my mom&#39;s religious beliefs. I couldn&#39;t face that. </span><span>I mean she</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;freaked out when she found out I wasn&#39;t a virgin anymore. Freaked out. It was just like, &ldquo;I can&#39;t even tell you the rest.&rdquo; I just couldn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s such a weight to hold.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my God, yeah. She freaked out, freaked out, freaked out like I was going to die or something. I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude. It&#39;s not that big of a deal.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right because that&#39;s what she knows.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And I&#39;m like, &quot;I can&rsquo;t even go into the rest. I&#39;m just out. I don&#39;t have your understanding.&rdquo; I don&#39;t have my father&#39;s attention at all, absent father type of thing. It&#39;s like, &quot;I can&#39;t.&quot; So, I left. I left with my girlfriend at the time because she also had very, very bad living conditions. Her parents were just... That&#39;s a whole other thing. </span><span>But so we were</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;really connected, and we ran away together at 16. We were homeless for about a week in Las Vegas. It sounds a lot harder than... It has so much impact to say things like, &quot;We were homeless,&quot; but it doesn&#39;t really... It&#39;s Las Vegas. It&#39;s really nice.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure you&#39;ve been. It&#39;s really nice. The only problem is that people kept asking us, &quot;Where are your parents?&quot; We were like, &quot;They&#39;re in a hotel. Don&#39;t worry. We&#39;re good.&quot; You know? &quot;We just want to hang around.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s still I mean...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s still something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s still an intensive space for any 16-year-old.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Honestly, the hardest times was I was thinking logically. I&#39;m like, &quot;Oh okay, living homeless is scary because of nighttime.&quot; So, Las Vegas sounds great because nighttime is the life time. Ironically, the daytime was the hardest time because it was empty and so hot. It was so sunny. It was a ghost town. Everyone&#39;s asleep, but there&#39;s just cops out. They were like, &quot;What are you guys doing out in the middle of the day?&quot; We were like, &quot;Oh nothing. Just walking around.&quot; It was really awkward, 16-year-olds.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In Las Vegas?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s kind of weird. We couldn&#39;t stay there for long. It wasn&#39;t a horrible experience. It wasn&#39;t a great experience. It was an experience that... I don&#39;t know. I think a part of it also, I wanted to suffer because you know how... Like I said, there&#39;s all this Mexican pride, but you don&#39;t even know what real suffering is. I think I felt like, &quot;If I haven&#39;t suffered, then what have I done with my life?&quot; I know that&#39;s a weird logic, but you get what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I didn&#39;t suffer. I got given money just because I was a girl, and I was little. They&#39;re like, &quot;Oh, this poor thing.&quot; I mean, thank you world. Thank you, strangers, because dude, that&#39;s great, but I don&#39;t know. Anyways, because as I said, during the day, people kept staring at us and it was a little fishy, so we had to leave, we took a bus to Arizona. I don&#39;t know what the logic was there. </span><span>And that&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;when I got stopped because in Arizona, it was more controlling illegal immigrants and stuff. So they stopped us. Teenage stupidity, we were carrying drugs.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I really don</span><span>&rsquo;t&hellip; </span><span class="c0">It was just pills and weed, but it was a lot of it. See, in my mind, it was like, &quot;I&#39;ll stockpile because you&#39;re going to need it.&quot; I wasn&#39;t going to smoke it all in one go. I wasn&#39;t going to do it all in one go. Which I know drugs are bad, whatever, but the point is I wasn&#39;t going to do all that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Weed is so normalized. That&#39;s why I think it&#39;s important to draw the distinction. You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. </span><span>But like the</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;point is I wasn&#39;t going to... I wasn&rsquo;t that far gone, but the point is it was a lot.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were crossing state lines?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm. They thought I was dealing drugs. I also had money with me because you don&#39;t run away without money. Come on. I mean, people do, but I tried not to. I tried to be able to do things for myself. I had money on me and I had the stash of all this product. </span><span>And they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;thought that I was selling. I mean, that makes sense. Honestly, logically, yeah. I see what they mean.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They were trying to put the pieces together. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, they thought I was dealing. I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m not,&quot; but it seemed like it was a lot bigger deal than it was. </span><span>So they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;arrested me. She actually... She&#39;s a legal citizen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your girlfriend&#39;s also-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my ex.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh sorry. Was she also your age?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;16.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She was a legal citizen. She was born there, and so she went to court and stuff, but I got deported. Two years later, she came to live with me over here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So that&#39;s how they ended up deporting you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Then she was also deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. She just, she</span><span>&rsquo;</span><span class="c0">s American. She was born there, but Mexican descent. She came to live with me at 18. I still live with her. It&#39;s just, we&#39;re not together anymore.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh that&#39;s why you said [crosstalk 00:18:49]?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It&#39;s just I don&#39;t how to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s complicated.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. It</span><span>&rsquo;s just, w</span><span class="c0">e&#39;ve had our backs for so long. I&#39;ve known her since middle school. It&#39;s just beyond anything. It&#39;s not friends. It&#39;s not this, it&#39;s not that. It&#39;s just sisters at this point.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Beyond that even. We&#39;ve also been together so you can&#39;t say sisters. That&#39;s kind of creepy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You know what I mean?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I see that aspect of it, but I also get the sense that you just have always had each other&#39;s backs. Soul sort of connection there. Yeah, absolutely. Do you mind then... After you were deported&ndash; </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, like I said, substance abuse and just depression. I live with my family, who&#39;s so, so, so religious.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a bit about that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. My mom is religious, but she has a little bit of Americanized in her, but here, no. In Mexico, living with that mentality.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexico City?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, in the state of Mexico. It&#39;s a little bit outside the border of the city. You know Jehovah&#39;s Witnesses?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative).</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s what they are. It&#39;s very intense, very strict. Every day. I actually got emotionally harassed a lot by my uncle. You know how here it&#39;s like you can&#39;t talk back to a man for some reason?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s ridiculous. He would make me cry so much and nobody would stand up for me. That really hurt. They would just see him torturing me like that, like, &quot;You think you&#39;re a guy because you dress like a guy.&quot; I dress like a person. It&#39;s not even butch. I mean obviously there&#39;s nothing wrong with that either, but it&#39;s not even like it was that far. Even then, it was like, &quot;What? You think you&#39;re a guy now?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;No. I wear makeup. I do my hair. I don&#39;t understand.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just harassing you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously, and I would have pictures of... In my head, it was pictures of my idols, people I... women I idolize, women I looked up to.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Joan Jett, Kristen Stewart, just women who I thought were strong. Mostly just them. No, other women, but I forgot. He&#39;s like, &quot;Your wall just looks like you&#39;re gay.&quot; Not what I was going for. It&#39;s not like a sexual thing. I look up to them. Should I have pictures of guys up and be like... I don&#39;t know. Wouldn&#39;t it be better if I look up to someone as opposed to being perverted about someone? But whatever. Just think what you want to think. But it hurt a lot. It was my development years. That was 16 to 18. It was just horrible.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then here I went to a high school that was for people who weren&#39;t able to go to school, so it was mostly with adults. I was a 16-year-old with people above 18, in their 30s. Grownups, but also uneducated because it&#39;s a makeup high school. I got into a lot of bad influences. They gave me drugs. I didn&#39;t even know what they were. I took whatever they gave me. I was really in a really bad spot. </span><span>And I mean who</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;does that? If you&#39;re 30 something and you&#39;re giving this to a 16-year-old, who has no idea what they&#39;re-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Who&#39;s also being... If you&#39;re being emotionally harassed in your home, you&#39;re looking for some sort of outlet to give you any sort of comfort.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. It&#39;s really like, &quot;Dang, they were bad people really.&quot; Who does that? I remember one guy who got really mad at me because I </span><span>didn&rsquo;t want to</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have sex with him. I&#39;m like, &quot;You&#39;re as old as my dad.&quot; He&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, let that go. Age is just a number.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Ugh!&quot; There&#39;s so much sexism.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Horrible. That&#39;s so creepy.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So much sexism. Their outreach, you don&#39;t want that. It&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, it&#39;s my fault.&quot; Something&#39;s wrong with you. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the culture always says like make sure you&#39;re really polite. You don&#39;t want to do anything because you&rsquo;re a woman. Keep in your little lane.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was honestly like... That&#39;s why I say adaption to a whole different culture. My mind did not understand all the sexism. At home too, like, &quot;Serve your uncle.&quot; Or my aunts. They both worked hard, my uncle and my aunt, but it&#39;s like, &quot;</span><span class="c3 c2">Ah, s&iacute;rvela</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c3 c2">tu hermano</span><span class="c2">&quot; Sorry, that&#39;s Spanish, but, &quot;Serve your brother food.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Why? Why would you do that?&quot; Then my grandpa, &quot;Give me more beans.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Huh?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so rude.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s not just men. It&#39;s also age too because priority of age and then priority of sex. So, an old man, you have to do everything for him. I resented that because it&#39;s like, &quot;What? But he&#39;s an ass to me.&rdquo; He&#39;s always telling me stuff about my beliefs, about my character, about how he wishes I was like... &quot;I remember when you were a little girl. You were so sweet.&quot; Acting like it was a sweet thing, but it&#39;s like, &quot;No, you&#39;re not being nice to me. You&#39;re being an asshole. You&#39;re not happy with who I am. That&#39;s not cool.&quot; Why would I be nice to them like that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I just didn&#39;t understand any of it. It was so illogical, and the way men treat you, the way everyone looks at you. A woman who likes rock, that was even weird. Come on. I mean, it all made no sense to me. </span><span>It was just</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;drugs, and that influence. It wasn&#39;t until I was 18 and moved in with my girlfriend that I really started to finally come to be myself again, being out of that toxic environment with someone who understood me. Just actually making my own life and knowing that I had to do something for myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when I actually started... That&#39;s when I became an English teacher. I found purpose in life. I thought, &quot;This is great to teach someone,&quot; but it didn&#39;t pay a lot. It paid very, very little. It was all day. I did that for a year. I enjoyed it a lot, but I couldn&#39;t monetarily keep doing it, so then I worked at a call center, which paid well, but it was soul draining because there was no purpose in it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I&#39;ve heard the people can be awful.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Actually, I was really lucky. I&#39;m very picky. I have high standards for my life because I think I should. I never went to a call center that treated you like that. It was always with professionals. I actually worked at a call center that worked with 7/11s. </span><span>So the</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;employees would call you, &quot;Hey, my Slurpee machine broke.&quot; You would call the technician&#39;s who&#39;s also a professional, &quot;Hey, can you go get the...&rdquo; Every now and then, they were just frustrated like, &quot;Why isn&#39;t he here yet?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry ma&#39;am. I&#39;ll make sure. I&#39;ll contact him.&quot; You do it. </span><span>It&rsquo;s just you&rsquo;re</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;not trying to scam someone. You&#39;re not trying to sell something. You&#39;re not trying to talk to a customer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, those are really where people...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, and I didn&#39;t want that even though those paid more. I was like, &quot;No.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s good to know also what you need for your own mental health and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. I feel like I&#39;m always... I try to do that for myself. Sometimes I forget, but you try your best.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then you also became a makeup artist for a bit?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, after that...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have an interest in that in the US or is this something you developed?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, actually I didn&#39;t wear makeup at all. My mom was that kind of person. She&#39;s like, &quot;No makeup. Women have to be natural.&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;It makes me happy.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a form of expression.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. I went into that. </span><span>And there</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;I experienced a lot of racism. I was the brownest person in class. There&#39;s a lot of white Mexicans. Usually, they&#39;re the ones with more money. It was an expensive school in an expensive area, and there was a lot of racism. Just they looked down on me. Also, people have a lot of... That&#39;s where I experienced a lot of that whole deportee thing. They look down on you for that. </span><span>And that&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;weird. Why? I don&#39;t get that either.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How in the specific interactions, could you characterize that? Looking down on you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like the normal... </span><span>I mean who</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;gets deported or who goes to the US? Poor people. They&#39;re upper class. It&#39;s that classism thing. It wasn&#39;t so much... Yeah, classism because racism here is more classism. When you&#39;re dark, it&#39;s because people assume you&#39;re poor. They look down on you like you&#39;re less than. I&#39;m like, &quot;I&#39;m more educated than you, but okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, always having to swallow your pride a bit.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but whatever. </span><span>And it&rsquo;s</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;a lot of that unearned confidence that you get a lot with people who are still privileged, but that was a nice experience. I learned a lot. Then I came here.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How did you find out about HolaCode?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in New Comienzos. They were doing a course for interpreting. I think they were actually there for that. I learned the interpreting thing and then Lenny, who&#39;s the recruiter from New Comienzos, for HolaCode. She talked to me about it. I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude, education, I&#39;ll do anything.&quot; I studied languages here. I studied anything I could get my hand on. I like to learn. I felt like crap. I had my high school diploma. At least I got it here, but it&#39;s not the same. You know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you wanted to...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I did whatever I could. I&#39;m like, &quot;Education? Yes, sign me up.&quot; I didn&#39;t even have to ask twice. So</span><span>, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I forgot what I was going to say. Between the call center and the school was when I started my own business because I was like, &quot;I don&#39;t want to work at a call center my whole life.&quot; It&#39;s draining for my soul. Because you&#39;re sitting there doing nothing. You&#39;re wasting your life away. So, I started my own business. I&#39;m like, &quot;What can I do? I can sell stuff I have.&quot; I have a few things here and there that I might not need, might not use.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I sold them. Turns out people want to buy stuff and stuff you don&#39;t expect. I actually sell wigs and corsets. That&#39;s my best-selling stuff.</span><span>&nbsp;Yeah, i</span><span class="c0">t&#39;s so random, right? Back then, there was no competition, so I started selling them. I asked my dad for some money for my birthday. I&#39;m like, &quot;I don&#39;t want a present. I want $100 to buy some products and start my own thing, get the ball rolling.&quot; I did. I got my first shipment. I remember I was so excited posting my ads. Actually got questions. Actually got sales. It was just invigorating to do your own thing. That&#39;s when I quit my job at the call center and it just felt great to be able to do things for myself. Then you have free time to do what you want.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Where do you feel like that entrepreneurial instinct came from?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just the need to survive. If I feel like I&#39;m dying, I leave. In this case... Usually, that&#39;s running away, but you can&#39;t run away from everything. So what can you do to fix it? It&#39;s like, &quot;[inaudible 00:28:16] I got to do something about it.&quot; It&#39;s like how they say, you don&#39;t know how strong you are until you have to be strong. It&#39;s like, &quot;I can&#39;t keep dying at the call center emotionally.&quot; I don&#39;t care that&#39;s what everyone else does. It&#39;s not what&#39;s right for me. Like I said, I have high standards for my own life. I just feel like I deserve that for myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s incredible. I mean, especially incredible when... I&#39;d grown up in a place where my parents were like, &quot;Anything you want, you pursue it. We have your back,&quot; and all that stuff. For you, you had to be that own voice for yourself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. I mean, my girlfriend was very supportive. She was that voice for me too. Like I said, we have each other&#39;s back all the time. </span><span>So, it</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;just feels great to have support.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so important.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It is.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Even just one other voice that says, &quot;Hey, what you&#39;re saying is right and it&#39;s okay.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your feelings are valid, and it doesn&#39;t matter that the world is against you. I&#39;m with you. I just feel everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really what it takes.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That describes the relationship better I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s also hard to put a label on those things so much.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s just everything.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How do you feel where you are now in life? What do you hope to do from here?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>I mean h</span><span class="c0">onestly, the possibilities are endless. I get this interview question a lot. I really have to practice because they always say, &quot;Where do you see yourself in a year?&quot; I&#39;m like, &quot;Dude, if I did that, I would be limiting myself. I see myself successful. I see myself doing great things, but what? You tell me. You&#39;re the one that&#39;s going to hire me. You&#39;re going to tell me what to do, but I&#39;m going to rock it. It doesn&#39;t matter what you put me to do. That&#39;s what I just want them to get.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like, &quot;Wherever I put my drive is going to be incredible.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. I really put my heart in everything I do. That&#39;s something I&#39;m proud of. It doesn&#39;t matter what I decide to do. I do want to keep being a makeup artist. I love it, freelancing. I also want something that&#39;s intellectually challenging though, so coding. I love it too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I also like my online business. Actually my thesis for coding, for my app, was an online shop. I&#39;m actually going to post it up and actually start using it for myself.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. Put the link on the Instagram.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m going to. Actually, it is</span><span>&nbsp;Narzisse</span><span class="c2">... It&#39;s German for </span><span>narcissim</span><span class="c0">.. .com.mx.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s cool. All right, we&#39;ll get the info then.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s okay. Just plugging myself a little.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re right here. You&rsquo;re committed Hey, I&#39;m all for it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s actually... I said it in my speech. [inaudible 00:30:42]. Narcissus, she fell in love with herself. People think that&#39;s a bad thing. People think narcissism is just bad, vanity is bad. We shouldn&#39;t be trying so hard. It&#39;s like, &quot;Do you know what? I&#39;m doing it for me. I care about how I look, and I want to fall in love with myself. How is that a bad thing?&quot; You know what I mean? That&#39;s why it&#39;s called that because it&#39;s like, stop carrying that. Me because I&#39;m such a tomboy, but at the same time I really love makeup, so it&#39;s like, &quot;What?&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Who cares? I want to care about how I look too. I want to care about that, and it should be okay for people to care about how they look and not be called you&#39;re vain, you&#39;re such a narcissist.&quot; I love myself, so what.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I love that. That&#39;s so cool. I&#39;m also a big Greek mythologist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, awesome.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why German?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like German.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cool sounding.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like German. My aunt, she teaches German. She taught me a lot about philosophy. You know how the great philosophers are German </span><span>and </span><span class="c0">their ideas.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s how you learned it?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a little personal touch there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s based on a lot of things. It&#39;s like cats. My cat&#39;s name is Daffodil. I forgot what origin, but it&#39;s Narcissus. You know how Narcissus turned into a flower? That was the daffodil. That&#39;s why...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The flowers technically served her purpose and all that stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, that&#39;s why. Okay, that makes sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s because it was really symbolic.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just really pretty, yeah. That makes a lot of sense.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Their service is beauty. Then there&#39;s... Especially in such a </span><span>work, work, work</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;culture, beauty and all that seems frivolous but in reality, we do all of this. The things that are everlasting or celebrated are the museums of art and things that in the moment people think are wasting your time. Then in history, it&#39;s all we have to prove ourselves as more than just some species on this planet.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. Yes, thank you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;[Laughs] It&#39;s our interview now. I&rsquo;m just going off.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s great. That&#39;s how I feel. That&#39;s why I named him Daffodil because...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s so cool.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>And then</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;the actual image of it was based on my other cat. I put everything of myself into everything I do, like I said. It&#39;s just like you see that, you see me. You know that, you know me.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s incredible. I feel like with the experiences you&#39;ve had, you&#39;ve had to really at a young age be like, &quot;Okay, who am I?&quot; When you work through that so much, there&#39;s so much more room and material to put yourself into things when you know yourself enough to do that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember when I was a teenager, I was like, &quot;What do I like? What am I into? What do I not like? Why do I like these things?&quot; Really think about these things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Dive into philosophy [inaudible 00:33:24] crises and stuff.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there&#39;s religion, when I stopped believing in God. I was like, &quot;Why? Why do bad things happen? I&#39;m going to die one day. There&#39;s no afterlife. I don&#39;t know how to cope with that.&quot; That&#39;s a whole other thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, you sit too long with that and you just like, &quot;Uhh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but anyways.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s kind of a weird question. You can also take it any way you want, but if you were still in the US, what do you think that you would be doing?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;ve asked myself that a lot, but honestly, I never had enough drive there. I had these low expectations. When I was a child, my dream was to be a waitress because that&rsquo;s what my family did. They were waitresses. They worked at In-N-Out. That&#39;s all they ever were able to do for themselves. They were drug addicts. I just thought that&#39;s what I had in mind for myself. Then that&#39;s why I fell into substance abuse too because I&#39;m just like, &quot;That&#39;s who I am. That&#39;s who I&#39;m always going to be.&quot; You base yourself on your background. You don&#39;t think you can surpass it. I can&#39;t even say that I would be in a good place honestly. I can&#39;t. I can&#39;t say where I&#39;d be at all. I wouldn&#39;t know who I would meet. I&#39;m not that kind of person.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think also when people do answer, &quot;This is what I would be doing,&quot; a lot of it is also because a part of them is still living in that moment of wishing they were still in the United States, of living in that past. It&#39;s not like I&#39;m, &quot;That&#39;s not as good,&quot; or judging them in any way because obviously you&#39;re going to experience - </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course. I had that </span><span>a lot of the time</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;too.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I also think a part of when people who can no longer see where they would be in the US is because they&#39;re more... They could be more present in the moment that they&#39;re in now.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to be.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That could also be why.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Exactly. I&#39;ve built my life here already so I can&#39;t really imagine. I know if I go back, I&#39;d be a makeup artist because that&#39;s what I do now and a coder, but what I would have done, impossible. I had no dreams. I had no ambition. I was just told I was a deportee, an illegal immigrant, and there was no dreams. My mom, she studied to be a nurse and she still can&#39;t get a decent job. She makes less than my friends do. My friends work at call centers over there, and they make great money. My mom studied to be a nurse and she makes crap because they know they can pay her crap.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just because they know her status?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mm-hmm (affirmative). S</span><span>o, </span><span class="c0">I can&#39;t say my life would have been better there. Even though it was really painful to have to get accustomed to being here, I think it&#39;s the best thing that could happen.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Are you still in contact with your parents?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I try to be. I&#39;m not very good at it. It&#39;s emotionally draining to talk to my father. He&#39;s not very supportive at all. He&#39;s the opposite of supportive. My mother is just painful. Because I know I&#39;m not the person she wanted me to be. I&#39;m not religious. I&#39;m bisexual. I&#39;m not following the path that she wants me to follow, but she loves me, so I try to call her. My dad sends me money, so I try to call him. Honestly, there&#39;s no other reason. He even tells me that. It&#39;s pretty draining when I talk to him. But, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I&#39;m sure is a very draining thing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, he always talks to me like... because he knows I&#39;m smart. He says, &quot;You know you better&hellip; I&#39;m investing in you,&rdquo; basically because you know in the Mexican mentality, you take care of your parents when you&#39;re older? He knows that </span><span>I don&rsquo;t</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have that, so he knows that he has to give me money and sponsor me so that later on, I can pay it back to him and I will because I do have that &quot;I mean, come on, he did you a favor,&quot; but it&#39;s a business transaction for me. He&#39;s giving me money, and he&#39;s maintaining me until I&#39;m successful and I can maintain him. I can&#39;t say he&#39;s my father. You know what I mean? But my mom, she tries. Even though she can&#39;t understand me, she tries. I appreciate that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, yeah, you can love them without accepting aspects of who they are as well.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We respect each other&#39;s beliefs even though they don&#39;t coincide at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really difficult to navigate.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, definitely. I thank my dad for that. He&#39;s the one that helped her think that way. Even though he wasn&#39;t there for me, he&#39;s there for her a lot. You can tell he really loved her. They&#39;re divorced now, but you can tell he really cared for her. He really did teach her... He kind of enlightened her... open mind. Accept other people&#39;s beliefs and accept that not everyone&#39;s going to think like you and stuff like that. She&#39;s really accepting.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;She&#39;s a Jehovah&#39;s Witness as well?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, but she&#39;s over there. She&#39;s more understanding. Whereas here, her family, the one I lived with, they just do not understand. I&#39;ve gone to visit them, and they just ignore my preferences. They ignore my everything. They don&#39;t care about me. They don&#39;t try to respect my beliefs. I try to respect their beliefs. They don&#39;t try to respect my lack of belief, I guess. Come on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There</span><span>&rsquo;s a lot of, w</span><span class="c0">hen you get emotion and pride involved, it&#39;s really hard for a reason to even have a role in those dynamics.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. My dad always said, &quot;Be the bigger person.&quot; I was 16, and I had to be the bigger person amongst adults, but it teaches you to be the bigger person in general, I guess. Swallow your pride.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, living in that moment and being like, &ldquo;that was my job.&rdquo; That also at a certain point puts a drain on you to hold that sort of resentment also, which can be difficult. In terms of just zooming out of the picture, taking more of a reflective, just on migration, that&#39;s what we&#39;re studying here. I think I like having conversations like this because I think it shows... It dignifies and humanizes people. It&#39;s not just migrants as this whole... It&#39;s these very, very bright, driven individuals that you&#39;re deporting and not really realizing who these faces are, I think.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s why our conversations are just like this. I get to know you. Then zooming out and maybe some of your own opinions on what&#39;s going on with migration or just stereotypes that happen in Mexico and the US. Do you have any reflections on that? It&#39;s super broad. I can make it more specific if you prefer.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, more specific.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, let&#39;s do that because that was... I&#39;m also very long winded. With those stereotypes about migrants, about migrants, Mexican migrants in the US, what would you like them to know? Or why do you think they have those stereotypes?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I mean I think they have them because who migrates? Poor people. Then they usually live in a poor area. That&#39;s the thing, though, poor areas breed bad decisions, but it&#39;s not about the migrants themselves. There&#39;s poor areas with white people, there&#39;s poor areas with black people, there&#39;s poor areas with Asian. I mean, it&#39;s just poor areas. It&#39;s poverty that does that. It&#39;s not your race. It&#39;s not your heritage. It&#39;s, like I said, poverty. Where I lived is very privileged, so they weren&#39;t like that at all. There wasn&#39;t that stigma where I lived about illegal immigrants. Like I said, it was cool, but I know that the reason that people think that is because of that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because so many illegal immigrants being poor, they live in poor areas and they make poor decisions because that&#39;s just how it works. It&#39;s like, don&#39;t act like... Look at Eminem. Just saying. You know how his story&#39;s always like, &quot;We lived in a poor area and I was a gang banger, but now look at me.&quot; </span><span>And he</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;was white. There&#39;s so many people like that too. It&#39;s like, what&#39;s up with that? What&#39;s up with people who have drug pasts? They were drug addicts in the past, but they&#39;ve changed. They&#39;re better now. People accept them into the community, but when a Mexican does it, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, see, see, see what you&#39;re bringing.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Dude, we all make mistakes. Can you just let it go? Why is that bad and yours isn&#39;t?&quot; I guess it&#39;s just that. It&#39;s not about race.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it&#39;s about the status [inaudible 00:41:07] too. Especially when you&#39;re talking about white washing in the US and that kind of thing. I think one of the more painful things that happens also is in the US, the way that it takes from Mexican culture and the Chicano culture and romanticizes it. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I got this T-shirt, I was like, &quot;How am I going to do this in a respectful way?&quot; I was like, &quot;Okay, I&#39;m buying it here. I&#39;m supporting a local designer who designs with knowledge of this culture. As long as I&#39;m also respecting them, recognizing where it&#39;s coming from, then I feel like I can wear it.&quot; That&#39;s also something people don&#39;t have to agree. And like I&#39;d love to have a conversation about that, but it&#39;s the idea where I think there is a dynamic. Again, the US and people choose aspects of cultures with rejecting people.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. Like you said, romanticizing it. You always see a Mexican on TV, and they&#39;re white. It&#39;s just so annoying. The thing is also at my school, somehow that&#39;s just how it is in Mexico. White people who... Mexicans who are light skinned are just </span><span>more, they</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have money. I&#39;m not sure... I guess it has something to do with our past. That&#39;s going too far into the past. The two cases are people who migrate, there&#39;s the poor people who go there for a better chance, which is all anyone talks about, but then there&#39;s also the people that went to my school who were people with money, who were like, &quot;Let&#39;s try something else.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My ex-girlfriend, she&#39;s white. She&#39;s your skin tone. </span><span>And her</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;parents were the same. They&#39;re from money. Well, her father. They left because it&#39;s like, &quot;We have money. We have an opportunity here, but let&#39;s try something new.&quot; They went over there and of course it&#39;s a different background. What was my point?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were talking a bit about the dynamics of wealth and then color as well within - </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, sorry.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do not apologize.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My point is there&#39;s two different backgrounds, right? </span><span>And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;people always romanticize that one. The brown-skinned ones are the ones that suffer the most. Then the white-skinned ones are like, &quot;I&#39;m so Mexican.&quot; It&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, but you have that privilege of your own. You can pass as not Mexican. </span><span>And y</span><span class="c0">ou&#39;ve been raised without that suffering.&quot; They don&#39;t recognize it, and it hurts, I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I go outside of California, and it was like racism, right? Then you go outside of California, and it&#39;s just like... If anything, they&#39;re the right amount of exotic because they&#39;re white, but they&#39;re Mexican, so it&#39;s like, &quot;Yeah, that&#39;s cool. That&#39;s hip,&quot; but you&#39;re Mexican and brown, and it&#39;s like...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s palatable sort of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. It&#39;s like what they say about the Europeans who emigrate. It&#39;s like, &quot;You&#39;re illegal too.&quot; What&#39;s her face? Melania Trump. Is that her name?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanka.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ivanka Trump. I don&#39;t [inaudible 00:43:57].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The wife, the first lady.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, oh, Ivanka&#39;s the...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Daughter?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, no, Melania. Melania.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Melania. You know how they say that she&#39;s an immigrant from Europe and it&#39;s just like, &quot;Why doesn&#39;t she </span><span>qualify</span><span class="c0">?&quot; Because she&#39;s the good kind of immigrant. It&#39;s like, &quot;Because [inaudible 00:44:13] the ones that don&#39;t look Mexican, the ones that don&#39;t act Mexican. They&#39;re just Mexican secretly.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. [inaudible 00:44:22].</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, [inaudible 00:44:23] imagery.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Absolutely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s it really. Sorry, I just rambled on.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, that&#39;s important. Just pulling from what you were saying, I think a lot of the reasons why the US is justifying deporting is because they&#39;re presenting this face of what people also don&#39;t... The less palatable, the less desired aspects of Mexican culture by saying... If we present that, there&#39;s going to be less issues with the general public sort of. Until we love and recognize the amazing beauty, creativity, intellectual ability, the way they contribute across all different types of Mexicans on that spectrum that we&#39;re discussing. It feels weird to even call it a spectrum, but you get the general idea.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Then there&#39;s going to continue to be that mentality where somehow, it&#39;s okay. It&#39;s absolutely not, because humanity is humanity.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Exactly. It&#39;s horrible. I mean, they&#39;re people too. I say &lsquo;they&rsquo; because I see pictures and that&#39;s what I mean. People barely became aware of it. You know how they&#39;re like, &quot;They&#39;re putting kids in cages,&quot; or whatever. I&#39;m like, &quot;I was in a cage. No one cared about that.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean, it&#39;s just how they do it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When you were being deported?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, that&#39;s just the structure of it. Like, Y&#39;all are shocked? We&#39;re just starting to get shocked?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This has been happening?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I just thought it was normal honestly. When that happened to me, I was like, &quot;All right, I&#39;m getting deported. This is...</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you feel like it&#39;s normal now? Do you feel like with more perspective, it feels like, &quot;Wow, that shouldn&#39;t have happened?&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My problem is I do see their side. I don&#39;t know, I hate to say it, but at the same time, it&#39;s like, &quot;What do you do when you feel threatened? When you feel like they&#39;re taking your country?&quot; When you feel that way. I&#39;m not saying it&#39;s a legitimate feeling, but I do see the fear that they&#39;re feeling, and I can&#39;t really blame them for it either because the way they see it, it&#39;s illegal. If they don&#39;t understand our background, if they don&#39;t understand us, how can they understand what we&#39;re going through? How can they... I don&#39;t know. It&#39;s people who don&#39;t understand things. You can&#39;t really blame them for that. The way they see it, you&#39;re in their house.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s like if a homeless person comes and they&#39;re like, &quot;Can I live in your house?&quot; You&#39;re like, &quot;I&#39;m sorry. No. I feel for you, but no.&quot; I guess I... I don&#39;t know. Here too, in Mexico City, a lot of poor people come here from parts of Mexico. It&#39;s like, &quot;We&#39;re so overpopulated here. It&#39;s crazy.&quot; The subway&#39;s always full. It&#39;s just insane. People keep coming and coming. It&#39;s like, &quot;There&#39;s no more room,&quot; but I can&#39;t be like, &quot;No, don&#39;t come because you don&#39;t deserve an opportunity.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span>So it&rsquo;s just</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;kind of like that. I can see that too. We all want a chance, but if everyone comes for a slice of the pie, I guess there would be no left. You want your slice to be as big as possible. That means people don&#39;t get theirs. I can understand that selfishness because when you&#39;re raised with privilege, how do you understand the lack of privilege? I guess I can&#39;t really blame them for that, but obviously, I feel like it shouldn&#39;t happen. Obviously, I feel like people shouldn&#39;t be treated that way, but I can&#39;t, I don</span><span>&rsquo;t know,</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;hate. Can&#39;t be mad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">. break&hellip;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had a lot of anger too obviously when I first got here, a lot of anger. A lot of racism too against white people. I don&#39;t know, a side effect of being rejected like, &quot;Why do you deserve it, and I don&#39;t?&quot; Then you just start hating them. Things like that. </span><span>But you</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;have to move past it at one point. It&#39;s just really, really, really hard.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like I said, I got deported way before Trump and no one was looking at that. No one cared about that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Break.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think that&#39;s a perfect note... If there&#39;s anything else you want to add. Thanks for all your time. I really appreciate it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Yidah:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m good. Like I said, [inaudible 01:07:50].</span></p><p class="c1" id="h.gjdgxs"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;thank you.</span></p></body></html>
