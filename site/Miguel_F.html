How old you were, stuff like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Well, I believe what motivated my family was better opportunities for me and my brothers and just to reunite with our families and just live a better peaceful life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absolutely. You mentioned that you were like two years old when you migrated, so you don&#39;t really have any recollection of that but could you tell me a bit just about your childhood in the US? </span><span class="c1">What stuck out? </span><span class="c1 c8">What</span><span class="c1">&nbsp;are</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;some of your favorite memories?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t remember anything when I migrated to the United States, but once I was over there what I do recall was growing up in the neighborhood full of apartments, I guess where the lower income people live, and most of my friends were also half migrated from Mexico or their parents migrated from Mexico. And they&#39;re like my childhood friends. We did a lot of awesome things like went to the pool, went to the park. We played in the same basketball, soccer league. We did a lot of activities together. I would sleep over at their house and we were just the lower income kids, but we&#39;re just having fun, exploring the neighborhood and seeing a lot of wild, cool things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, exactly. And can you tell me a bit about your experience in school with friends you had going into elementary school, middle school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I was kind of popular since I have older brothers and my teachers knew my brothers, my sister. I&#39;m the youngest out of five. So I already had like a background since like my brothers were there, so I&#39;ve always been social with people and the only struggle or the thing I didn&#39;t like at the beginning was I didn&#39;t know much English. So I had to stay in the afterschool program so I could learn English quicker and better and well, I did it and now I speak it better than my Spanish.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you tell me a bit about the afterschool program and when it started?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes, it started about third grade. I want to do it because as a kid soon as the bell rings to go home, I just want to go home and </span><span class="c1">do what</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;kids do, which is probably watch TV and just hang out. But my mom, my family wanted me to speak English and it was very difficult for me since it&#39;s my second language, but I stayed there and it was actually very fun. It was besides learning English, it just gave me a new experience to interact with people and friends, meet new people and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. Yeah, I&#39;m really interested in like how the US has kind of worked like bringing second language into the curriculum just because having nurture education and at a certain point for people who are undocumented, it&#39;s kind of like, &quot;Okay, you should like school, like get involved.&quot; Then at a certain point, it&#39;s like, &quot;Oh, but you&#39;re not going to be able to go to college or pursue these other opportunities.&quot; So I think that&#39;s like a really important public dynamic to highlight. Did you like school or what was school like in your mind?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</span><span class="c1">Well</span><span class="c2 c1">, I liked school to meet people. I met my friends, but I can&#39;t... I don&#39;t like school. I am not really of all turn in papers or read this and the assignments. It wasn&#39;t really my thing. I guess it&#39;s still not my thing or I guess I&#39;m just lazy, but I was very... I was a sports person, so I was always in sports and stuff.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What kind of sports? You said soccer</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Soccer, basketball, cross country. That&#39;s about it. When I played it, but just every recess we had, we would play and that&#39;s what I would enjoy the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, were you on a team in high school too? </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, varsity soccer actually-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice, I also played soccer. I played lacrosse in college, which I really liked, but I played defense in soccer. It&#39;s so fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Wow, last man.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You played defense?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I </span><span class="c1">was last</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;man. I was captain since I joined for soccer team.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s awesome.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;My cousin right now, he has a full ride for a university in California. I think it&#39;s Chico State and he&#39;s playing soccer and we grew up together and I don&#39;t want to be cocky but I was better than him. But I lived in the poor side of the city and he lived in the </span><span class="c1">mid</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;class and he just didn&#39;t go through what I went through that kind of stopped me from achieving my potential.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Gangs, drugs, </span><span class="c1">women</span><span class="c2 c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When did that start for you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;When I was 15, 14.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Were you still playing soccer during this time or is that kind of when it stopped?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s when I was... Well, I was still playing soccer at that time, but slowly I was kind of separating. I was kind of not really, didn&#39;t really think about the future, just thinking about that day and going through day by day.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you did say that you finished high school and you started community college as well. So were you doing that or also participating in gangs and how did you balance that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I wasn&#39;t really in gangs at that time. I mean, my three older brothers, they&#39;re all gang members or they started off doing graffiti and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Doing what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Graffiti, tagging, writing on walls, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh yeah. No, I just didn&#39;t</span><span class="c1">...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And it was just mostly about art. I guess people wanted to catch fame by writing their name or something. And little by little, people were like, &quot;Hey, you can&#39;t be writing in my neighborhood, like what the heck? This ain&#39;t your neighborhood. This is freaking California&#39;s neighborhood or whatever, the government&#39;s and like nah, if you vandalize or tag around here, we&#39;re going to beat you up.&quot; It&#39;s like, why? Join our gang, we&#39;ll have your back and you can tag as much as you want. So little by little, my brothers got into a gang and middle school, I got kicked out of Fremont. So I had to go to a different middle school in a different part of my city, which I hadn&#39;t know it was the rival fight and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was the what?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Rivals, like the enemy side.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh okay, got it. Like two sports teams and stuff like that or? Oh-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different neighborhoods, different gangs, different like-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Got it. It&#39;s not like actually in the different gangs</span><span class="c1">.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different gangs, yeah. I don&#39;t know why, but there&#39;s a bunch of gangs as much as one doesn&#39;t want to be in it, they get involved and just kind of ruin everything. But so I wasn&#39;t even involved in the gangs at that time. I was mostly focusing </span><span class="c1">on soccer</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;and I used to get picked on... Well, not picked on because I would always defend myself. I liked to fight. I mean, I don&#39;t like to fight but I like to stand my ground. And well, I would get into a lot of fights or like-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think the fights happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because they knew my family. They knew where I was coming from. They just because I won&#39;t let somebody talk down on my family. So if somebody is speaking out loud of me or my friends or anybody that I hang out with or associated with, I won&#39;t put my head down. I&#39;ll have something to say, I have a very smart mouth, which also gets me into bad things. I was outnumbered, very </span><span class="c1">outnumbered</span><span class="c2 c1">. So I would get beat up a lot but I was just a young thing. So little by little, I was like, &quot;Man, I&#39;m already getting beat up.&quot; I&#39;m already basically, they already assume I&#39;m already a part of the gangs. So might as well be from me, now even I actually carry a gun and actually have my fucking brother&#39;s backs. And if anything happens, I know that they&#39;ll have me. I&#39;m already getting beat up for it and I have nothing to do with it. I don&#39;t even mean-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You&#39;re even being treated as a member</span><span class="c1">...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, just because I come from a different side of the city and they know my brothers because my brothers did a couple </span><span class="c1">of times</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;in jail, prison, whatever. I guess they just assume that I&#39;m a beat from there. So they already treat me as </span><span class="c1">an enemy</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;or rival.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So just in terms of like the geography, what gangs were you affiliated with in your original school? And then where did you go where like you were then being targeted for being in that and who were they?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I grew up on the north side of my city and right there, it&#39;s all like northwest, southeast, center, whatever. It&#39;s really pathetic. So I just grew up in the north side and I hung out with nothing but people from the north side and well, people would recognize people always seeing you with him or you&#39;re his brothers like, Oh, so then I got kicked out of Fremont, which was on the </span><span class="c1">northside</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;of where I lived.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, how old were you? What happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was a seventh grader, approximately 13. I was just not going to school. I would just ditch a lot. I really ditch a lot and I wouldn&#39;t do anything. I wouldn&#39;t do heavy drugs or anything like that. I would just hang </span><span class="c1">out in abandoned</span><span class="c2 c1">&nbsp;houses or my friend&#39;s moms wouldn&#39;t be at home. So we&#39;re just hanging out literally like every day and I missed so much that they expelled me from that school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it&#39;s for absences?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Absences, tardies and I have a very smart mouth. So I would talk back to my teachers too, all that stuff. So they had to transfer me to a different school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you think they knew that you might be in a more vulnerable position if you were at that school or do you think they had no idea?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, they had no idea. They had no idea. They didn&#39;t know. I mean, they had no idea. I didn&#39;t even have an idea I was going to get beat down and stuff like that. I just thought, &quot;Okay, new school.&quot; But I mean, I wouldn&#39;t dress baggy. I wouldn&#39;t just anything like that, I would just dress formal, I guess.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Then from there, you continued to go to school and then like soccer kind of stopped. Do you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c1 c8">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I broke my wrist</span><span class="c1">. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Playing soccer or?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I would... When I go in hard.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You like side tackle?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So I did and the guy landed on top of me with all his weight. Yeah, ever since then-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And ever since I broke my wrist, I kind of just started hanging out more and smoking more pot, the power of like put me in a better state of mind and just chill and this little thing, I had a cast all the way up here.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Cast. Oh damn!</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was literally like that for like a couple months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is not working, is it? Let me see.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Miguel</span><span class="c2 c1">:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So after that, I attempted to play soccer as a freshman. I played JV. I didn&#39;t play for the freshmen team. I played the junior varsity, but I just didn&#39;t play the same after that. I wouldn&#39;t go as hard or I wouldn&#39;t have the same speed or the same touch. I think I just kind of sucked after that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1 c8">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I mean it&#39;s pretty normal after an injury to be hesitant to like because your basic instinct was like, &quot;Oh, I remember having a severe injury from that. I&#39;m not going to do that again.&quot; And it&#39;s hard </span><span class="c1">to override</span><span class="c1 c8">&nbsp;that instinct and that totally makes sense. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, it wasn&#39;t the same. I used to play in a club team, so we would travel a lot and I would play coastal. Though I&#39;m from California, we were regional champions for Western Berlin. I play in the Premier League, which is you start off at bronze, silver, gold.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c1 c2">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This was his club?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It was club. They recruited me. I have that much skills.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the little kid that, in my neighborhood, I would play one against four.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh my gosh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then there was my little cousin that now has a full-ride scholarship for Soccer.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s as good as that. He&#39;s really good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Sports can be a huge door opener, but I think you also, I think you made a good point where it&#39;s depending on where you are and what kind of happens in your life, it can block even those opportunities. So then going from there in terms of moving away from sports and losing those opportunities. How old were you when you decided that you wanted to go to community college. What brought that about? Were you working already?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was finishing high school and it was just like, wow, we&#39;re already here. What do I do now? My mom said something about bills, paying rent, and I was like, oh shit, this is adult. This is life. After school hands like, &quot;This is reality.&quot; So I was like, okay, maybe if I got to school maybe I&#39;ll get a student loan and stuff like that. I went into school and I did digital photography and I really liked working with the negatives and positives and the camera and just editing and all that is really cool what you can do. But, I also had a lot of free time at my house. And with all the free time there would be a lot of people coming in and out of my house. And, little by little I just started hanging out with them and they see me like their little bro cause, well, they literally did grow with me since we lived in the apartments to living in a house. Those are my brothers. They&#39;ve proven me that they&#39;ll kill and I&#39;ll kill for them. That type of stuff.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t even know why it would get to that point. Why should we even harm each other or other people over the same streets. It&#39;s still the same city. This is pathetic now that I see it from a new different perspective. But, that&#39;s how it was and that&#39;s how it still is. And, it was just fun and I got introduced to bigger, heavier drugs. I felt invincible. I felt like I was... No one could stop me, especially at a young age. Having two jobs, having drugs, having womens, having cars. This is life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;This is life according to me at 18 or maybe 19 years old. I didn&#39;t really think about getting caught, I wasn&#39;t going to get caught for minor things, for big things. Point is that I didn&#39;t. Something that I didn&#39;t even do...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what were you... You mentioned in the survey and I wanted to make sure we got to it that you were excused of a crime that you didn&#39;t commit.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was there. I was present during what happened and then...</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, to cut it short, someone got stabbed and ended up being paralyzed for the rest of their life.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh wow.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Someone that was just walking by in the middle of the night through our neighborhood. And, one of my friends and he&#39;s Caucasian, he&#39;s and he&#39;s white. I&#39;m sorry I got nothing against...</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, you&#39;re fine. No, you can say anything you want.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He&#39;s Caucasian. He&#39;s white. Johnny Briggs, he knew he wasn&#39;t going to get deported. He knew his life was there. He knew, I don&#39;t know. He was drunk and went out to see people, and those people were just trying to go home after having some drinks at a bar. They weren&#39;t trying to cause any type of problems and my friend felt that just that cause they didn&#39;t want to share a single cigarette.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A cigarette?</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For a cigarette. For a pathetic cigarette. </span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c2 c1">Miguel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I don&#39;t believe in politics or, once you&#39;re a gang member or you&#39;re affiliated with that, there is politics between that.</span></p><p class="c4"><span class="c2 c1">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c2 c1"></span></p><div><p class="c7 c9"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c13"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c7 c10"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p></td><td class="c15" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c14"><span class="c8">Page </span><span class="c8">&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c10 c7"><span class="c2 c5"></span></p></div></body></html>
