I&#39;m here with Noe on recorder two. So tell me a little bit about what age you migrated to the United States?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was eight years old when I left.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You were eight years old. So you remember pretty well?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah, I remember, pretty well.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why&#39;d you leave?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That I&#39;m not sure.

We left I want to say 1990, 1991 maybe.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you remember crossing the border?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like a road trip in a vehicle going from state to another state. Just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Just like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It must be hard to think about that now when you watch the border.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s different now. It&#39;s difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so you arrived at eight and went to school?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I began second grade.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What was that like? Not knowing any English.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was in a Spanish class. I remember my teacher; I remember being in class in school. I don&#39;t remember it being difficult for me or adapting to my classmates or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you miss Mexico?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t think so. I don&#39;t remember thinking of missing it. I don&#39;t remember that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you like being in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What did you like about it?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;As an adult, it was my home. I enjoyed my life there.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And as a kid? What do you remember from your childhood? What are your memories there?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;From the age of eight till the age of 13, it wasn&#39;t great. It was a single parent... My mom with three kids. My mom worked a lot and school, but besides that, I don&#39;t have great memories of being a kid in the States or anything like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have bad memories?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I mean, nothing bad happened to me or my family, but it was us being in a new country and my mother working a lot. That&#39;s what I would recall the most.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, what kind of jobs did she do?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I want to say she worked at like hotels, housekeeping work at that time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you have siblings?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What number were you?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was the middle child.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when you came home in the evening, was your mom working?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so. I think so.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How much school would you do in the US?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;High school. All the way till high school.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you qualify for being a dreamer?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did not. And I think when that first came out, I was either already a resident or my criminal background wouldn&#39;t qualify me. Either one of the two.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you became a US resident?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did. I was a resident.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;A bad night, bad choices. I got pulled over. I was obviously breaking the laws. So a year and a half later, they took my residence and I got deported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you when you started getting into bad stuff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I started pretty young. I started when I was 13, small stuff. Not going to school. That was the beginning. Not going to school. From there, it just escalated to maybe getting caught with a little bit of weed, breaking into cars at night when I got to like 15, 16, and the same thing, not going to school is what kind of spiraled everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you become a member of a gang?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. Yes. Not by choice. It was part of my environment at the time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re trying to think about that. And you seem pretty reflective actually. Why do you think so many sort of young boys, teenage boys end up becoming members of games or sort of getting involved in sort of bad stuff? Can you help us understand that? We&#39;re trying to-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me say that we&#39;re trying to explain that you&#39;re not bad kids. That&#39;s part of what we&#39;re trying to do, okay? So you have-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c10">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re very sympathetic. So we&#39;re trying to find a way of writing about it and explaining it so people understand that circumstances</span><span>,</span><span class="c10">&nbsp;there are </span><span>some things</span><span class="c1">. What would you say?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, my experience, for me, it all kind of began by not having a parent around. We have a lot of time as kids and in our neighborhoods, there&#39;s usually that type of stuff going on, like gangs and drugs. My neighborhood wasn&#39;t that bad. I remember the complex that we lived at, when we arrived, that&#39;s not where I first noticed drugs or anything like that. But I would say for me, it began in middle school, maybe around seventh grade, 13, 14 years old, wherein from my experience, there&#39;s always a division between races, between different groups of friends. And then those groups of friends become the gangs.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, I didn&#39;t get involved till I was maybe 15 or 16, and it was just because that was part of my environment. At the age of 15 or 16, what I did for fun instead of going, I don&#39;t know, playing video games or maybe going to a skating rink, my fun was hanging out at night and drinking beer or smoking weed. And that&#39;s how I got involved with the wrong crowds in my neighborhood.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the second question becomes also is, we&#39;re trying to think about how to sort of help you steer in a different direction. What would you say, if you were talking to anybody, policy makers or the police or, anyone, organizations, what would you say? How can you help kids choose a different path, sort of stay in school, not get involved, sort of avoid the pull of the streets?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. What I could think that would have helped me is just having a little bit more education. I mean, obviously we went to school. I remember going to school from, I don&#39;t know, 7:30 to 3:30, but that was the days that I went to school. For the most part, I would skip. But just having more education around you in a way, either by some sort of afterschool program, or... For me, I just had too much time, too much free time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I remember walking home at 3:45 when all the school lets out, so everybody&#39;s kind of going their own way, and I didn&#39;t have to go home because there was nobody to say, &quot;Why didn&#39;t you make it home and you&#39;ve been out for an hour or two?&quot; I could get home at 7:00 or 8:00. And then between 3:45 to 8:00 or 10:00 PM, it was, &quot;let&#39;s go hang out and let&#39;s go smoke some weed.&quot; I can get home at 10:00. My mom gets home at 11:00, so I have all this time to do whatever we want to do.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did your mom know what you were doing, you were up to?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not at the beginning. I think at the beginning, she wasn&#39;t there. So if I got home at 10;00 and I was out doing whatever I wanted and she got home at 11:00, by the time she made it home, I was asleep. So to her, I&#39;m thinking, she probably thought, &quot;he got home at 4:00 and he watched TV and he ate and he fell asleep and he did his homework.&quot; But it probably wasn&#39;t like that most of the times.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, when and how did she find out?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Probably when I started getting arrested. My mom got in trouble actually for, I guess she was blamed for me or for not keeping track of me going to school at some point towards the end. But once I started getting arrested for being caught at 12 noon and I wasn&#39;t at school, I would go to a juvenile facility and then she would have to come get me. So once that happened after three, four or five times, then she started realize that I was up to no good. And she tried to steer me the right way, but...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So how did she react to that? Do you remember?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sure she was upset. I&#39;m sure she tried to helped me. I think for me, the weed was a big issue. I began when I was 13. I didn&#39;t begin as a daily user till I was about from 16 till the age of probably 30, I was a daily user. And from 16 to 18, I lived with her still. I think she would notice when I was high, but she would always tell me, &quot;You need to stop. It&#39;s not good for you. It&#39;s frying your brain cells.&quot; But at that point, I think I was already too deep into my friends and what I wanted to do. They always say I have like a strong character, so it was hard for my mom to kind of steer me the right way when I&#39;m 16 years old and I feel like I know everything.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Was it just weed?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mainly, mainly. I&#39;ve tried other stuff, but it was mainly just weed.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, you went to juvie?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I did.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then you got deported? What happened?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I went to juvie from the age of 13 to the age of 16.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the whole time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Not the whole time, on and off. Small things. My experience was I went to juvie, I got out, I went to juvie, I got out. Eventually They&#39;re like, &quot;okay, you need probation.&quot; So I was on probation. I went to juvie again for the same thing, either weed or skipping school. That was my whole teenage life.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And after so many times they intensify either your probation or your restrictions or your curfew, et cetera. And eventually after, I don&#39;t know, 10 times, they decided to send me to a Texas Youth Commission and I did that for about a year. So that was my first time doing time. I was 16 or 15. When I got out, my mom was like, &quot;Okay, you&#39;re just too much trouble. You need to just get yourself a job and grow up.&quot; And I did. I did that for about, I don&#39;t know, about three years. Because, my troubles were still there, but I was a little bit more responsible. I had a job, I had a car. I lived with my mom, but I still enjoyed smoking weed. And I began to sell it as a hobby or extra cash.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And then when I turned 21, I went out to celebrate my 21st birthday with a group of friends. I smoked, I did a little bit of cocaine that night, or maybe more than a little bit. I drank quite a bit and I got pulled over. And when I got pulled over, I&#39;m pretty sure it was due to the panic or the influences that I was under, I decided to go on a high-speed chase. And that&#39;s what caused me to... I pled guilty. I did a year in state jail and that&#39;s when ICE decided to take a look at my case and that&#39;s when I got deported, they took my residence away.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;One last question on this. The experiences in juvie, it obviously didn&#39;t change your path.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did it make you more likely to be in trouble because you had contact with other kids and you made friends who were involved in this stuff?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so. I think so. I don&#39;t feel like it helped because you obviously... I mean, you&#39;re in juvie. You&#39;re dealing with other criminals, so, you become a little bit more tougher when you&#39;re with a group of tougher kids, tougher guys so you want to be the same. I don&#39;t feel like it helped me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, instead of putting people in juvie, okay, would there be a better option for treating, once you sort of...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think so. For me I&#39;m a big believer in education.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The school skipper.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I mean back then, I really didn&#39;t care. My thing was, let&#39;s go have some fun.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But in retrospect-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But, yeah, in retrospect, it&#39;s my biggest mistake.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, after school sort of education, you&#39;re talking about after school education programs or extracurricular activities or something like that?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Something to keep you off the streets. Something to keep your time occupied from hanging out with your next-door neighbor that&#39;s smoking weed or doing other things.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you something. You look incredibly serious. I mean-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I get that a lot.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We talked to like 300 people in the space of a year. And, you don&#39;t look the part.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The part of?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of somebody who was sort of a gang banger or...</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Because I&#39;m really not that guy. I&#39;m not that guy. A lot of my friends are but I don&#39;t have a single tattoo on me. My initial gang initiation, it wasn&#39;t by choice. It was like, &quot;you&#39;re going to join tonight. You don&#39;t have a choice.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning, if you don&#39;t what happens?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Meaning you begin tonight. There&#39;s no other choice. This is what&#39;s going to happen.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if you didn&#39;t?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And if I didn&#39;t, I don&#39;t know. I don&#39;t feel like my life was at risk or anything like that, but it wasn&#39;t like, &quot;Hey, we have a big party for you coming up this weekend.&quot; It was just that day, me and my best friend became part of the gang and that was that. And then the next day we were like, &quot;yeah, we&#39;re part of the gang now.&quot;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It wasn&#39;t something that serious. It&#39;s not something that I enjoy now or back then. It was something that it was part of the group so you were part of the group. That was that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other thing we&#39;d like to write about is, and I don&#39;t know if you believe this is true or not, but, it sort of has this title, made in America, remade or redeemed in Mexico and about people who&#39;ve turned their lives around. And there&#39;s all this talk about all these bad people coming across the border. And what we want to write about is the system in the US creates these challenges for-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Poor and undocumented youth. And that, post this phenomenon it seems as if, some kids continue to be in trouble, but a lot of people turn their lives around. what&#39;s been your experience?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I&#39;ve been deported four times, four times. It sounds like a lot, but again, it&#39;s not like what you would imagine of a person. Just like a gang member. Maybe I don&#39;t look like that but that&#39;s kind of how this four times being deported.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. I just mean, what you must have suffered was my reaction.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was tough. It was tough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That was my reaction, it&#39;s not-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was very tough.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;... To you being in a gang. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was tough. This time, and this is what I would consider my main deportation. This time it was different. This time when we... I got deported through Texas through Laredo. As soon as we cross, we were picked up, gathered by some sort of government entity. And they helped us out. Phone call, food, picture, some sort of form that identifies who you are.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I had enough to get my bus ticket. So from there, it&#39;s like, you always get your bus ticket and leave Laredo because it&#39;s such a dangerous town. For me it was okay. I didn&#39;t run into any trouble or anything like that. And neither did any of the people that were with me. It was about, say about nine of us, eight guys and one young girl.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, I already had a plan. I&#39;d been in federal prison for about a year and a half. Almost three years out of the last four I was in federal prison. I got out, I went back, I got caught. I did another year and a half. I got out. So for the first two times, for those three years that I was locked up, I was reading and I was researching best countries to live in Mexico, what kind of jobs there was in Mexico, what to do? Just research in Mexico because I&#39;d never... I mean, I left when I was eight.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I already kind of had a plan. I had top five cities to move to. What to do when I got there. How much was rent, how much I needed to begin a business, things like that. And I chose to come to Mexico City because of &ldquo;New Beginnings&rdquo; So I saw them on the news one day and I was like, &quot;okay, that sounds really cool. I&#39;m going to Mexico City.&quot; And then I saw about Ola code. So Ola code is the main reason why I chose Mexico City.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I got here, I started a job. I needed income and I needed a place to stay as soon as possible. So, I got a place to stay within the first three days, which is where I&#39;m at now. Still there. I&#39;m very happy where I&#39;m at. I got a job within the first 10 days. So, I got that job. That job didn&#39;t work out because I got a better offer somewhere else. So, I only started that for about two or three weeks and then I started at AT&amp;T, which is better pay. So I chose that job and I&#39;ve been there since June of last year.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what happened to Ola code?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Ola code, I did the test. I was going to do the interview, but I want to say the day of the interview, I had to move. So it was either go to Ola code or get your place to stay, so I chose get my place to stay. After that, I never really followed through because then AT&amp;T came into place so Ola code was kind of just put on the back burner per se.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I have three friends of mine that went to Ola code and they just didn&#39;t recommend it for me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;d say it, but their experience was, they felt like it&#39;s not a good idea. They felt like it&#39;s a scam.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s a scam because it costs so much and then you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I only know one guy that actually graduated and he&#39;s at AT&amp;T. And I was really happy when I saw it, I was like, &quot;Oh wow, that&#39;s great. That&#39;s a great idea.&quot; And that&#39;s why I chose to come to Mexico City. But, my friend, he graduated, I don&#39;t know, four or five months ago and he still doesn&#39;t have a job with his certification or whatever training he got.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The other two that were there, for some reason, they failed the program or they got kicked out or whatever the case might be. They just don&#39;t have great things to say about it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s really interesting. I wonder whether any of them would be willing to come and talk to us. Because, everybody says that it&#39;s the one program, everybody raves about... It&#39;s like no one in the state. If you could ask them if they&#39;d be willing to come and-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Talk.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I only have contact with one of them because he works at AT&amp;T but I&#39;ll ask him. He&#39;s part of the New Comienzos so I&#39;m sure he&#39;s aware.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We doing, New Comienzos is helping us, but this is an independent project too so-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Sure. No worries. I&#39;ll definitely mention it. He&#39;s a really good guy.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;d be great. Why did you try to go back four times?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because of my family. The first time it happened in 2005. I was 22. It was my first time in Mexico from the time that I left at eight years old. So when I got to Mexico, there was no chance I was staying. Zero chance.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;There was no way. I mean, I was 22. I wasn&#39;t a father at that time. My family&#39;s always been my mom, my sister, my brother and myself, just four of us. It was four at that time. And when I got deported, it was a big shock. Everything was a big shock. I mean, I felt I&#39;m a resident, I&#39;m untouchable, I&#39;ll never get deported. I think the reason why I say that is because I had so many run ins with the law as a teenager, the same as an adult from the age of 17 to the age of 20, can&#39;t even recall the amount of times that I got arrested for either not paying a traffic ticket or getting pulled over with weed in the car. That was my thing.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so, when that happened in 2004, when I get pulled up by ICE, I&#39;m like, there must be a mistake. I have papers. I have a residence card. I have a social security number. They&#39;re like, &quot;no you&#39;re coming with us.&quot; &quot;Oh, there&#39;s got to be a mistake.&quot; So eventually I saw the judge, eventually I saw that this is serious. We got an attorney and next thing I know after being in an immigration hold for about five or six months, out of nowhere, at 2:00 AM, they call me and they&#39;re like, &quot;You&#39;re getting deported today.&quot; And I was in Mexico the next day. So, it was all a big shock.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So every time you want to&hellip;</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. What happened is I got deported for the first time 2005. I stayed in Mexico for three months. I stayed at [Foreign language 00:26:22] for about three months in country, mountain area, no big buildings, nothing like that. Just helping out an uncle because he provided me shelter and that was fine. No responsibility, just working, probably a neighborhood of, at the most 500 people out in the mountains, horses and cows and things like that. And that&#39;s not me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So eventually, after talking with my family, I&#39;m like, &quot;The choice is made. I&#39;m going back and it&#39;s just a matter of time whether you guys help me or not.&quot; Of course my family&#39;s always willing to help even to this day. And we made a decision that I would come back and I made it back and I stayed in the US from 2005 to 2016. 11 years under the radar. And that was great because I had two kids during those 11 years. I met someone, of course, the mother of my children and I was doing well. I had a great job and then I get pulled over.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The odd thing about that is, when I get pulled over, of course I&#39;m scared. I&#39;m like the day is here. I was waiting for the day and I would talk about that with the person that was with me at the time, &quot;One day, this day is going to come and it&#39;s going to happen.&quot; We need to be prepared for this day.&quot; And of course it was the least expected day, on the way home from work, two blocks away from the house.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So, I get pulled over. Again, I panicked, I don&#39;t know what to do and I gave him a fake name. I obviously don&#39;t have a driver&#39;s license, don&#39;t have any sort of ID to prove. And when they take me down to the... I was supposedly pulled over for speeding, but there&#39;s no way I was speeding two blocks away from the house. Either way, it was two undercover cops. I think they thought I was doing something in the neighborhood because the way they searched the car, &quot;what are you doing here?&quot; and things like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Anyway, I get down, they search my fingerprints and what keeps me in jail at the time is that I had a warrant from 2003. Just something that I never took care of. As far as I was aware, everything was taken care of through my attorney, back in 2005, when all of this happened, a paid attorney. Something fell through the cracks where my fingerprints were still related to some sort of either a weed charge or a warrant or something from 2003. And that&#39;s what kept me in jail.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I tried to pay my bond to get out, but by then, I already had an ICE hold. And that&#39;s what caused me to get deported my second time.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But this time you already have children.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;By this time I have two children. I&#39;m an adult. I&#39;m not really hanging out-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were your kids at that time?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;At that time, they were young. They were like three and five.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And you were how old?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was about 30. I was about 30 years old.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Okay. Just go ahead.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;After that, due to my criminal background, if you get deported, you&#39;re a convicted felon and you go back and you get caught, that is a federal crime. It&#39;s an illegal re-entry and the federal system has a guideline to send you to, based on your record and based on, I don&#39;t recall what else. So either way, within a couple of days, I get transferred to a federal facility and I&#39;m facing illegal reentry. I got a really good break from the judge and I only get 18 months for illegally reentering the country after I got deported in 2005, 10 years later.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So they give me my 18 months. I do my time and I come to Mexico. I decided to go to Monterey because it&#39;s close to the border, et cetera. I stayed there for about eight months or so. I worked at a call center there but I wasn&#39;t happy. I wasn&#39;t happy. I missed my children. On New Year&rsquo;s Day-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita: &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp; &nbsp;Boys or girls?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Two girls.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. If it wasn&#39;t for my kids at that time, I think I would&#39;ve just said I&#39;m okay and I&#39;ll stay. Kind of like how I feel now. But at the time, I missed my kids too much. So after being there for about eight month, and they would come and visit. Even to this day, I see them every three months.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;They come and visit now every three months?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. They come every three months. I&#39;m going to see them in about three weeks. So it helps, it helps. So all thing happened. I was okay at my job. I was okay where I was living, but I was by myself and I missed my kids. And one day out of nowhere on New Year&rsquo;s Day, I just said, I&#39;m going back today. And I made the choice to go back and I got caught.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Again, for your kids?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. For my kids. After I had my kids, everything&#39;s been for my kids. I got caught so I get deported again within five days. So that was a huge lucky break. Because I&#39;m again, illegally reentering the country. Five days later, they let go and I&#39;m relieved and I&#39;m shocked. After going through such a hard time, trying to cross, I get caught and then I&#39;m like, &quot;no, I can&#39;t. I&#39;m going to just stay.&quot; And of course, the friends that are with, they&#39;re like, &quot;No, you got to try one more time. We were so close, we can make it.&quot; So I try it a second time a week later. That second time that I try, that time, I got deported through &ldquo;Reinosa&rdquo; which is the same town that I was trying to cross from the place where they deported me.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So I tried that third time to go back and I get caught. And this time they didn&#39;t give me a break. So this time, again, the same process that I went through in 2015, which is, go straight to a federal judge, magistrate. And again, they give me another year and a half. And then I get deported for this last and fourth time last May of 2018. And I think by then I&#39;m done. I don&#39;t want to try it anymore.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Let me ask you this question, and then one last question, which is, again, a reflective question as I... you know there&#39;s so many cases of family separation, that has to be the absolute worst thing. Can you just sum up what it feels like to be deported and separated from your family and why that makes you want to keep going back, that it&#39;s a stupid policy. Tell us what it&#39;s like to be separated from your family? Can you put it in words?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s heartbreaking. It&#39;s very tough. Very tough. The first time is-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you say... It&#39;s because I want to have this snippet. Can you say, it&#39;s heartbreaking to be separated from your family.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s heartbreaking to be separated from your family, mainly from your kids. I mean, from your parents, your brother or sister, you&#39;re okay, they&#39;re adults, you&#39;re an adult, we can handle yourself. But from your kids, it&#39;s very difficult.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s the most difficult part?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;For me, it&#39;s just not being there for them. I mean, even though I&#39;m a phone call away or a flight away, just not being present. That&#39;s it.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s it like working in a call center? Let&#39;s change topics.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s good. It&#39;s good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why is it good?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;You want a glass of water?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Thank you, thank you.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Take your time. I&#39;m really sorry. Can I have you-</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay. Sure.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I can&#39;t stand this.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s okay.</span></p><p class="c7 c14"><span class="c1"></span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think I&#39;m okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m okay.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So the call center is good?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The call center&#39;s good. It&#39;s good. From my experiences, speaking about AT&amp;T, it&#39;s a great company. I&#39;m very happy there. There&#39;s lots of opportunities for growth.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m a real customer.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So am I. But, telecommunications, it&#39;s a big company. They just acquired Direct TV. So the job&#39;s really good. I&#39;m very happy there. It&#39;s a little bit stressful to be honest with you, but I&#39;m very happy with the environment. It&#39;s obviously a bilingual call center, so for the most part, you speak in English to your coworkers, to the customers that you&#39;re speaking with. They&#39;re all United States calls. So it feels like your daily life that I&#39;ve had for most of my life. So I enjoy it. So far so good.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nobody must t ask you about your accent because you have a completely American accent.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. It helps. It helps.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Your whole intonation, your expression, the way you deliver your message.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It definitely helps because of course we have a lot of guys and girls that they grew up in States and that&#39;s where they learned the language, but then we have a lot of local people and they learned the language here. They have a little bit of an accent or some other people that just, for some reason they have that accent and you can tell they&#39;re foreign. It definitely helps me and it feels good. It feels good when they complement you on something like that.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s complicated, right? Because call centers are where everybody goes after immigrating, there&#39;s turnover, but yet, it&#39;s also a place where you also interact with Mexicans, right?</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Of course.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And there&#39;s less discrimination of people. </span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Noe:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. For me, what I like is that my daily life, it&#39;s speaking English and it&#39;s things that you have in common. I mean, I can talk to people about Texas or the NBA or NFL, things that I can&#39;t speak to my next door neighbor about because they never been to Texas, they don&#39;t really follow the Dallas Cowboys, things like that. Just things that I grew up with.</span></p><p class="c0"><span class="c1">Anita:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&rsquo;s so interesting]. So, we can stop.</span></p><p class="c0 c7"><span class="c1"></span></p><div><p class="c6"><span class="c1"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.1"></a><table class="c5"><tbody><tr class="c4"><td class="c13" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></td><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c2"><span>Page </span><span>&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c3"><span class="c1"></span></p></div></body></html>
