So just to start, do you think you could tell me a bit about how old you were when you migrated and what were the motivations for your family to come to the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Alrighty. So I was around 12, most likely we were just in a journey, but then we realized that there is a lot of opportunity to make some money that could actually help us out to grow up. My mom has no studies, she has no degree, so we thought we, and I&#39;m speaking of my sister and me, did it first then she can get her papers or something like that. And we tried, she started working. We didn&#39;t, but I don&#39;t know, time passed really fast. And when our </span><span class="c2">residence </span><span class="c2 c7">went down, we tried to continue the </span><span class="c2">process</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;and asked for more time where maybe now has a permanent residence, but more time, extend the limit. We&#39;ve been told no. We also get behind. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Can you, just to backtrack, tell me about your early childhood in Mexico. You mentioned that you went to school, but you were also working for a little bit as a waitress. You can start there and then talk about how your experiences shifted when you came to the US? What was different? Starting there.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So it has always been my mom, my sister and me. As far as I remember working here, in Mexico, has </span><span class="c2">always been</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;pretty hard. You work a lot, but you don&#39;t get paid what you deserve. So I guess we were living okay, surviving. So when we were there, we saw a difference, there&#39;s more in life than being just surviving. But we also realize that it comes with a price to pay, you&#39;re not free, because that&#39;s not your country, so you&#39;re not entirely part of it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So basically we saw the education is way better right there. Here, teachers, they don&#39;t care about what you learn. They just want to do their job and get paid, that&#39;s it. We also realized that you don&#39;t have to live together-together with your neighbors. You can have your own spot. You know what I&#39;m saying?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And</span><span class="c2">&nbsp;</span><span class="c0">look around, I was like, &quot;It&#39;s full of people right here.&quot; What else?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you mentioned that the education was one reason, it&#39;s a lot better, you&#39;re saying in the US?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Definitely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you go to school in the US though?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, I didn&#39;t. No, I didn&#39;t.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why was that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because I used to have a lot of friends and they taught me. First of all, I didn&#39;t know how to speak English, so they taught me talking, going around, and then they show me like their novels, their books. They were all colorful, full of information, I guess. But I couldn&#39;t read at all, because I didn&#39;t know how to speak English. It took a while. But then when I couldn&#39;t, I started learning by my own, asking for books, libraries, and pretty much that&#39;s it. I ain&#39;t went to any school really.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And why didn&#39;t you go to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I guess my mom was too busy to get involved in all of that. I think she tried, I can&#39;t remember that much, but I think she tried to get us into school, both of us, but then I don&#39;t know what happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you want to go to school?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m sorry. What?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Did you want to go to school when you were younger?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Definitely. Yeah. Because when I was walking outside, I always saw all of the kids running all happy with their moms and it&#39;s a really good picture, right? They&#39;re going out of the school so happy, it must be good. It must be cool. Yeah. It never happened.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So what did you do during the day since you didn&#39;t go to school? Spend your time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I was just chilling around and sometimes I used to go with my mom and help her out, she used to clean, so I learned a lot. But since her boss didn&#39;t want us to be there, we were there when he was not there. So we help her, and then we left and we were chilling around basically.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you have any favorite restaurants in the US? Your favorite kind of food? Or some memories that you enjoy?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No, not really. We can&#39;t afford any of that, but I used to miss tacos, because I know them already.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Right.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So when we were there, and we tried once, Taco Bell, it was like, &quot;No. This ain&#39;t real. Uh-uh.&quot;</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No. After having the real thing, it&#39;s quite different. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Different, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, my gosh. A world of difference.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;So you mentioned that you did have some friends who had been to school and </span><span class="c2">show what school was like. </span><span class="c0">What were your friends like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nice. Pretty nice. Th</span><span class="c2">eir parents too</span><span class="c0">. But I remember that where we used to live, it was a trailer, we have a lot of neighbors, but some of them, they know about our situation and sometimes they were kind of rude. I wouldn&rsquo;t say aggressive, I would say rude. I kind of understand why we were facing that, but it&#39;s still not good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;No.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why do you think they were rude?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think they&#39;re afraid. They&#39;re still afraid, because we&#39;re unknown. It seems like we&#39;re unknown, but we&#39;re still people. We still have hopes, dreams just like them.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But I think they&#39;re afraid because there are a lot of rumors about Mexican people and so on, and so on, and so on. But I think the best way to realize what is really going on is to get close up to people and ask them, &quot;Hey, what&#39;s up? What&#39;s really going on?&quot; It&#39;s different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Did your sister have a similar experience? Wanting to go to school? Or having other friends?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I guess so, because I&#39;m more </span><span class="c2">heart-street </span><span class="c0">and she&#39;s more homemade. She used to chill with her friends, but just playing video games. I don&#39;t know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But you wanted to get books from the library?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I used to walk around. It&#39;s pretty cool right there. It&#39;s all green and I love to walk along and have adventures. So yeah, I used to go to the library, but then I stopped. I lost my ID and I don&#39;t remember why I didn&#39;t get it back. Yeah. I used to go a lot, and then when the time to come back arrived, we used to hide. So I guess that&#39;s why we didn&#39;t get back all of our stuff, like my ID, for example, because I was afraid. I was afraid to be on the outside and get caught.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I think it&#39;s just important to hear, people don&#39;t understand, sometimes they think, &quot;Oh, people migrate here and they just take advantage of everything.&quot; But in reality, there is a lot of fear and paranoia that can go with having an undocumented status and it can be difficult. I don&#39;t think people realize that. Can you tell me just what it was like </span><span class="c2">to say</span><span class="c0">, &quot;I want to go to the library, go outside,&quot; but also be paranoid at the same time?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Well, in your mind, you&#39;re like, &quot;I need to do this and this and this and this,&quot; but you also feel like you&#39;re not stepping in something real, you&#39;re getting to another reality where you actually need to take care of not being caught. I remember this, </span><span class="c2">pretty clearly</span><span class="c2 c7">, when I was walking, I saw those cops look right straight at me. They didn&#39;t say anything, but it was uncomfortable, because I was just working, and this time they looki</span><span class="c2">ng</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;at me like, &quot;We know.&quot; That&#39;s how it felt, like, &quot;We know,&quot; right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. </span><span class="c2">It must have been </span><span class="c0">hard for you.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. And I started walking fast like, &quot;No. Please no,&quot; Because I was afraid.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;How old were you?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Around 14, 15 maybe. But what I was afraid of most is, I can&#39;t get caught and then I will be without my family, because I felt like the only one was about to get deported was just me. And I thought like, &quot;No. I don&#39;t want to lose my mom. I don&#39;t want to lose my sister either.&quot; So it feels like they&#39;re always looking at you. Do you see what I&#39;m saying?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yes. That&#39;s a really good way of describing it.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I don&#39;t want to bring you back to that feeling at all.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not that bad.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No. I can&#39;t imagine. so then you spent, was it seven, seven and a half years?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Six and a half, around seven.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;In the US, and during this time you kept to herself, no school or work, but how was your relationship with your sister? Did you have each other? And what was that like?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Very good. Pretty good, actually. We understood we need to keep it together in all of this. We cannot pull us apart. We cannot fight. We only have each other. That&#39;s what my mom told us.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Do you know what your mom&#39;s hopes was or are for you and your sister while you were in the US at least?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To have a degree. To have a degree, because she studied here. She didn&#39;t have a degree, but she started halfway. And she told us, &quot;It&#39;s way too different. You should take advantage of that.&quot; I was just a kid, right? But then I started realizing, as far as I remember, we don&#39;t have this in Mexico. We should take advantage of it. School, just like you said, if you go outside of a Mexican school, you can see a difference. You can see what I&#39;m saying. And I remember that. Yeah. She was hoping we can actually get a degree or a job, or just a decent life. But it is what it is I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. So then what led to you returning back to Mexico then?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Because first of all, we were afraid to get caught. Also, she thought that maybe one day, one of us would like to go back. And if you get deported, you cannot do that anymore. So she was like, &quot;If you, at any time want to go back. Just don&#39;t lose this chance,&quot; that&#39;s why we came back. We have family. We&#39;re good I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hmm?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;We&#39;re good I guess.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Can you tell me what maybe some of the challenges were adapting back to Mexican society from a different society?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Definitely. Yeah. It seems like everything&#39;s new again. I already know here, but I don&#39;t at the same time. And people, when I came back, it&#39;s not that I forgot how to speak Spanish, that&#39;s nothing that you can also forget, right? But I was changing some phrases, and when people used to hear me and was like, &quot;Where are you from?&quot; &quot;I&#39;m from here. What do you mean?&quot; &quot;No, no, you&#39;re not from here.&quot; But get into that again is like, oh, here we go again, everything&#39;s new.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That seems to be a trend. </span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It was not that bad though. I think that helped a lot, there was actually that we </span><span class="c2">speak Spanish as well. </span><span class="c0">And also over there, we used to do it at home. Because our street, we used to talk in English, the same reason, but at home my mom used to talk to us in Spanish, so we never forget that though.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s good then. This is a weird question, so do with it what you will. Do you feel Mexican or American?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Mexican. Hell, yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hell, yeah. Why is that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, I don&#39;t know. This is who I am, you cannot change that. Even though you move out a country, a continent, you are what you are at the end, I think you never forget that. I think when you forget that is when you lost your identity, most likely people take advantage of that. So as long as you remember who you are and where you&#39;re coming from, you&#39;re good.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I like that.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know some people say, oh, you talk different or you have these different things about you because of your time in the US, and some people may say &quot;Oh, you&#39;re from neither here or there,&quot; some people they don&#39;t know you may not have the same experience, but some people think you&#39;re too Mexican to be American or too American to be Mexican. That&#39;s a trend you see. What would you say to that?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say I&#39;m 100% Mexican. I never changed that. It took a while to get into the Mexican stuff again. But at the end we already knew that. So it was not that hard. I also think that it&#39;s because I didn&#39;t spend a lot of years there. So I know people working where I&#39;m working, they spen</span><span class="c2">t their whole</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;life, so that will be different if I spend like 22 years out of 23, I guess that will be different.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;What&#39;s it like at the call center with so many people having spent time in the States? Do you think it&#39;s different than other jobs?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s bringing some part of them right here. I know you, I got you. But at the same time here we are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s not that bad. It&#39;s funny. It&#39;s funny though. I wouldn&#39;t say funny, I would say it&#39;s like a circle you belong to, we&#39;re half and half, but still here we are.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. One person described as walking into the US and then when you walk out, you&#39;re back in Mexico.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Kind of. Yeah. Yeah. Yeah. Because once you get in, we all speak English and we&#39;re always chilling about it. We also understand the jokes from there. If you say a joke right here to the people would say, &quot;What&#39;s that? I didn&#39;t get it,&quot; but you can chill out with them and they understand, but then you&#39;re outside, it&#39;s like </span><span class="c2">qu&eacute; paso? Otra vez est&aacute;s en la calle y te agarras. (what happened, once again you&rsquo;re out on the street and you take hold of yourself) &nbsp;</span><span class="c0">Yeah. You&#39;re Mexican again.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Well, that&#39;s really interesting. I think it&#39;s interesting, little bits of both countries can find their places in both.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And that&#39;s what we combined, it&#39;s healthy. There&#39;s nothing like some people think. They think we&#39;re toxic or something.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c8 c16"><span class="c0"></span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m forgetting the word, </span><span class="c2">preconceived</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;ideas about people, or stereotypes, that&#39;s what I was thinking of.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Correct. Correct. Most likely.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Hopefully that&#39;s part of what we&#39;re trying to do with this project.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Seriously?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Why are you doing this?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. That&#39;s a very fair question. Me, individually? Or the project as a whole?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individually.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Individually. I think for me, I personally was born in the US, I grew up a US citizen, so I don&#39;t have the same identity of a migration in a personal way. But just from my experience, I used to be a teacher&#39;s assistant working with young kids who were migrants, who had to learn English, going through the schools and some were in an undocumented statuses with their family. And just the ways I think that the government, both Mexican and in the US, failed to protect people, or separated families.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know. I think the way that we&#39;ve allowed policies and laws to dehumanize people and act like it&#39;s normal or okay. I think it&#39;s just become something that doesn&#39;t sit right. And so when I went to college in the US and-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I don&#39;t know who&#39;s doing worse, to be honest. If they&#39;re trying to kick out or if they&#39;re give us a </span><span class="c2">h</span><span class="c0">it. Because they said they would, they don&#39;t. And that&#39;s the worst part, because if our own people is not taking care of us, who will?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. And I think that&#39;s what we&#39;re also highlighting too, is the Mexican government says that it&#39;s doing things, but then every single person we&#39;ve talked to either, &quot;No, I don&#39;t know any organizations that have helped me,&quot; or when I come here, I feel like people don&#39;t want me here as reintegrating, there&#39;s some sort of rejection there. Or even people who want to continue their studies, doing credit to the US and then having paperwork not go through, not only are both governments putting people in these positions-</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, true. And they have to start all over again. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And they&#39;re also creating roadblocks at the same time. There&#39;s no real accountability on either side. And then on top of that separating families, and not only on logistical, okay, you&#39;ve uprooted my entire life, you&#39;ve taken everything from me. Can I at least have my paperwork to try to have a new life here? And then on top of that, you&#39;re going to take my family away from me? So I think there&#39;s just so many levels that aren&#39;t being recognized to the full extent. I think we&#39;re going to look back on this in history and be like, &quot;This was a human crisis,&quot; how the US and Mexico and Central American countries handled this, in our history books is going to be a horrible time, a black spot on our history.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Like the rhetoric that Trump has about people, that&#39;s going to be in the history books for people to read generations later. And we need people to share their stories and get the correct account of things.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I know. I know. I know. I know. To be honest, when all the... May I say something political?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oh, by all means.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;To be honest, </span><span class="c2">when all</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;the Trump stuff started, I felt safe here. Like, &quot;Damn. If I got &nbsp;caught right now. I don</span><span class="c2">&rsquo;t </span><span class="c0">know what would happen.&quot; They scared me a lot, because I started to see some videos. So from my people right there, getting into fights just to survive, just because some American, I wouldn&#39;t say yelled at them, but some of them go all crazy. All of a sudden they hit us without any reason, and they&#39;re trying to chasing us, well not us, because I&#39;m here already, right?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. .</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;But that&#39;s my people. We&#39;re not trying to attack anybody. We&#39;re not trying to invite any inside, take your </span><span class="c2">stuff.</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;We&#39;re just trying to survive. I would say survive.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. Yeah. And it&#39;s scary that there had to be people who thought that way for Trump to be elected.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s amazing.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c2 c7">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I&#39;m </span><span class="c2">wordless </span><span class="c0">and speechless. I just can&#39;t believe it, that just one man can change all people&#39;s mind.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think he tapped into something that was there in some factions, but I was talking to another person too, the difference is, people were deported under Obama. There was lots of deportations then, but Obama wasn&#39;t publicly racist.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;And so Trump coming out and openly saying these things about human beings and acting this way is okay, opened the </span><span class="c2">floodgates</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;almost.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. I think he used some key words, like &ldquo;we.&rdquo; We&#39;re doing this for us and something like that. That&#39;s why they changed their mind so fast. Yeah.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;He got his rhetoric.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;It&#39;s amazing, to be honest. I&#39;m going to give him some credits for that, because, whoa.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2 c7">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Yeah. No. I think that&#39;s really interesting. Is there anything else you&#39;d like to add before we wrap up? </span><span class="c2">That</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;you want people to know?</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c2">Nadxieli:</span><span class="c0">&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;I would say you&#39;re not alone guys. You&#39;re not alone that way on that side, and you&#39;re not alone on this side. You always have a family or him to help you out. I would say that, you are not alone.</span></p><p class="c1"><span class="c0">Isabel:&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;That&#39;s perfect. I love that.</span></p><p class="c1 c8"><span class="c0"></span></p><div><p class="c8 c15"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p><a id="t.8c1b559901133d76d72352708d9b7577f50830d8"></a><a id="t.0"></a><table class="c3"><tbody><tr class="c17"><td class="c12" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c8 c14"><span class="c7 c10"></span></p></td><td class="c9" colspan="1" rowspan="1"><p class="c6"><span class="c7">Page </span><span class="c7">&nbsp;of </span></p></td></tr></tbody></table><p class="c14 c8"><span class="c10 c7"></span></p></div></body></html>
