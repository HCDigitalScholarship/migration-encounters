I don't know how to\n explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure\n that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the\n word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my\n mom trying to ask, \u201cWhat's wrong with her? What can they do?\u201d Doctors just\n going, \"She just needs birth control.

Are you\u2026\"\u2014A\n miscarriage, sorry, here it's abortion\u2014and it was just hard at that time\n because there was a lot of negligence also. For example, at the time I was\n still a virgin. And despite saying that I was not pregnant at all, there\n was no possible way, the doctors still examined me. And you know not being\n able to do anything legal for it because you couldn't, you're illegal. You\n can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be\n there. So it's always a lose-lose situation. So yeah, I would not say that\n it's comfortable being undocumented and needing healthcare.\n      "

It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,\n if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of\n good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to\n acknowledge that I was in a place that I could enjoy being in. So the first\n year adapting was just harsh. The second year onward after knowing, \"You\n know what, if you're going to be here, you might as well do something with\n your life,\" I said. That's when I started to look for a job, I started to\n make friends, but I honestly refused to speak Spanish for the first four\n years of being in Mexico.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Wow.\n      \n      \n Ana: So a lot of people sometimes, for example, my Spanish has gotten much\n better, but when I meet new people now, one of the first question tends to\n be, \"How long have you been in Mexico?\" \"I've been here 10 years.\" And\n they're surprised to why my Spanish is still... It's like, \"We can still\n tell you have an accent.\" Or when I get really nervous, my Spanish tends to\n fuck up. And they're just like, \"But you've been here 10 years.\" And it's\n kind of like, \"Yeah. Speaking Spanish, I've only done it for about six\n years.\"\n      \n      \n Isabel: Like been here?\n      \n      \n Ana: Right. So for me, just integrating into the culture, it's been baby\n steps, I think. I think that's how I describe it. Just from the steps of\n mourning, right? Acceptance, denial. Or I don't even know them in order,\n but for a whole long time, it was just denial and then acceptance and now\n really just flourishing into it.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And mourning, mourning your life in the US or?\n      \n      \n Ana: Mourning, I think more than anything, the loss of familiarity. I don't\n really remember my childhood to be honest. When I grew up here, I remember\n my grandparents and that's about it. So also adapting here in that sense,\n was really weird. People going up to you and going, \"Oh, I remember when\n you were so small.\" You would think that someone would appreciate that. You\n would think that, \"Hey, that's cute.\" And for me, because of the attitude\n that I had, for me it was just like, it was annoying. And it was like,\n \"You're a stranger to me. Why are you telling me about you knowing me, you\n don't know me.\" So, again, it was just really negative despite having\n people going to me and talking to me about my parents or talking to me\n about what they remember about my childhood. For me, it was not a welcome\n thing. So, it was, yeah. So, it was a mourning of the loss of familiarity.\n      "

And one of the things that for me has been\n really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very\n different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they\n are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up\n in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's\n to the point and it's not about just...\n \n \n Ana: For example, one of the things where I was discussing, previously or\n last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if\n I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up.

So I mean the\n immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things\n breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary\n was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,\n they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their\n case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,\n citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask\n them, \"If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, \"Well,\n you know, they deport you tomorrow.\" And I called my dad and I told him,\n \"Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be\n here. I'll sign my deportation.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that\n to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge\n and the judge told me, \u201cYou have a criminal charge in the United States and\n you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're\n considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.\u201d Those are the exact\n words that he said, \u201cYou are a threat to our citizens.\u201d And I told him,\n \"Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my\n brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this.\" And\n it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no\n emotion with him. It was, \"No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.\n But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: So it was like, \"Why are you giving me the option to fight my case\n if...[Sigh]\" So I told him, \"Okay, well let's sign.\" And literally the next\n day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be\n there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and\n literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on\n their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, \"If they can't\n do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?\" And that\n was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't\n be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.\n I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.\n      \n      \n Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way\n of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had\n to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want\n anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a\n father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be\n imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, \u201cNo,\u201d because there\n will be a lot of guards that would tell me, \"You're a dirty Mexican.\" And\n there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,\n \"Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his\n rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a\n criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal.\" And it was just so\n hard for me to stay focused on, \"No, you got to get out of this, you're\n going to get out of this.\"\n      \n      \n Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just\n explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much\n on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called\n something, it was just put your head down and, \"Okay, no, you're right.\"\n And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in\n immigration. It was just that, \"You're a dirty Mexican.\" And there was\n nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it\n was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,\n do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the\n way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself\n and I didn't mess what anybody.\n      "

She would always run around with me,\n she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she\n was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.\n So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, \"You know what,\n your son is doing this\" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and\n that's when I said, I told my mom, \"I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my\n father did, so I'm done.\" And that was it. That's when I said, \"I'm not\n going to do this again to my mom.\"\n  "

            "interview_part": " \n Angelo: I remember going to school, it was very scary for me because I\n didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The\n teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream\u2014I didn't know\n what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody\n what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and\n that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,\n to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but\n maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really\n introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,\n you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically\n like I had to learn everything by myself.\n      \n      \n Isabel: What did you have to learn? What was picking up the different\n cultural experiences like?\n      \n      \n Angelo: The main thing was learning how to interact with others, because it\n was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to\n people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would\n really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't\n do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted\n it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that\n belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my\n academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always\n told \"No, you're not American so you can\u2019t do that. And there's no way that\n you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way\n there, we're going to get pulled over.\u201d And so, I really didn't see a\n future there for me.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Where was that message coming from? Is it just your day to day\n interaction with people\u2014like the way you felt othered\u2014or did people\n explicitly say, \u201cYou have no opportunity here?\u201d\n      \n      \n Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to\n ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,\n we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home\n and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,\n didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't\n seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just\n that mindset that, \"Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and\n something bad might happen.\"\n      \n      \n Isabel: So definitely\u2026When I asked you the question, Do you fear the US\n authorities, that was a dominant part of your childhood?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Most definitely. Going to the United States from Mexico my dad\n still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had\n to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending\n because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left\n alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many\n times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or\n I would have a friend that said, \"Let's go do this,\" I'll be, \"No, I'm\n going to get in trouble.\" Or, \"No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from\n here.\" And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had\n Chicanos\u2014which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that\n were born there\u2014and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was\n always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, \"Oh I\n have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback.\" And so that was\n very, very, very difficult for me.\n "

We would just tell each other, \"No, you did good.\n It doesn't matter if you don't get the reward, it doesn't matter if you\n don't get the prize, you did it, you got that mail certificate.\" So it was\n just me and my sister.\n      \n      \n Isabel: So like in those situations, you might receive potential\n opportunities but like, no, you can't pursue them?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle\n school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.\n There was a point where one of my teachers\u2014one of my reading\n teachers\u2014basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching\n wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the\n book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.\n      \n      \n Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah. So\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: In what grade?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I\n feel like, \u201cOkay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're\n saying I'm doing good.\" And I'm sorry, what was the question?\n      \n      \n Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,\n like refusing those opportunities.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I\n got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front\n of a bunch of people. The website was legit\u2014it was if you search poetry on\n Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point\n where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate\n inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran\n around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that\n risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get\n deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes.\n      \n      \n Isabel: What was it about?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,\n yeah.\n      \n      \n Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you\n pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition\n for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that\n you can't go over.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that \"No, you can't.\"\n Basically, for me it was like, \u201cSo what's the point? So what am I working\n for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,\n what's the point?\u201d And I really never saw a future after middle school.\n "

            "interview_part": "\n Axel: Oh, yeah. I started getting in trouble, really, when I was at a\n younger age. When I was 10. That was when I first got into trouble. I had\n anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you\n know how they ask questions, everybody raises their hand to answer, and for\n some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising\n my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my\n family, my mom always moving around, I wanted to go with my dad, but my dad\n was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the\n moment.\n      \n      \n Axel: So I was just having my own personal issues and this teacher was\n always picking on me, and I had already told the truth. \"Look, the day that\n I have an answer, I'll raise my hand and I'll answer anything. I'll raise\n my hand. I do participate at some point. Right now, just I got some issues\n going on, let me just figure this out and no worries, I'm listening, I'm\n paying attention. Obviously, my qualifications are still good so I'm still\n AB type student.\" But I don't know.\n      \n      \n Axel: One day, he decided he wanted to pick on me again and I was like,\n that day, I was having one of the worst ones out of all them, and my anger\n just got the best of me and I physically assaulted my teacher. Since I was\n a minor at that time, they did take me to juvenile and they gave me\n probation for two years. When I was 12, I was supposed to be off but at a\n year and a half, a year and eight months, they told me they were going to\n give me a lie detector test, the polygraph test, which I was not aware of.\n      \n      \n Anne: About what?\n      \n      \n Axel: Just about to see if I was following my probation rules. I was going\n to probation hearings every Saturday. Every Saturday, I was going to\n meetings. It was anger management meetings slash checkups on you. Man, at a\n year, eight months, they told me they were going to do a... It was like,\n \"Just so we can go ahead and finalize, since you're almost over. We're just\n going to do a polygraph test.\" I heard about them and I heard that some\n people were like, \"Yeah, they don't really work.\" But I had my doubts about\n that. If they keep doing them, they probably do somehow work at some point.\n If they didn't work, I don't think people would keep using them. I know\n that the government's not that hurtful or they won't take that big of an\n advantage of people.\n      \n      \n Axel: So they did the lie detector test and I did keep on messing up. There\n were certain rules where I wasn't supposed to be drinking, I wasn't\n supposed to be outside of the house at certain hours, I had curfews. Since\n I was younger, I was considered a threat, since I had pretty much an\n assault charge on a teacher. I was considered a threat to some people\n younger me. Like two years or younger than me, I was considered a threat to\n all of them and I was around that type of people, but it was because my\n school had those type of people there. They understood that, but I was also\n hanging out with them in football games, which I wasn't supposed to be at\n because I was supposed to go from home to school and from school to home.\n If I had a job, then yeah, I could go to my job. They knew my hours.\n      \n      \n Anne: You were like 12?\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. I mean, I was there since we never had any official document,\n the way that we worked over there would be getting a fake ID with a fake\n name and everything. Fake ID, fake name, fake social security to work.\n      \n      \n Anne: And to get a license?\n      \n      \n Axel: Well, the license is a lot harder now, but I never got that at all.\n The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the\n car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,\n everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I\n at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never\n tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's\n something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they\n don't have one, and they're like, \"You'll never want to say that you don't\n have it. You just want to say you forgot it.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, \"Okay, next time, make sure you\n have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with\n you.\" Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take\n your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be\n driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you\n can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that\n fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You\n couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for\n legal...They actually ran the social security check.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh yeah, yeah.\n      \n      \n Axel: And that will, obviously, since it was a fake one, it didn't pass.\n They gave me just a number that looked legit, but it wasn't. If they ran it\n through, it'd be like, \"Oh, it fell, didn't go through. Maybe the number's\n wrong, can you double check it?\" And you're like, \"Okay, yeah, let me go\n ahead and double check it.\" And you just never go to that place again\n because you know they're going to check it, so you're just like, \"No, never\n mind. Let's try another place.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: As far as it goes when I started getting into trouble, I did my lie\n detector test, I failed it. Since I failed it, I had to go back to court to\n get reevaluated. Once I went back to court, they told me, \"Hey, well, you\n failed your lie detector test.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\" He's like, \"Well, look,\n out of the 10 questions, at least five of them, half of those, you lied on.\n You were doing this, you were doing this and this and this, and you weren't\n supposed to be doing it.\" He's like, \"So you're going to have to go before\n the judge again so he can see what we're going to have to do, if he's going\n to extend your probation or see what his judgment is.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: The first option they gave me was five years of jail time, and\n then...\n      \n      \n Anne: How old were you?\n      \n      \n Axel: I was 12 at that point, man. I was already 12. And they were offering\n me five years, and I was like...\n      \n      \n Anne: Five years of jail or juvenile?\n      \n      \n Axel: Juvenile. It was juvenile.\n      \n      \n Anne: It's sort of in jail.\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. They're pretty much the same. Besides the fact... The guards\n are a little bit nicer since they know you're underage, but...\n      \n      \n Anne: Only with juveniles?\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. But as far as the environment goes, it's still the same. Yeah,\n they offered me five years, I had a lawyer at that point in time too. My\n parents got me a lawyer and he didn't take the plea, and we fought it and\n fought it, and my second court, I was late due to traffic, and because of\n that, they told me that they were going to have to put me in custody\n because I was in flight risk. I was at risk of leaving the country or\n leaving the state and trying to avoid my problems.\n      \n      \n Axel: So they threw me in county and I was fighting my case while I was in\n county for about...\n      \n      \n Anne: You're 12 or 13?\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. I was 12. I was in county fighting my case, and I was fighting\n it for almost half a year. And it wasn't getting a resolution. We were\n trying to get an extension, we were trying to get maybe a ankle monitor,\n something of that sort to get out, because my parents didn't like the idea\n of me being in there because I was at risk also of not just the jail time\n or juvenile time, but the immigration catching up on it, and getting\n immigration.\n      \n      \n Axel: In the end, I've got a deal with the judge. They were going to extend\n my probation for another year. We got that deal on a Friday. By the time\n that the judge closed the deal and everything on my lawyer, it was already\n 4:30 in the afternoon. The probation office is closed at five. They were\n like, \"Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you\n have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so\n that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up\n here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation\n office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone\n number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already\n get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take\n your probation and you're already registered into it.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I was like, \"Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.\" I'm already signing the\n paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just\n got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend\n I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I\n know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it\n seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.\n      \n      \n Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular\n clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.\n Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except\n me. And they asked me, she's like, \"Hey, what are you waiting for?\" I'm\n like, \"I'm waiting for a probation officer too.\" So I looked up my name and\n everything and they were like, \"Oh, well, actually, it looks like\n immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.\n So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.\" He's like,\n \"But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way\n you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you\n don't have to meet some new people and stuff.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I'm like, I\u2019m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the\n people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really\n disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called\n my parents and my friends were like, \"Hey, are you out already? Where are\n you so we can go pick you up?\" I'm like, \"I'm inside my cell.\" And they're\n like, \"What, why?\" I was like, \"Apparently, immigration put a hold on me\n this morning at two, three in the morning so at six, when they took me out,\n they weren't aware. They changed me out of clothes and everything and then\n once everybody was gone and I was the only one left, they were like, why\n are you here still?\" And they were like, \"Oh well, it's because you have an\n immigration hold, blah, blah, blah, so we're going to have to take you back\n in.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: So here we go again, fighting my case, trying to take another two,\n three months. Just so that they offered me five years again and they were\n trying to go down to three. Three and some probation. And then at the end,\n when my judge got the deal where they were like, \"Okay, this is what we're\n going to do. We're going to give you a misdemeanor charge and a felony, and\n you're only going to do two years.\"\n      \n      \n Anne: But you didn't do anything. You've been in jail all this time.\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. They're like, \"We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of\n a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed\n your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your\n probation.\" He's like, \"Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile\n for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you\n therapy sessions for anger management.\" He's like, \"They also talk about\n drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,\n so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your\n personal sessions also to help you with your issues.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: And I was like, \"Can I do that outside with ankle monitors? At least\n you'll know exactly where I'm at and you'll know if I leave the house,\n anything like that.\" \"No, no. Those options aren't available for you.\" He's\n like, \"The option is just that. We can do that or you can try taking your\n court case to trial. Which is not really recommended.\" Even my lawyer told\n me it wasn't really recommended. So I took the plea. I did my two years in\n juvie, got out when I was almost 15, and everything for me was brand new\n again. The whole city, a lot has changed, some new bridges, new streets,\n new everything was a little bit different in two years.\n      \n      \n Anne: Did you go back to school?\n      \n      \n Axel: Yeah. I went back to school. I went back to the same school that I\n used to go. Everybody was like, \"Where were you last two years?\""

Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers\n to hire new arrivals.\n      \n      \n Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of\n assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in\n monetary assistance or vouchers, something.

One of the\n things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take\n 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't\n have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they\n have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out\n of people as long as they're dumping people right there.

But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go\n to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those\n are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All\n these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses\n are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait\n until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they\n catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there\u2019s gotta be\n something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about\n any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest\n of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would\n probably save them a lot of money\u2014it'd probably save them more to get them\n home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to\n where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos\n that's going on right now.\n"

Not in the next 30%, the ones that maybe\n     because of here they just were immigrants, and they were poor. I mean, I'm\n     not saying that I was rich, I was poor too. But I mean they were having a\n     hard time here in Mexico. Probably they were trying to find out what they\n     were going to do with their lives. Even though we were kids, we knew like,\n     \"I don't like this, this Chicano, this gang member thing.\" I was invited\n     many times to join them because of discrimination with them. I never had\n     this bad experience with an American telling me, \"You're a wetback.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     No, I had the bad experience with Chicanos telling me I'm a wetback, and I\n     had a lot of fights there. I used to tell them, \"You know what? I'm a\n     wetback, but guess what? I know what I am. I'm Mexican. You don't know what\n     you are. You don't know. Tell me what you are, and I\u2019ll respect you.\" That\n     got me into a lot of trouble, a lot of trouble because that's what my mom\n     told me. \"They don't know what they are. You know what you are. You're\n     Mexican. They don't know.\" She taught me about it. \u201cYou know, they go to\n     Dodger Stadium, they're Americans, hotdogs, beer, all this.

At a call center you turn out to be friends with everybody. For\n     example, I left a lot of friends at some other call centers. If I move on\n     for better pay, we just move to another call center and verify if they\n     actually pay good.

I\u2019ve\n     even waited 15 days or if he just got in, for example, on the 5th of a\n     specific month, I have to wait because they don't get paid exactly on the\n     15th.

You rotate\n     time to time. That's how we communicate through this networking as you call\n     it. \"I'm here, I'm at TeleTech, come here, there's a brand-new account and\n     they're going to be paying good.\" That's how we travel around.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Let's say you\u2019re in TeleTech or you're in one place and some place opens\n     and it's a new account that pays better.

It's like somebody is crying wolf. \"Let's\n     go,\" and eventually they all leave. I mean they say, \"I'm sorry\" but I\n     don't know what exactly happens. I've seen companies that, for example,\n     there was a brand-new place, an AT&amp;T. As soon as they opened, everybody\n     took off. The call center got empty.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     The other call center?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     The other call center was empty. They started setting up advertisements\n     everywhere. \"Hey, we need people, we need people.\" But that's how it is.\n     That's basically what we want is really, we're trying to get a place with\n     stability and a good pay.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     Do the other call centers raise their pay?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Not the call center, there are accounts that pay good.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     But the ones that lose when everybody runs off to AT&amp;T and leaves their\n     other jobs. Do the other call centers sometimes increase their pay to\n     retain?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     No. No. I guess we talk about it. You asked me about what happens to the\n     new immigrants that come here. They're the ones that come on to take our\n     place because they don't know what's going on. They just, \"Oh, a call\n     center. I'm going to get 2000 pesos, I don't know, every two weeks.\" It's\n     good because they are new immigrants. Even if we know about it, and they\n     become our friends for a little while before we move on to the other call\n     center. We let them know, \"You know what? Why don't you come with us?\" But\n     they're afraid. \"No, I need to get experience.\" As soon as they get\n     experience, \"What was I thinking? What happened in my head that I was stuck\n     right here?\" That's what they do, and then they call us up. \"Hey, do you\n     think they're still hiring?\" \"Yes. Come over.\"\n \n \n "

I learned the hard way because my dad\n     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was\n     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody\n     was like, \"The new guy\" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And\n     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL\n     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I\n     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had\n     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that\n     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was\n     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state.

But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts\n     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. \"Huh?\n     Okay.\" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. \"Okay. I heard about him.\"\n     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, \"Blah, blah, blah,\n     blah, blah.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Okay and I understood \u201cAbraham Lincoln,\u201d and that\u2019s all. \"Abraham Lincoln.\"\n     \"Good.

Schools are like\u2013 they do have certain stuff going on with gang\n     related things and country stuff, and they wanted us to be part of them.\n     Whenever an American would say something or do something, we're together,\n     but we actually said, \"No.\" We're good friends. But that's it.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     You had a strong home environment. Your mother and father were there?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Yes, yes.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     They were happy?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     They were happy because they didn't know what I was going through. I never\n     told them my experiences at school because of the respect I have. I knew if\n     I would tell them something that I was going through, because of Mexican\n     culture before, they were very strict. I was afraid of telling them, \"You\n     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties\"\n     because my dad would tell me, \"You're just going to study. That's why\n     you're going. You're just going to study. Don't pay attention to anything,\n     and I don't want you to do anything stupid. You're to go to school and\n     that's it.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I knew his answer already. I knew what he was going to tell me, so I just\n     decided just to continue with my stuff. Now that I'm older. We have this\n     conversation. I had this conversation with him. \"Did you know about me\n     having these difficulties with Chicanos, with black people? Did you know\n     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?\" \"No. How\n     come you didn't tell me?\" \"Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was\n     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,\n     you, you were not going to take me back to Mexico because we were already\n     here.\" He's like, \"I didn't know.\"\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     How did you resist becoming a gang member?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I resisted because I really didn't like it. Because of the culture here in\n     Mexico, you don't fight for a street. Don't fight for a street. We fight, I\n     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not\n     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, \"Oh, that's your\n     street? You own it? Go for it.\" I'm like, \"It's your street? What about the\n     street? That's good.\n \n \n  "

But the food, the American stuff,\n     the things I used to do early in the morning like to go to this American\n     restaurant and ask for my hash browns, my bacon, jar of orange juice and a\n     coffee, it\u2019s just amazing. The cook was my friend and, he knew me already.\n     \"Hey Beto.\" \"Hey my friend. Same?\" It was amazing. Something that we don't\n     have here. Something that's missing here when you go in, the way they treat\n     you, it's beautiful.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     What do you mean the way they treat you?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Like they always smile at you.

Now\n     I know why Starbucks puts your name on the little thing because by putting\n     your name, it's like you are part of this place. They make you feel like\n     you are part of that specific restaurant. Not like what you see in the\n     movies. But I had a lot of restaurants where I used to go in, and they were\n     all my friends and they told me here, \"Why don't you change your name when\n     you, when you make- \" \"I don't have to, everybody knows Beto.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     I go, they know Beto everywhere.

[Singing] \u201cWell I guess you wondering\n where I'd been. I searched to find the love within. In my world only you\n make me do for love, girl, what I would not do. My friends wonder what is\n wrong with me, but I'm in a daze.\" Alright. That's it.\n      \n      \n Anita: That's pretty cool.\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, I'm sorry for doing that just, I have to burst out and sing.\n      \n      \n Anita: Yeah, no that was great. That was fantastic. So, as you can tell,\n Billy is a musician.\n      \n      \n Billy: I love music, I love to sing. It's just... it's like a form of\n therapy for me. Yeah. It really is.\n      \n      \n Anita: Do you sing Mexican stuff or just...?\n      \n      \n Billy: You know what, it's embarrassing because a lot of people tell me,\n \"Oh, sing this Jose, Jose song or Mexican traditional songs,\u201d and I don't\n know them and so it's like, \"Bro, I'm sorry. I don't know it.\" I only play\n grandpa music.\n      \n      \n Anita: But it's grandpa American music?\n      \n      \n Billy: It's American music history and if it wasn't for that there wouldn't\n be a lot of genres today. I really like that old stuff, for sure.\n      \n      \n Anita: And how did you get exposed to that old stuff?\n      \n      \n Billy: So, that was in North Carolina. I was actually going through a\n really big depression. I didn't know what to do anymore, being illegal in\n the U.S, not being able to find jobs, not being able to go into college was\n difficult for me so I was falling into a depression. And then I came across\n this guy called Robert Johnson. Robert Johnson is the king of the Delta\n blues. He's one of the most important American musicians, ever.\n      \n      \n Billy: So, I started listening to his music and just the pain and the story\n of him uplifted me. He was letting me know, \"You know what, you're healthy.\n You're young. Look at these African American people back in the day, what\n they went through and compared to what you're going through? Don't be a\n sissy and don't complain.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So that music just uplifted me, and it gave me energy and it let me\n know, \"Bro, you don't have to just be this kid with\u201d\u2014because I had a lot of\n anxiety\u2014\"This kid with anxiety. You can play music and make people feel\n good.\" And so that helped me out a lot and eventually that led me to, and\n this is going to sound weird but, it led me to discover the purpose of what\n a human is because, listen to this, when you play music, you're helping\n other people out, right? And you're really contributing to the change that\n you want to live in the future.\n      \n      \n Billy: And I was, like, \"Dude, what's the purpose of a human being? Why are\n we here?\" And it's simply to help others. That's all it is. It is to\n contribute to the change you want to live in and it's very fulfilling when\n you help somebody. And so that let me know, \"Dude, you're here to help\n others and, yeah, just do it.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: And jazz helped me discover that because it's like a chain. African\n American people help each other out through their music, that helped other\n people out, that helped me out. Eventually I took my friend out of a heroin\n addiction because of that, because of the music. And I started crying when\n he told me. He was like, \"Dude, I just wanted to thank you because you took\n me out of my heroin addiction.\" I actually did something. So that music was\n really important for me. It gave me an identity.\n  "

            "interview_part": " This audio has two different parts of the interview:   1)  \n Anita: Did you face discrimination at all in the States?\n      \n      \n Billy: Let me think about that. No, never. Never.\n      \n      \n Anita: What about here?\n      \n      \n Billy: That's something that I always thought about like, \"Dude, I never\n went through racism in the U.S., but I saw my brother go through it, so I\n understood it.\"\n      \n      \n Anita: Was your brother... what is it your brother-\n      \n      \n Billy: My brother, he looks like me, you get me? He has the nose, speaks\n like me, he has the characteristics but he's darker and he has brown eyes.\n And I remember my friends would play around, \"Oh, Mexican. Or we're going\n to go back to LA man,\" and they would mock him. They never did that to me.\n And, as a matter of fact, this one white guy, he was like, \"Man to me\n you're white, bud. To me you're white, bud.\" So, I never went through that.\n I don't know why.\n      \n      \n Anita: So, did African Americans discriminate against you?\n      \n      \n Billy: Especially them, they're not going to discriminate. They go through\n that every day. So, they're not going to do that. But they would be like,\n \"Dude, I know you ain't fully white, you got black in you, don't you? You\n got black, huh?\" I'm going like, \"Yeah, man I got black, bro, I got black.\"\n And then I would sing the blues so they would be like, \"Yeah man, you got\n black, man, for sure.\u201d [Anita laughs]. You're like, \u201c[Singing] She don't\n even want it maybe,\" that type of music and so they feel it bro, they\n really feel it.\n   2)   \n Anita: Yeah. So, racism here, have you felt it?\n      \n      \n Billy: Over here it's not about racism. Over here it's about money. Over\n here if you have good shoes and good pants, that's your stature. In the\n U.S. it's about color. If you're white and tall you can do whatever you\n want [Chuckle]. No, I'm just kidding. But here it\u2014\n      \n      \n Billy: Here it's about money, okay? It\u2019s about your economic situation.\n Because Mexico is such an old country and the economic situation's not that\n good. You know if you have Jordans it's like, \"Whoa man. This dude has\n Jordans.\" In the U.S., it's like, \"Yeah, I got Jordans. So what?\" So here\n it's about money. You could be ugly or whatever, you're going to have a\n pretty girl.\n      \n      \n Billy: In the U.S. it's more about race, obviously because of the history\n between the black and the white. It\u2019s about race. If you're a tall white\n guy with green eyes, I'm telling you, it's so stupid, you get so many\n opportunities.\n      \n      \n Anita: I know.\n      \n      \n Billy: And so, that's what I would say.\n      \n      \n Billy: They're living in a country which is not first world like the U.S.,\n and they know that themselves. They know that, okay, this is a dude that's\n coming from\u2014I forgot the word, my dad told me\u2014a more privileged country,\n obviously. And so, people here, dude even when they look at American TV\n shows they're very involved in that culture.\n      \n      \n Billy: So, I've never gone through like, \"Oh, go back to the U.S.,\" as a\n matter of fact, they're like, \"Dude, how is the U.S. bro? I've always\n wanted to go. I want to see California.\" So, never any racism. Maybe people\n that are jealous, for example, I've been on the Metro and like this dude is\n with his girl. He starts making out with his girl. He\u2019s like, \"Bro relax\n man. I'm not going to take your girl. Have a little self-esteem, you know?\"\n Or when I'm buying a Gatorade, they charge me 22 pesos instead of 15.\n      \n      \n Anita: Because they think you're American.\n      \n      \n Billy: Because they think that I'm American or something. I'll be like,\n \"Hey, can I get a Gatorade?\" They're like, \u201cque es eso? No tenemos eso\u201d.\n [what\u2019s that?] I say, \u201cSe\u00f1ora que est\u00e1 hablando, alla hay un Gatorade atr\u00e1s\n de usted\u201d Oh eso se llama G-A-T-O-R-A-D-E mi hijo, no podemos tener [Ma\u2019am\n what are you talking about, there is one behind you. Oh that, that is\n called G-A-T-O-R-A-D-E my son, so we don\u2019t have] -- So yeah, stuff like\n that but not any racism. Like stuff like, \"Oh, go back to America you\n fucking gringo,\" nothing like that. Excuse my language.\n "

What I'm trying to figure out is, is there a certain stage of\n your life where all of a sudden you realized that it was different for you?\n      \n      \n Billy: Oh yeah, for sure. For sure. When my dad started telling me, \"Bro,\n if you get arrested, you're going to get deported,\" and when he started\n telling me, \"If you don't finish school, you're not going to do anything.\n You're going to be the illegal migrant working construction.\" And so, when\n I started, I was like, \"Oh man, this means that I'm like them.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: I am a Mexican right? And so, it's like, \"Dude, you're American but\n you're not? This was crazy!\u201d and so right there I was like, \"Dude, what am\n I?\" At one point I was like, \"Dude, what am I? Am I...?\" Not in terms of\n who I am, in personality, but my nationality. I was like, \"Am I American or\n am I Mexican?\" Eventually I just said I was Mexican. That's my nationality,\n that's where I was born but I had an experience in the U.S. you hear me?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, it's just like, because people are like, \"Bro, are you white?\"\n I don't like saying I'm white because I'm not white. It's like, \"I'm not\n white, Bro, I'm Mexican.\" They're like, \"How are you Mexican, man? How do\n you speak English like that?\" It's like, \"Yeah, man. I'm Mexican. It's\n cool, bro, it's cool.\"\n      \n      \n Anita: So, you said you were Mexican. Why did you say you were Mexican?\n      \n      \n Billy: Just because I couldn't say I was white. What am I going to say? I'm\n white? No, I'm Mexican. But at first, I thought I was white. I was like,\n \"Dude, you're just a skater kid. You're American.\" Then after I started...\n My dad told me, \"Dude, if you get arrested, that's going to be an issue.\"\n That's when I realized, \"Bro, you're Mexican, dude, and this is part of\n you. This is part of your roots. Just be proud of it. Grab it and be proud\n of it.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: So now I'm proud to be Mexican and it's awesome because when a white\n guy thinks I'm white and I start speaking Spanish he's like, \"Whoa man, I\n didn't know Mexicans could do all that.\" And it's like, \"Yeah, bro. Yeah,\n man. I'm here to show that. I'm an example.\" So now I'm even more proud of\n being Mexican.\n      \n      \n Anita: So, at what age do you remember that? What age did your father tell\n you these things?\n      \n      \n Billy: Oh, he started telling me this when I was 15.\n      \n      \n Anita: 15?\n  2)  \n Billy: You know what? I am American but I'm also very Mexican. If you hear\n me talking Spanish, I'm very like, from the city and got not much\u2014\n      \n      \n Anita: You can do it?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah. I'm a Mexican boy dude.\n      \n      \n Anita: So, I'm going to ask you both these questions. In what way do you\n feel American?\n      \n      \n Billy: The fact that I understand the culture. The fact that I grew up in\n African American neighborhoods and lived the whole American experience. Not\n just that but I had friends from all over. Friends from Cuba, living in\n Miami. From Columbia. Then I had Asian friends, white friends, black\n friends. I got into the skateboarding culture which really introduced me to\n a big part of American life. Going out and filming with your friends.\n Learning jazz music showed me the history of the U.S. and why African\n American history is so important\u2014it really, in a way, shaped what the U.S.\n is.\n      \n      \n Billy: And so, in those ways I consider myself American. Just those\n experiences. But blood-wise, I'm Mexicano [Anita laughs]. Culturally and in\n terms of my roots I'm Mexican. I've been exposed to the tacos al pastor. I\n would give my friends Agua de Jamaica in the U.S. and they were like, \"Man,\n what is this, bro? Man, what is this juice?\" I'm like, \"Bro, this is not\n juice it's a plant.\" It's like, \"Man, this is good, bro. I got to buy\n this.\" And stuff like that. I've been exposed to the Mexican culture, yeah.\n"

I\n just remember he would call, and he would say like, \u201cAre you going to be\n good? You sure you guys want to come over there?\u201d Because my mom still\n wasn't very sure if she wanted to move over there.\n      \n      \n Brenda: I loved my dad so I was like, \"Yes, I will.\" It's like, \u201cYou have\n to learn English and you have to do all this stuff.\u201d I'd be like, \u201cYeah, of\n course I will learn it.\" So, I would go all around the house speaking mumbo\n jumbo\u2014no one understood\u2014thinking it was English. I was like, \u201cI'm\n practicing my English for when I get there with my dad.\u201d So, me being like,\n \u201cMom, you have to go, we have to go!\u201d Ended up with my mom being like, \"All\n right let's go.\"\n      \n      \n Brenda: We crossed the border and I don't remember feeling any shock or\n anything. I remember getting there and I think my mom had gotten behind at\n some crossing. So, we got there a little bit before her and my dad took us\n grocery shopping. I remember my brother and I being like, \"Oh we eat all of\n these cereals\" and they were brand names cereals and my mom would never buy\n us multiple cereals.\n      \n      \n Brenda: He was like, \"Okay, are you guys serious?\" Like, \"Yes, we eat all\n of those.\" \u201cAll of those?\u201d \u201cShe buys us five cereals every time we go to\n the grocery store so you can buy those as well.\u201d It was like, \u201cAll right.\u201d\n So, I just remember being like, \"Oh my gosh, this is so nice.\" Everything\n was, it seemed at least I think in my head, cleaner and I was with my dad\n and we were all together.

I'm always looking for something to do, hang out with friends. At\n   least just to talk. I don't like being inside of the house. I like being\n   out and about.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You feel like you're in prison if you\u2019re at home?\n \n \n   Cris: Yeah, because after being locked up, whenever I'm in my room, I don't\n   even sleep with my door closed.

I'm scared of the dark.\n \n \n   Lizzy: And that's just since being locked up?\n \n \n   Cris: Well, I've been scared of the dark since I was a kid. But since being\n   locked, I'm scared of being with shut doors, I'm scared to be by myself.\n   The two days out of the whole four months that I've been staying at this\n   new place that I've been there by myself for like an hour or two. Man I go\n   crazy and I just go walk around the neighborhood because I can't. I just\n   get really sad.\n \n \n   Lizzy: And when were you locked up?\n \n \n   Cris: June 12, 2015, is when I got to Oklahoma City County Jail.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So, let's back up just a tiny bit.\n \n \n   Cris: Okay, yeah sorry I'm just\u2014\n \n \n   Lizzy: No, that's okay. How did you end up there? What happened?\n \n \n   Cris: Okay, so I'm going to try to say this. I hate saying this but okay.\n \n \n   Cris: I've always been a hard-working man. I woke up same routine as every\n   day, but this day I forgot to pee before I left home, so I pull into the\n   gas station\u2014I'm on my way to work, it\u2019s 4:30, I'm at the gas station\n   already. I pulled in a little too fast and I hit my brakes and I'm, \"Oh,\n   crap.\u201d But I park. There's all these Mexicans. Everybody else is there too.\n   Everybody else going to work getting their coffee. I hit the front door and\n   I open it for some people. And then I hear him and he's like \"Driver, stay\n   where you are.\" And I look over at him but he's busy with his radio so I'm\n   maybe he's talking to somebody else. So I grab the door and I walk in and\n   he's, \"I said stay right where you are.\" And he's holding his gun.\n \n \n   Cris: And I'm like, \"Whoa officer, you don't have to do this.\" I was,\n   \"What's going on here?\" He was like, \"I told you to stay where!\u201d He's\n   cussing, \"Stay where the fuck you're at.\" Okay officer. I was, \"I'm abiding\n   by everything you're telling me, what's going on here? What's going on? I\n   haven't done anything.\" He was like, \"That's for me to decide.\" He goes,\n   \"I'm investigating a crime that happened around here and you fit the\n   description.\" I was like, \"Officer, with all due respect, that's a pretty\n   dumb statement because I'm just same as all the other Mexicans in here.\" I\n   was like, \"Look at us, we're all in fluorescent shirts, blue jeans, and\n   work boots.\" I was like, \"Why you don't grab anybody else? How come it's\n   just me?\" He goes, \"Like I said, you let me deal with this. You let me\n   worry about the rest of the guys. Right now I'm focused on you.\" He goes\n   \"What's your name?\" I tell him my name. Looks me up, He's \"I can't find\n   you.\" I was like \u201cYeah because I don't have a criminal record. I've had\n   traffic violations but that's it.\u201d He's like, \"Naw, you're lying to me.\"\n \n \n   Cris: So you know it turns out I did give him my right name but they needed\n   my fingerprint. When my fingerprint came up, I had a warrant that he\n   couldn't see with just my name. He had to have my fingerprint. I had sent\n   my buddy to pay off a traffic ticket that I had got three weeks before that\n   for the same thing. Well he didn't pay it off. He pocketed some of the\n   money.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Your friend did?\n \n \n   Cris: Yeah. So that's why I had the warrant. But that's not why he deported\n   me. Or why he arrested me. He arrested me because the fingerprint guy, the\n   guy that came with the fingerprint scanner, he was really racist. And he\n   grabbed me, he twisted me up and everything. He was like, \"You want to\n   fucking play smart with me?\" He's cussing up and down. And I'm like,\n   \"Officer, I don't know why you're doing this but go ahead. You could have\n   just asked me I would have put my hand out there.\" I was like, \" You don't\n   have to do all this. What's wrong with you?\" And then he's putting his hand\n   on the back of my neck. He's like, \"I told you to shut the fuck up.\"\n \n \n   Cris: And I was, \u201cOkay officer.\u201d So, then it turns out I had a bench\n   warrant for failure to appear in court for a traffic violation. I'm like,\n   \u201cNo that's not right.\u201d I always pay off my traffic tickets. And he looks at\n   the picture because they don't have a picture of me since I was a teenager.\n   That's the only time I've been to Juvy. I had my own car by then so they\n   though I stole it because it wasn't in my name\u2014it was in my dad's friend's\n   name. But after he proved it wasn't stolen and everything it was good. But\n   they did take me to Juvy. The CIC, it's not Juvy. So they take your picture\n   and everything. So, they are like, \"That's not him.\" I was like, \u201cPlease\n   think that's not me. I hope they really think that's not me because it was\n   me.\u201d\n \n \n   Cris: And they're like, \"He don't have the tattoos.\" Because I didn't have\n   tattoos when I was a teenager. And then out of nowhere he's like, \"Just\n   take him in. We'll just figure it out in there.\" And that's how they took\n   me in. That guy he told him. And the other guy was like, \"Man, I really\n   wish I could help you right now. Because I'm not going to write you tickets\n   for no insurance. I'm just going to write you a ticket for no driver\u2019s\n   license. That's it. I'm not going to get you for suspended or nothing like\n   that. Just no driver's license. I really wish I could help you.\" I was\n   like, \"At the end of the day, man you're doing nothing wrong. I can tell\n   just by looking at you you're not a bad person. You're investigating a\n   crime, I get it. But you're a part of this so I'm just going to pray for\n   you. It's not your fault. God knows it's not your fault.\" And he's just\n   sitting there and he's like, \"Man.\"\n \n \n   Cris: Because I told him, I was, \"Literally what y\u2019all doing right now,\n   y\u2019all separating a family. Even though I'm not legally from here, because\n   I'm going to be completely honest with you officer. I'm an illegal\n   immigrant. I'm here illegally.\" And then he said, \"Well, how you working?\"\n   I was like, \"Well, I'm an illegal immigrant, you can answer that by\n   yourself right?\" And he's like, \"Yeah, I get it.\" \"So you know what you're\n   doing right now, you're separating.\" And I'm crying this whole time.\n   \"You're separating a family. My daughters are going to be without a dad. My\n   wife is going to be at home waiting on her husband to call her. She's going\n   to be worried sick.

I mean, because at the end of the day, if somebody doesn't\n   come out and speak out about the real situations, everybody's always going\n   to think, \u201cAh, it's whatever you know. Deportation is just... They can come\n   back illegally.\u201d\n \n \n   Cris: They don't realize that, yes, we have that option. But what risks\n   come behind that? Three to five years in a federal prison? No, thank you.\n   No, no, thank you. And people think, \"Oh, everybody that gets deported is\n   either a murderer or something. Somebody that's out there gun slinging, and\n   doing all this crazy stuff.\" And I'm living proof that not all of us are\n   like that. There's actually real hardworking... I was a real hardworking,\n   blue collar American, and I consider myself American. It's just that piece\n   of paper that says I'm not American. That's the only thing that separates\n   me from everybody else back home.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I was going to ask you about that because the vast majority of your\n   life was in the U.S. Do you consider yourself Mexican?\n \n \n   Cris: No, I don't. Yes, I know that my roots are Mexican and they're\n   indigenous. But in my heart, my culture is America. I love America. I feel\n   American. Everything that I did back home I was... I was out there, you\n   know? I hardly hung around Mexicans. That's why my Spanish is so bad. I\n   mostly hung around with black folk, white folk, and native American folk.\n   So, I was always in the country fishing, hunting, going mudding, noodling\n   in the Oklahoma rivers.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wait, noodling?\n \n \n   Cris: That's when you catch catfish, monster catfish, with your hands.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Okay, can you walk me through this a little bit more? [Laughs].\n \n \n   Cris: Okay, so what you do, you go into the red rivers and the muddy\n   rivers. It has to be a muddy river. It can't be a rocky one because catfish\n   don't do that. They don't got to pick up rocks. So, you go into the muddy\n   rivers barefoot, and you feel around you, you dive down, like I'm standing\n   up though and you feel around for holes. Once you find a hole, you know\n   there's a catfish in there, so you go up and you let your boys know, \"Hey\n   man, I got one,\" so they can pull you out just in case the suckers too big.\n   So, take a deep breath\u2014 I'm really good at swimming, by the way. I can hold\n   my breath for three and a half minutes, almost four minutes.\n"

You did what you had to do. You did your part. It's not\n   your fault you can't go back. In a way it is, but at the end of the day,\n   no, not really. Because if you could, you could just go back illegally. But\n   what would that cause if I get pulled over? They put me in prison for\n   re-entry, and they told me I would get three to five years if they catch me\n   in the country again, so I'm not risking that. No.\u201d\n \n \n   Cris: I mean, I know at first, I didn't care. I was like, \u201cI'll deal with\n   the time. I want to go back.\u201d But I give her all my money, so I was waiting\n   for my family to save up. By the time they saved up the money, I was\n   already here, and I was like, \"You know what? Let me give it a try.\" I\n   liked it. I loved it, and I'm here. I'm here to stay. I don't want to go\n   home. And my mom cries every time she tells me, she's like, \"Come on, just\n   come back.\" And I always tell my mom, \"Please don't talk about that.\" And\n   she'd said, \"Why?\" And then she'd start crying. She said, \"But why? Why?\" I\n   was like, \"Because I just don't want to talk about it.\" She said, \"But\n   what? When do you want to come home?\"\n \n \n   Cris: And she was like, \"So I can pay them. So, I can tell them.\" I'm like,\n   \"Mom, that's the thing. I don't want to go home. I'm sorry, I just don't\n   want to go home.\" And then that's whenever she starts talking to me like\n   that, and I'm like, \"I'm sorry. You know I'm sorry.\" She's like, \"At least\n   if you're not going to do it for me, do it for your children.\" I'll say, \"I\n   am doing it for my kids.\" I was like, \"What good am I to them in prison? At\n   least over here, one day when they're old enough, they can get a phone.\"\n \n \n   Cris: Because my older daughter, she calls me. It's been like a year since\n   she hasn't called me, but she would call me hiding from her mom. She's\n   like, \"Hey, Daddy.\" I'm like, \"Daniella?\" She's like, \"Yes, it's me. Just\n   don't talk too loud. My mom's asleep, and she's in the living room with her\n   boyfriend. If she hears me talk, she's going to take the phone away.\" She\n   says, \"I miss you, Daddy.\" And I'm like, \"I miss you, too.\" She's like,\n   \"When are you going to come back close so we can be a family again?\" And it\n   breaks my heart when she says that. I hate it when she sees that because\n   it's like, God, she doesn't understand. I wish she could\n   understand.[crying]\n \n \n   Cris: She's so innocent, and she's says, \"I miss you, Daddy. I love you.\"\n   \"I love you, too, Daniela. I think about you every day. I miss you.\" And\n   then she'd say, \"When are you going to come home?\" I told her, I said,\n   \"Well, it's going to be a while, baby, but I'll be home one day.\" She was\n   like, \"Are you going to come? Are you going to come next week? In two\n   weeks?\" It just breaks my heart\u2014\n \n \n   Lizzy: Ah, that's how kids think.\n \n \n   Cris: And I'm like, \"No baby. Baby, it's going to be a little bit longer. I\n   have to be here for a little bit.\" She said, \"But you're not in jail?\" I\n   said, \"No, I'm not in jail no more, baby. I'm in Mexico.\" She said, \"I can\n   go to Mexico. I have papers.\" I was like, \"Yeah baby, but you know your\n   mom.\" She said, \"Yeah.\" She's like, \"Well, you can tell your mom, my\n   grandma to pick me up.\" But her mom doesn't let her. She doesn't like my\n   family. So, she always says, \"Well, do you promise when you get back, we're\n   going to be a family again? You and Mommy?\" And I don't have the heart to\n   tell her no.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Yeah, what do you say to her?\n \n \n   Cris: I tell her, \"Yeah.\" I was like, \"Yeah, baby. Me and your mommy will\n   be together.\" She said, \"You're going to get married this time?\" \"Yeah,\n   we'll get married.\" She's like, \"Yay!\" And that was the last I talked to\n   her. After she said, \"Yay,\" I don't know but I hear Brenda. She's like,\n   \"What the F are you doing? Give me that effing phone.\" And she said, \"No,\n   no, Daddy, Daddy,\" and then clicks.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So, she's gone.\n \n \n   Cris: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: That was a year ago?\n \n \n   Cris: That was a year ago.

You make this\n   house what it is. Your energy. Because everybody else is more serious.\u201d I'm\n   not going to lie, two of them used to be gangsters and they still have that\n   mentality.

No, since I got here, obviously the first year was bad, but\n   once I got here to Mexico City I feel like I'm actually free because now I\n   have things in my name. I have a job with my real name. [Laughs]. I don't\n   have to use a fake social and stuff. I'm legal here, I don't have to hide\n   anymore. For me this is a fresh start at life. This is how I should have\n   felt back home.

I'm sorry.\"\\ It\n   might make me seem like a deadbeat dad, I don't know what it's going to\n   make me seem like. I don't know how people are going to see this but I\n   don't want to go home. I miss you mom, I love you.\u201d Because I've been a\n   mommas boy all my life. I love my mom to death.

Oh, I don't know. I just feel like I'm trapped in it.\n   I don't know. It's weird.\n"

So, I look\n   like I'm from this side, like a Cholos.\n \n \n   Cris: People always go to \"Hey, where you from?\u201d I'm like, \"I'm from\n   Puebla, but I lived in Oklahoma.\" They're like, \"Nah, where you from\n   Homie?\u201d I'm like, \"I was raised I'm Oklahoma.\u201d They're like \"Quit acting\n   stupid, Homie.

Because when I was a teenager, I\n   started hanging out with gangs just to fit in. I got out of it like a year\n   later, because I realized it wasn't for me. But yeah, everybody that's in\n   there is either because their dads are in prison or their dad, or they left\n   them. And they feel comfortable around their homies to where they feel like\n   they're their brothers and they look up to them.\n \n \n   Cris: In all honesty, people will probably tell you something else, but\n   they're just trying to cover the fact that it's because of the absence of a\n   father. Or lack of attention from their mother sometimes. Like me, my mom\n   was always too busy working. So I would get suspended from school, I walk\n   down the block and there goes the big homies. The big homies. [Chuckle].\n   And they're like, \"Hey man, come over here. Hang out with us.\u201d One thing\n   leads to another, but that's how it starts: lack of attention at home.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Needing a role model\u2014\n \n \n   Cris: There you go.\n \n \n   Lizzy: An older figure.\n \n \n   Cris: That's what it's all about.

I know for a fact that's what it is\n   because everybody that I knew that was my age hanging out with them\n   gangsters, they were there for the same thing.

I remember that it was around three\n     in the morning. See the three, see the significance of the threes. It\n     was around three in the morning actually when I woke up. It was a\n     nightmare to me at the time it was very hurtful seeing myself in the\n     window because since the airplane, the lights were on, I looked at\n     myself and it was like the mirror reflection because the lights, I saw\n     myself and I was like, damn, this is for real.

So, I'm landing, right?\n     When I look out from the window, I look and I see a tiny little bright\n     light in a sea of darkness, just somber, quiet, darkness. And I see\n     this super, super bright light in the distance. Super far away. I'm\n     like, what is that tiny dot? What is that? Why is it so bright? What's\n     going on? Where am I arriving? Why is it so light in a sea of darkness?\n     So about 30 minutes go by, 3:30, I start seeing how that tiny light\n     becomes a monstrosity, just huge city, far away. This beacon of light\n     just shining out to me, and I'm like, I think I'm here. I think I'm\n     actually here.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Suddenly, I started feeling dreadful. I started feeling a\n     dread, just very anxious, very nervous, very sad, very, just, I don't\n     know, just a rush of emotions. Just going through my head just like, Uh\n     oh, I think I'm here. I think I'm here. I think I\u2019m here.This is really\n     happening. I started feeling very nervous, very\u2026 it's even hard to\n     describe what I was feeling. It was intense. It was so intense. I was\n     just expecting the worst. When the City finally starts manifesting\n     because we start getting closer and closer, I'm like, this is a monster\n     of a city.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : This is a huge city. The lights were just super bright\n     because I hadn't slept the whole night because I was just so nervous. I\n     was just peeking out, peeking out. I was super anxious. Here I am\n     landing in this monstrosity of a city, and I looked down, I'm like, man\n     this is just, I'm not ready for this. I don't want to land. I don't\n     want to be here. But then I'm like, \"You know what? you earned this,\n     you earned this trip, take it.\" We finally land. It was around four,\n     almost four, and I was lost. I was lost. I was depressed, I was lost. I\n     was mad at myself, and I didn't want to accept it. I want to just go\n     back and not be here. It was a scary looking city. It was overwhelming.\n   \n   \n     Claudia: How long ago was that again?\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Eight years and a few, eight let's say, what's today's\n     date? It's nine right?

I am very relentless and I chase my\n     goals with almost a reckless pursuit. There is a book that I shaped my\n     life around called Frankenstein. Nothing to do with the movie at all.\n     There's even an essay that I actually read a lot called\u2026 there is an\n     essay by some guy in some university I don't even know, but the point\n     being is what was Frankenstein? The reckless pursuit of knowledge.\n     Because what the scientists did was he chopped down his moral and\n     ethical limits to obtain a goal because at the end of the day, morally\n     and ethically speaking, that's wrong, but he achieved something that\n     was thought impossible. He played God, and he obtained it.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : You know what the problem was? He created something ugly\n     in the eyes of society because Frankenstein was ugly looking. He had a\n     beautiful heart at first, but due to society's rejection, Frankenstein\n     turned evil because he was rejected, and all he wanted was just to fit\n     in. Frankenstein ended up just blowing up. I am Frankenstein in this\n     sense. I have been shaped and molded by the States and Mexico. I may be\n     ugly on the outside, but my intentions are sincere and pure on the\n     inside. If society doesn't want to accept him for who I am, let them\n     be. At the end of the day, I don't need anybody's approval.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : So yes, I am the scientist, and I am the Frankenstein\n     both. I'm not saying that I'm going to chop down my ethical and moral\n     limits because I do have limits, but I'm going to do whatever it takes\n     to get to where I'm at, and I ain't going to also become that product,\n     but the difference is here is that, one I'm not going to disregard my\n     moral and ethical views and two, I'm not going to go berserk on society\n     and because I'm not welcome. I don't need to be welcomed. I just need\n     to be respected. That's it.\n   \n   \n     Claudia: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American?\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Neither. I consider myself an infinite being that has no\n     nationality nor borders. I consider myself a being of light. I consider\n     myself and the universe manifesting itself in three dimensions, a part\n     of it. That's what I consider myself. I'm beyond the whole\n     \u201cMexican-American\u201d.

It's the name of a Mexica emperor and I like to\n     say Mexica instead of Aztec because that's a proper name. Most people\n     think Aztec is a proper name, but it's actually Mexica.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : It's the name of the last Mexica emperor that valiantly\n     and ruthlessly fought against Cortes without any iron, without any\n     guns, without any cannons.

What has been going\n     on, all that.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Ever since I started studying about, because I'm a\n     chemical engineer at heart. Let me show you a few things. Ever since I\n     started looking at these videos - go ahead actually browse through it.\n     Ever since I started aligning myself with certain frequencies and\n     listening to actual music and positive affirmations and self-\n     programming, I've seen a significant change in the way - there's\n     actually this thing called god frequency, and the monks actually\n     meditate under there's an ohm that they chant, and that ohm is meant to\n     be voiced in a particular frequency.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Whenever you align yourself, your voice, your mind, you\n     align yourself to a celestial frequency, great things start to happen\n     because whenever you're tuning into a negative and bad frequency, a lot\n     of things like that just start to surround your life. But when you\n     change the frequency, and you align yourself with positive mentality\n     with positive affirmations, positive people, positive music, positive\n     frequencies, and just being in tune with the god frequency, being in\n     tune with life frequency because there's more than one. There's the God\n     frequency, there's life frequency, there's just a bunch of really nice\n     frequencies there. There's healing frequencies that people that\n     practice Reiki. They also tune into those frequencies.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : Those frequencies have really just helped me get my life\n     together. They have really helped me heal. I would say that I'm still\n     broken because I haven't mastered myself fully yet, but at least I'm\n     healed. I'm broken but just with like, maybe like a stitch. It's there.\n     It's a huge open wound still because the pain is still there but it\n     doesn't hurt anymore like it used to. It's just the pain that maybe\n     when you sprain an ankle and eventually you walk it off. Like you step\n     on it, and it's just pulses but it's not to the point where you can't\n     walk, you can walk, you can do stuff and it's just that tiny pulse it\n     just shoots up and you even sometimes even step real hard so it goes\n     away.

I feel that you have continuously said that, but if you\n   want to specifically answer that too you can?\n \n \n   Cuauht\u00e9moc: Of course, I'm extremely competitive in every way. In my work\n   environment, I'm highly respected because last month I did the work of\n   three people. We are measured by the amount of work you do. I'm a security\n   administrator and access management for Royal Caribbean and Adecco. I\n   basically create user accounts, manage their computer accesses, and the\n   programs they get to see. So on a monthly basis, I'm almost always first\n   place and usually it's by a long shot. So last month I did about a thousand\n   tasks myself, and it's a team of four. I did a thousand by myself and the\n   rest of the team did a thousand, so it was like 2000 total. But a thousand\n   just came from me, myself. And I'm in two campaigns, not just one, due to\n   the fact that I'm like the SAS or like the SEAL Team Ten. When the campaign\n   is broken, they send the best, and I'm one of that elite, I guess the elite\n   team.\n \n \n   Cuauht\u00e9moc: I'm doing two campaigns right now. I think the graveyard people\n   do multiple campaigns, but it's just calls, they take calls. I don't take\n   calls, I do more delicate stuff. I delegate accesses, I assign certain\n   programs and stuff. So my competitiveness has been ... I've always been\n   very hungry in that sense. Since my first job here, I was doing overtime in\n   training because I had that spark. I'm a fast learner and, no, it's not a\n   brag, it's just me being sincere. I'm very fast. I've been gifted with that\n   fast learning capability. So I adapt quickly to my environment. [Snaps]. So\n   how has the US shaped me? Dominant. I seek dominance. Not in a way that it\n   steps on people, but I share my skills in an attempt for you to come back\n   also.\n \n \n   Cuauht\u00e9moc: Because in order for a society to grow it needs to be\n   collective. I come up, you come up with me. I try to pull you. If you don't\n   want to be pulled, that's fine, I'll leave you alone as long as you don't\n   bring us down. And that's basically the way I consider everything. Let's\n   grow, I'm not going to grow alone. You come with me, if you don't want to\n   grow, at least be neutral and don't hinder us. Don't hurt us."

His death occurred on April 2nd, 1992. I was born on\n   April 24th, 1990\u2014we were actually just preparing for my second birthday.\n   The murder occurred in the streets of Nezahualc\u00f3yotl. My father was a\n   judicial. He was doing his job, he was arresting people left and right,\n   doing his job quite well actually. He was excelling. He was a very good\n   agent and it appears as though he was targeting drug-related criminals. So,\n   he was murdered at gunpoint with a machine gun. I guess he was shot like\n   eighty times. That led to the impulse of my mom wanting to leave. One,\n   because my uncles from that side of the family didn't want my mom to claim\n   anything since we had a restaurant, we had like two, three homes, my dad\n   had a few cars amongst other things, he had weapons machine guns and stuff\n   like that.\n \n \n   Cuauht\u00e9moc: So, they didn't take my father's death lightly. They actually\n   wanted to take me away from her and I guess because they felt that she\n   wasn't apt to raise me since my father was basically the one paying for\n   everything. My mom was taking care of business too, but she was mainly just\n   there to take care of us. She didn't really work at that time, so they're\n   like, \"Hey, give him to us we'll raise him.\" Part of my family at the time\n   was religious so they're like, we will give him a better home. So my mom\n   decided, hey, this is not happening, that's my son and we're leaving. So I\n   was in second grade when this happened, of elementary school. We took off,\n   I got a tourist visa and we left. My mom actually left before me. Why? The\n   explanation I got from her was so that she can check out the situation\n   first and not put me in any sort of danger. So basically I stayed with my\n   aunt an extra year. She took off and by the time she felt stable, she\n   called for me. So, that's pretty much what happened.\n"

You guys feel you're the shit. You guys feel\n     you're superior. You guys feel you're all that because you've been in\n     the States. And I did. I actually did. It's not a lie. In my case, when\n     I came back, I'm like, man, my ego was way up there, although I was\n     depressed I used to feel I was the shit because one, where do I come\n     from? I used to have a lot of money. I used to have people under my\n     control. At one point I had 200 people under my power and control. I\n     actually came feeling pretty freaking hard, you know, I felt hard.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : I felt powerful because I had people under my power, and\n     you get over here and you know what? People will try to talk down on\n     me. I'm like, \u201cYou know where I come from? You know what I've been\n     through? You know who you're talking to?\u201d That's the vibe I gave off.\n     People used to tell me, you know what, when you got here, you used to\n     feel you were this big shit, you used to feel you were running the show\n     when in reality you had nothing. You were nobody. And that's true. I\n     was nobody and I had nothing. I thought about, I'm like, you're right.\n     I'm nothing and I have nobody, where are my houses? Where's the money?\n     Where's everything. Back home and they're my mother's things not mine.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : I had a car but I crashed it. That made me think and I'm\n     like, these guys are actually right. We do come back thinking we're all\n     that. Most of us do because I know most of us were in gangs. Most of us\n     had something going on. We had a lot of money, we had cars so when you\n     come over here, and I actually had this problem once where you got\n     people from Polanco and nice parts thinking they're the shit and\n     they're like, wait a minute, you just barely have this tiny thing and\n     you feel you're all that and I had way more than you, so then you start\n     realizing I used to be like that. I used to feel I was this big\n     powerful person. But in reality I was nobody. That helped me have some\n     retro analysis and retrospective retro analysis. I'm like, do you know\n     what, these guys are right.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : I came with a super big ego over here thinking, I'm all\n     cool I'm this super cool guy this and that so I just humbled down a\n     lot. It helped me humble down and I'm like, I've got to be more careful\n     about that because that's why people be hating on pochos because we\n     think we're the shit. Maybe not all of us, but I know a good majority.\n     If we were in gangs, we clash a lot with people like, \"What the hell\n     are you looking at? What you looking at man?\" That's the typical\n     response you get from a pocho because we're also taught in prison to be\n     very aggressive. We come from prison, we don't come from Disneyland, we\n     were in the system.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : We were very aggressive. We like to eat people just with\n     the stare. So if you see people dogging you, you're going to dog \u2018em\n     back and you're like, \"What the hell are you looking at?\" It's a\n     defensive mechanism that we have. We're not in prison anymore, but we\n     feel we've got to still be protective of ourselves because we're\n     exposed. We're very much exposed because we speak English. People be\n     kidnapping us because they think that we have a lot of money, so we\n     have that vibe towards those to that we got to protect ourselves. I let\n     that go and I'm very friendly now. I smile at people. I speak English\n     in the streets too, but I do it more like, you know, and if people look\n     at me, I just smile at them and let them know that I'm not here to hurt\n     anybody, that I'm not here to fight anybody.\n   \n   \n     Cuauht\u00e9moc : So my vibe that I throw out is different now. But it took\n     me years to learn to calm down because when I first got here, I was on\n     the defensive 24/7 because I just came out of jail. It's not easy just\n     reincorporating into a society that right off the bat doesn't like you.\n "

Punish me however you\n     want to punish me. I don't care. I deserved it. It's fine. I was\n     intoxicating your people. I was breaking the law. Let's be fair about\n     it. You want to kick me out? Kick me the hell out. I don't mind. I'll\n     live with it. I'll swallow my pride. I'll live with the depression for\n     as long as I need to live with it because at the end of the day I was\n     doing something wrong and it deserves punishment because it's not like\n     you're doing something beneficial.

We're trying to understand this, what is so\n   exciting about gangs?\n \n \n   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,\n   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school\n   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good\n   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over\n   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching\n   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with\n   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of\n   alone time.\n \n \n   Anita: Was it fun hanging out with gangs?\n \n \n   Diana: Yes, at the beginning. Well, yes it was. At that age it was. Now\n   that I am old and different but --\n \n \n   Anita: But what was fun about it?\n \n \n   Diana: It was fun because I felt that I could be more me. Also, that\n   depends because of the whole situation with my family. In my family, my dad\n   was an alcoholic and stuff like that. so we were more quiet and stuff like\n   that. And my brothers and sisters, they had their own problems too. I'm the\n   youngest, that's why it was me the only one that went over there with my\n   mom.\n \n \n   Anita: So you had to leave your sisters and brothers behind?\n \n \n   Diana: Yeah, since they were already married and stuff. They stayed here.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you mad at your parents for taking you or your mom for taking\n   you to the US?\n \n \n   Diana: The very first month, yes because I mean, I knew the situation\n   between her and my dad, but at that time, I mean I did love my dad anyways.\n   So then it was hard for me, not seeing him and stuff like that.\n \n \n   Anita: Yeah, I can imagine. So when you say I could be more me when I was\n   with the gang, what do you mean?\n \n \n   Diana: It's because also, I always grew up with a little bit of conflict\n   with my mom because she had a lot of rules that even from when I was young,\n   I didn't agree with them. [chuckles] I mean also I know now that she had\n   those kind of thinkings and stuff because of the way she grew up and all\n   the problems she had so ... but at that moment, you don't think about any\n   of that, is just mainly you so [chuckles].\n \n \n   Anita: So being me, what do you mean when you say I could be more me?\n \n \n   Diana: Because I could be how I wanted, like they wouldn't judge me. And\n   also, before I felt I was like more weak, I was so scared of a lot of\n   things and everything, and that also kind of helped me be\u2013 because also\n   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,\n   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff\n   like that, that starts stopping. I learned to make them stop to bully me.\n   So then I started liking the fact that I could let, you know be bullied.\n"

You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows\n   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.\n   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The\n   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped\n   us and they had guns and they took everything.

You sleep wherever you want to. It's just, and then they wake\n   you up, you almost never sleep. I remember that I was 72 hours awake and it\n   was just crazy. It was just hectic. But once get into the immigration\n   center, it's pretty chill.\n \n \n   Anita: Why wouldn't they let you sleep?\n \n \n   Donovan: Because they just moving you around, just moving you from spot to\n   spot to spot on the bus.\n \n \n   Donovan: I don't know. I feel like I'm not meant to be on a plane. I have\n   to study aeronautic physics or something to understand how the plane works\n   because I get really sick on planes. [Laughs]. I threw up the whole time\n   and it doesn't fit in my mind how that piece of metal can be in the air.\n   It's impossible. It's not meant to be. And in the plane that they take you\n   over there, you can hear everything squeaking, you can feel, you can see\n   everything moving. And your handcuffs\u2014your handcuffed from your wrist to\n   your waist and then there's another chain to your feet. Then you start\n   thinking every single stupid thought you can. What if the plane falls in\n   the water? How am I going to swim? Are you going to swim like a dolphin?\n   What am I going do chained up?\n \n \n   Donovan: And the immigration center, they give you good food. My mom used\n   to always put money for commissary. They told me that I had a chance to\n   stay there and fight to become a US citizen. A year into me being there, I\n   met a guy who had less crimes than I had, and he already said seven years\n   there. I was like, \u201cNo, it's not going to do. I'm going to waste 10 years\n   of my life. My mom's not going to see me, not even my friends from my\n   school will see me.\u201d The public defender I had, was like, \u201cNo,\u201d she didn't\n   want it. I was like, \u201cYou know what? I want to dip. I want to go. I don't\n   care.\u201d And she started telling me\u2014it was a Mexican girl\u2014things are fucked\n   up. I was like, \u201cI want to go. I can\u2019t give a fuck. I want to leave right\n   now.\u201d And she was still fighting for me. I remember that time I stood up\n   and I was like, \u201cYou know what, I no longer want her to represent me.\u201d And\n   the judge was like, \u201cNo, no. He doesn't know.\u201d I was like, \u201cI no longer\n   want her to represent me. I'm over age. I can represent myself.\u201d And the\n   judge, I still remember, was like, \u201cWhat do you want?\u201d I was like, \u201cI want\n   you to deport me tonight. I want to be in Mexico right now.\u201d It was a year\n   and eight months. I was going nuts. I don't know. I was 180 pounds. I was a\n   butterball, so I just wanted to leave. I found out about that guy's case\n   and I was like, \u201cYou know what? I'm not going to waste seven years of my\n   life here. I'd rather be somewhere over there.\u201d\n"

And then it was real eye opener when they\n   told me that I had an INS hold.\n \n \n   Anita: What kind of trouble did you get into?\n \n \n   Donovan: Well, when I was younger, I was really into gangs. I sold a lot of\n   drugs when I was younger. My mom kicked me out the house when I was 15,\n   because I couldn't have that around little brothers. I have a younger\n   brother from my stepdad and my mom. And I'm 11 years older than him. He's\n   21 right now, just a baby. At the moment I'm like, \u201cWhy would you kick me\n   out? I'm 15 years old.\u201d But then I see it and I see they couldn't be around\n   that. They would see that lifestyle. I was making a lot of money, so they\n   would see that lifestyle, and, of course, everybody as a human being wants\n   to go the easy way. They don't want to struggle. If my sister would've saw\n   that, God knows what she would have been like.

A lot of stuff to do with the culture. You mixing up and just\n   you feeling lost. You're over there and then you know that you don't have\n   papers, so you feel lost already. You're like, \u201cI don't belong here.\u201d Then\n   you come here and like, \u201cDamn, I don't belong here either.\u201d You was just\n   like a cast away, just like somebody weird.

Being in jail here. This jail here is something\n   gruesome, very scary. [Pause]. It's a two-dormitory bedroom, for only two\n   people, but since the jails here are so packed, it was 17 people for a two\n   roomy bedroom. It's crazy. There's no windows at all. There's no piece of\n   glass and no window. The clothes you get is the one that you have, and\n   unless your family brings you food, sometimes you don't get food over here.\n   There's a lot of deaths inside of there. The jails here are super unsafe.\n   After I was there and then I seen my little kids starting to grow up, I\n   feel like it was right about time. I felt like if I didn't do a drastic\n   change, either I was going to die or I couldn't be incarcerated for life.\n   So, I feel like you get tired of it.\n \n \n   Donovan: You get tired of waking up and not having nobody who cares about\n   you. You wake up and all you want to do is bad shit. I get tired of it. I\n   got tired of it.

But my mom\n   always tells me, my teacher tells me, all this stuff that you went through\n   makes you the person that you are right now. It's something that you have\n   to do.

I would probably say 80% now. But, yeah. When I\n   got here, it was very bad. Very, very bad.\n \n \n   Anne: Uh-huh (affirmative). But yeah, your buddy.

Caretaker.\n \n \n   Edgar: Caretaker. Yeah. Caretaker. Yeah, she does that.

I think you can live a good life here\n   in Mexico, too. And not worry about if you come back, you're not going to\n   have a job, none of that. I think that you shouldn't worry about that. I\n   think that, coming back here, you can make friends, too. You can have a new\n   life. Yeah. I don't know.\n"

I have driver's\n   license for another state. Then, he made it no valid which was a violation.\n   I know it was illegal, but I was trying to stick as much as I can to the\n   law.

I used to do that.\n \n \n   Anita: But you said you would think about going back to the States?\n \n \n   Erik: Not thinking going back, not really. It's not my priority. But if I\n   would\u2026 There is a slight possibility. I have a girlfriend, and she is\n   becoming a citizen. And she wants to marry and fix my documents. If that\n   happens, yes. But if not, then I would not.\n \n \n   Anita: So you've managed to keep your girlfriend in the states?\n \n \n   Erik: Not really, because I never did in the past because even though when\n   I try\u2014not try because I have the chances three times\u2014I never feel like I\n   just going to marry because I want my document. Now, somehow, I do regret,\n   like, \u201cMan. I should do that.\u201d But it was my decision.

I don't\n   drink. I don't drunk and drive. I quit drugs. Never been in the United\n   States been using drugs. I been doing social work. I used to go to church,\n   so they going to see that this is a good guy who does not deserve to be\n   deported. What was the reason, work is what he do. That was my hope.\n \n \n   Anita: [Affirmative noise].\n \n \n   Erik: On the Obama's presidency, the immigration laws, they have a\u2014I don't\n   know the terminology, but they considered morals. You have morals? You\n   don't have a criminal background? You don't have felonies? Which, I don't\n   have even a criminal record. It was only a driver\u2019s license offense. It was\n   like going to jail for steal Doritos. [Laughs]. You know? But that's it.\n   So, my dreams, it was like, \u201cWell, if you go to court, when you go to\n   court, supposed to be... Justice, no? And if you see a judge...\u201d [Laughs].\n   I could even see, on the judge face, \u201cI going to fuck you up, but I don\u2019t\n   have to.\u201d I could see that on the judge face when he give me the sentence.\n   I\u2019m sorry for cursing, but I could see that on his face.

So we need some immigration reform to fix the system.\n \n \n   Frank: A little.\n \n \n   Lizzie: I agree.

What were some of the bad experiences?\n \n \n   Frank: For example, that there was a lot of bullying on my school. Either\n   that it was not, we could say, a whole American school. It was like a mix\n   school where there were people from Asia, Thailand, Greece, Nigeria, and us\n   Latinos were from Guatemala and all this stuff. We were on this special\n   group and all my mates from the classroom they were saying that we were the\n   retarded group because we were on a English Learning Skills [program].\n \n \n   Lizzie: Wow. So some kids at school called you the retarded group?\n \n \n   Frank: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzie: The white kids?\n \n \n   Frank: I don't like the to say that word because it's getting into a little\n   bit of ethnic discrimination, but I will say yeah, the American kids, they\n   were saying that to all of us.\n \n \n   Lizzie: To those of you that were learning English?\n \n \n   Frank: Yeah, and that's why I make my will to go and less than two years to\n   gain or improve my English. I went from seventh grade I was on ELL 1 all\n   the way to Read 180. I remember there was a skill that they had six in one\n   year.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Oh wow. One year. I know that scale. That's very impressive.\n \n \n   Frank: Actually, when I gave my \u00e2\u0080\u00a6 They were telling me that I just needed\n   to improve a little bit more of my fluency so I can get into more normal\n   classes and also doing all those comments. They were making me a little\n   more impotent because I wanted to have science classes, math classes as\n   normal, and was not getting in matched to it. Also, because of that I\n   talked to my counselor, they put me on construction, science and civics, so\n   I get into a little more in touch, and I can say that was one of my baddest\n   experience. Also, when I was working on delivering the paper, there was\n   customers that were so patriotic that they were even leaving notes\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 how do\n   you say\u00e2\u0080\u00a6 saying that there was not delivered their paper.\n \n \n   Lizzie: Like a complaint?\n \n \n   Frank: A complaint, that's correct answer. They were leaving their\n   complaints saying that they don't want a Mexican to deliver their papers\n   and there were homes where we will, as Mexican, we always like to give our\n   best, so there was these parts where we had to walk the whole hallway to\n   leave the paper between the doors and they still leave complaints being\n   racist. Also, our supervisor were like, I'm not going to take it aware of\n   this complaint so I'm going to pay to you, but they are going to still be\n   affecting you."

When I was in fifth grade, I always saw these kids that have\n   their patrol flex and I told my counselor that I wanted to be a patrol.\n   They told me that I can join this patrol and they put me on proof. I was\n   doing really well. I had these trips to the Mall of America and one of the\n   scenarios, I remember Ms. _______, it was on my _____ School and she\n   offered me if I wanted to go make an essay because there was a how can you\n   say \u00e2\u0080\u0093 there was a program where they said that we can get in contact to go\n   and visit the White House because I wanted to learn a little bit more about\n   the culture.\n \n \n   Frank: So, I make my essay in Spanish. She helped me for around three\n   months to get all of the essay translated to English. She also was helping\n   me making my essay. I remember that it was around 800 words. We had to\n   write out, so I make my effort. She helped me send all the forms and two or\n   three weeks after, I received a letter. It was coming also with the stamp\n   the color gold and because on those times I was not really getting into the\n   English.\n \n \n   Frank: I brought it to her and to see if she can translate it for me and\n   she was telling me, actually she didn't want it to hurt my feelings, so she\n   started telling me in other words that I didn't qualify because there was\n   things missing on the essay, but now that I can understand it, I can see\n   that because of my immigration status I was not able to qualify for the\n   visit to the White House. So I still have the envelope, as a memory, and I\n   have all those papers.

            "interview_part": "\n   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,\n   they're like, \"So you guys won\u2019t come alone, meet up with that family, so\n   you can all come over.\" And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a\n   son\u2014he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,\n   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.\n \n \n   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And\n   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to\n   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my\n   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I\n   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.\n \n \n   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he\n   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say\n   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these\n   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.\n   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,\n   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.\n \n \n   Ilse: And so, I was left behind with my mom, and the woman with her son,\n   and we tried to cross the border through the desert. But it was awful. Even\n   being at the border, waiting for the instructions to go ahead and start the\n   journey, you know? And seeing so many people, and kids, and women... It was\n   just so bad, you know? And those images are so vivid in my head still. Then\n   after that, we were lost in the desert for three days. We ran out of water,\n   we ran out of food, we ran out of everything; the coyote got lost. And\n   there was a point... when it rains in the desert, it's so bad. Like, the\n   thunderstorms are so, so bad. I'll never forget how this woman that was\n   traveling with us, she was like hallucinating, I guess. It was so bad that\n   it was raining and that there was a thunderstorm, and she thought that this\n   one cactus was a person.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, she almost fell, so she thought she was going to grab onto\n   someone, and she grabbed onto the cactus, and all her body was left with\n   the little pikes. It was so bad, and then being lost\u2026\n \n \n   Ilse: We knew that they were going to be looking for us, obviously, or\n   someone out there, so we just decided to wait. We waited it out. But before\n   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was\n   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's\n   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,\n   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.\n   So, my mom and I got lost, right?\n \n \n   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just\n   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was\n   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,\n   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so\n   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on\n   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,\n   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,\n   \"Okay, we're going to wait it out.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything\n   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that\n   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I\n   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they\n   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this\u2014they\n   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal\n   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some\n   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and\n   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't\n   remember anything about that.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, \"Okay, I found out a way.\n   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking.\" And that was the third day.\n   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and\n   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.\n   So close. And yet so far, literally.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, my mom just hugged me and she's like, \"The first thing you're\n   going to do is you're going to run to the water.\" And, yeah. So, they\n   caught us, and they said that we're violating US laws. They were so rude,\n   so rude, I swear. And then they were like\u2014I mean, I know I was a little\n   girl, but I could understand what they were telling my mom, you know?\u2014and\n   they were just like, angry at her, too, because, \"How could you ever even\n   think that your daughter... and she's so young...\" Apparently, I looked\n   really sick. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Ilse: And so, they just got us on the vans, and we went to the border\n   prison. I was in prison for some time. Well, a day. [Chuckles]. And then,\n   they took us back to the border and we had to start all over again. And it\n   was just so sad and depressing, because the way we tried and everything we\n   went through. That's why I was so angry when I got over there, because no\n   human being should have to go through so much just so they could change\n   their economic status, or just so they could run away from problems that\n   you can't control.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, then we found out my brother was over there already. He was in\n   Texas, I think; I don't even know. And my mom was like, \"We have to do it\n   again. We have to try because your brother's over there, because your dad's\n   already waiting for us.\" So, we didn't have any money, we didn't have\n   anything, but the woman that we were with, she still had some money. So, we\n   went over to a motel\u2014and this is where I'm always grateful, and God is\n   like... or I have this huge angel or something.\n \n \n   Ilse: The owners of the motel kind of heard the story when my mom was\n   talking to my dad on the phone, and they said that they knew these people\n   that faked the visas, or passports, and we could do it with them. And so,\n   my mom talked to my dad and everything, and so, we were in training for two\n   days, learning somebody else's identity. Name, everything, you have to know\n   everything about the person, or at least the basics. It had to be in\n   English, and I didn't know any English, or my mom didn't know any\n   English\u2014she's so bad at that. [Chuckles]. So we kept practicing and\n   practicing, and I finally got it, right? So, I was good to go. And then my\n   mom, she had a really, really hard time. Really hard time.\n \n \n   Ilse: The day came when we had to actually do it. A slight happy moment\n   that I had was when they brought me clothes, because you have to look good,\n   you have to look like you were normal, I guess. So, I got new clothes, and\n   I was so happy because it had been three horrible weeks before that, and\n   then just getting that was really nice. And the people were so nice to me,\n   so nice.\n \n \n   Ilse: So, we get to the border on a van, and they're like, \"Okay, so,\n   everyone's going to separate, everyone is going to go their own way, and\n   we'll see you guys when we cross.\" So, we were on our own. And I remember\n   asking my mom, \"Mom, just tell me a little bit, what's your story?\" And she\n   just blacked out. She didn't know anything. Like, she just went blank, her\n   mind went blank. I was like, \"Oh, my God, no. This is going to be so bad.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: So, this is again where God is amazing, or whatever, because when it\n   was going to be our turn where you give the papers and they ask you these\n   questions, the guy in front of us was caught. So, a bunch of officers went\n   over to him, and started asking him all these questions, so I just grabbed\n   my mom's hand and I'm like, \"Mom, let's just go.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: We walked, and they didn't ask any questions, nothing. We just\n   walked, and we were in the US. And that was a relief because I didn't want\n   to go through the other thing all over again. [Chuckle]. To this day, I\n   swear I don't know how that happened. And I'm just so grateful because, I\n   mean, we were able to do it that easy, you know?\n \n \n   Ilse: My mom's always telling me this. When you do good things in life, and\n   you're a good person, good things happen to you. And ever since then, I've\n   been so grateful for that opportunity that I just try to be good to people\n   and I just try to do good things, you know? So, I guess that can come back\n   to me? And yeah, but that's how we got to the US, and then we got on a\n   van...\n \n \n   Ilse: Well, then we met up with my brother. That was the best moment, when\n   I saw my brother, because he's always been everything to me, always, and\n   just being able to see him and hug him and everything, that was the best\n   moment. And then, we got on the van, and it took us around three days, two\n   days, I honestly don't remember, to get to North Carolina. And, yeah. Then\n   united with my dad, and that's it. That's the story of how we got there.\n"

            "interview_part": "I found a really good college who\n   allowed me, they allowed me to work full-time and go to college full-time.\n   So, I majored in international business and commerce, my dream career, and\n   I went to college for four years while working.\n \n \n   Ilse: When I was in Telvista, I started as a CSR, just answering calls, and\n   became mentor, and then I was a supervisor at 19, which was really hard\n   experience\u2014it was so tough\u2014but at the same time, it helped me so much and\n   it gave me the basics to work and be able to do what I do now. Then I\n   worked for the Western Union Corporate, the one that they have here in\n   Mexico. I was in Telvista for two years and a half, then Western Union for\n   a year and a half, and then I was sick and tired of call centers, I didn't\n   want to do that anymore.\n \n \n   Ilse: And, I'm so persistent, and my tenacity is always up here, you know?\n   And I was like, \"Nope, I'm done with this. I need to do something that\n   involves my career.\" So, when I was in sixth semester, I tried to look for\n   a job regarding my major, and I was able to find a job. But it was more\n   like an intern job, so I was so blessed because I had savings, you know, so\n   I was able to take it. But they paid so little! [Laughs]. It was awful!\n \n \n   Ilse: But I'm so grateful for that opportunity, because that company that\n   hired me, it was a fusion. They were two companies, a company that was\n   based in China, in Shanghai, for inspection services, and an international\n   logistics company that took care of [inaudible 00:26:06] and the customs\n   clearance and everything. When I first got there, I went to the logistics\n   one, which involved me selling international transportation. I had no idea;\n   I had no training. I tried so hard but honestly, I did a really bad job.\n   [Laughs].\n \n \n   Ilse: But the other company's director, he saw how pushy I was, how\n   dedicated I was\u2014I mean, I'm talking about, the normal hours to come into\n   work were at nine, and I signed my contract to go from nine to four, but I\n   would always get there at eight. I would organize my calls, and at nine, I\n   was calling, prospecting, and everything. And he saw my dedication, and\n   three months after my hiring, he offered me a position at the inspections\n   company. And that was just life-changing because after that, he obviously\n   raised my salary.\n \n \n   Ilse: He is an amazing boss. He's still my boss until today. After a year\n   and a half, been with both, the fusion of the company, he decides to\n   separate. So, we went from being the company department to being a company.\n   So, I've been able to help him out with the whole... from logo, from\n   everything. Everything regarding the company. And I'm just so grateful, I'm\n   so happy there, you have no idea. I've been able to travel to China twice\n   already. I travel in Mexico City so much. I've met so many people, the\n   China chamber, the Mexico City chamber, so many important organizations, so\n   many important people, so many important... Forever 21, for instance. We're\n   trying to do services for them.\n \n \n   Ilse: And it was just so amazing. Everything happens for a reason. I know\n   that maybe I wasn't supposed to stay over there. Maybe it was just a little\n   help, to try and be to where I am today. But still, I know there's\n   opportunities in Mexico. I barely learned about New Comienzos a month ago.\n   And I just want to tell people and help them understand that we don't have\n   to be over there. We can do so many things here. And we can prove that\n   they're missing out! [Laughs]. Because I could have done all this for a\n   company that is based over there, but obviously, well, that was impossible,\n   so I'm here.\n"

I want to have a degree, and\n   I want to be able to help people. I want to represent Mexico because just\u2014I\n   love the States because of everything that it gave me, but the way that it\n   happened, it was so hard on me, and I always wanted to prove that Mexicans\n   can do good, and good things, you know?\n \n \n   Ilse: And so, going to high school, I tried really hard, I had really good\n   grades, I graduated third in my class. I was so into volunteering, I was in\n   the student council, I did sports, I did everything. I wanted to be perfect\n   so I could get scholarships. But it got to a point that I finally\n   understood that it was never going to happen because it's so expensive. I\n   couldn't go to a community college, I couldn't go\u2014which was never my idea.\n   I couldn't go to a four-year college because it was so expensive, and the\n   scholarships are limited for people like me who were undocumented. When I\n   finally got that, it just broke my heart because I was like, \"I've tried so\n   hard. I've given it everything, and I'm still not going to be able to stay\n   here.\" So, one day, I talked to my dad and I said, \"Dad, I really, really\n   want to go to college.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: And he's like, \"But I can't do it. I can't pay for it. It's too\n   expensive.\" And he's like, \"You either stay here and work, and try to go\n   whenever you save up, or you go back to Mexico.\"\n \n \n   Ilse: And I thought about it. I was like, \"Well, Mexico's my country, my\n   dad's telling me to pretty much leave and he's not going to support me, so\n   might as well just leave.\" So, right after college [means, high school] I\n   graduated June 11th in 2011, and I was back to Mexico July second in 2011.\n   And I just decided to leave, to start over.\n \n \n   Claudia: So, you pretty much just came by yourself? You made that decision?\n \n \n   Ilse: I did. I was 18, and I said to myself, \"If you have this one dream,\n   you're not going to be limited as to where you are. If you want to be\n   someone, you're going to be someone anywhere in the world.\" So, I just\n   said, \"Okay, I'm going to leave.\" And I left my parents and my brother, and\n   I've been here in Mexico for almost eight years now.\n \n \n   Claudia: For almost 10 years?\n \n \n   Ilse: Eight years.\n \n \n   Claudia: Eight years?

            "interview_part": "\n   Claudia: I just have a few more questions that are more just of a\n   reflection. The first, I guess in talking about returning, and the lack of\n   government assistance, what do you think that the Mexican government can do\n   to help returning migrants reintegrate into Mexican society?\n \n \n   Ilse: First of all, from the experience of being at the border\u2026Because they\n   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to\n   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,\n   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can\n   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part\n   of the border. Help people in the border.\n \n \n   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican\n   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, \"Oh, you're about to do something\n   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you\n   from doing it.\" Why not change that speech? Why not say, \"Don't leave. How\n   can we help you so you won't leave?\" I mean, we could fix a problem from\n   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze\n   the people, make a profile\u2014there's a lot of people that are being deported\n   that have so much knowledge.\n \n \n   Ilse: I just met this one guy who worked in interior design and\n   construction all his life, and he has so much knowledge that he could help\n   people out. We have kind of buildings all over the place, and there's\n   always been something done in construction-wise. We help them out, you\n   know? Lend them a hand, give them the tools to have their own company, to\n   have what they had over there, and not make them feel restrained, or not\n   make them feel that they're not part of the country when we're in the same\n   boat.\n \n \n   Ilse: I think we have to work on that. We have to work on having work\n   opportunities not only in call centers. There's a lot of people who are too\n   good to be in a call center, but that's all they can find because maybe\n   they don't have a college degree, but they have experience. And I can tell\n   you, and it still happens to me, when people... When I'm working, I do have\n   to speak English sometimes, but when I'm in meetings with clients and\n   things like that, it's just Spanish. And when they hear that I speak\n   English or they talk about the States or something and I say that was there\n   and things like that, and they ask me why I'm here, and just telling them,\n   \"Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to.\" And then, them looking at me\n   weird, like, \"Why would you come back if you were over there?\" Or when they\n   ask, \"Did you have to come back because you were illegal?\" Dude, well,\n   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to\n   treat me differently.\n \n \n   Ilse: And the type of people that I meet are people who have visas, who go\n   back and forth, and they don't understand; \"Well, why don't you get a visa?\n   Why did you leave without a visa?\" \u201cNo...\u201d And I think changing that\n   mindset, too, from the people that are here\u2014 the people that were born here\n   and everything\u2014there must be a way to make them understand that we're still\n   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You\n   know?\n"

And it's not just\n   physically, it is intellectual. Your mind just keeps growing and keeps\n   growing, keeps growing, keeps growing nonstop. And I think welcoming people\n   from another ethnic groups is part of evolution. It's going to happen one\n   day.

It was scary especially when you get to the\n   checkpoint. You know they tell us, whenever you hear the truck stopping,\n   don't even breathe. Yeah. So it was scary, but I got the chance to cross.\n   The first time I crossed, I crossed with my uncle. My cousins they're like\n   my age and my brothers. So we crossed pretending we were his kids.

So there should be like a place\n   where people could live that you could actually still be with your family.\n   Like a tolerated area, kind of like either in Mexico or the US, because\n   breaking up families sucks. My kids, I'm telling you, my kids have daddy\n   issues real bad. Probably my son will end up in prison one day.

Right? So they're not ready for it.\n   And even if they start talking about it today, it will still be years\n   before anything happens, and families are still rotting away. People are\n   still suffering. Kids are still asking for daddy. There's somebody right\n   now at this moment right now, I guarantee you ma'am, crying because their\n   mom or their dad or both of them aren't there anymore. Because there are\n   cases like that. So, I guarantee you right now there's somebody shedding a\n   tear. There's somebody, and it's not just the people left in the United\n   States, it's the people trying to get back, they're like \u201cWhat do I do? I\n   risk it?

We've got people going out\n   there on TV talking all this, but I don't see nobody going back to the\n   neighborhood. I don't see righteous guys standing up, saying \u201cYou know what\n   I lived this experience, I'm going to become a counselor.\u201d You do see a\n   couple of guys that are outstanding stories, we're talking about Mr.\n   Escalante, I got a chance to meet the man. Really, really great. Mr.\n   Mulligan introduced me to him. These are great people, they're Hispanic\n   people. They're great leaders. They took a lot of people out of the\n   streets. But we need more of them. Since we don't have them standing up on\n   their own, we need to develop a program to make them stand up, to show them\n   how to stand up, to make leaders. Not for a leader to be born on their own\n   because that's a difficult situation\u2014we've got everything to lose. We\n   should develop a program where we actually like start proactively\n   installing a network of Hispanic leaders that will help us out.\n \n \n   JC: Like here is our processing center, we're going to send you to Chicago,\n   we're sending you to LA, we've got the same doctrine, we're going to help\n   these people, and we're going to get them off the streets. We're going to\n   show them that being a young Mexican in the United States is something to\n   be proud of. It's not something to be ashamed of. You're not to be\n   typified. That's the things that we need, because one guy can't do it\n   alone. One guy can't do it. Cesar Chavez can't do it, Escalante couldn't do\n   it, and all the people from back on the sleepy lagoon days, the people that\n   got shot at the Horseshoe Bar from [Unclear 00:50:23] and all that. These\n   are things that have happened in our culture, a lot of times. Sometimes I\n   wish we were black, these people they've come from a bad situation and have\n   learned that they've got rights. And us as Hispanics we still haven't\n   learned that.\n \n \n   JC: We haven't learned to value ourselves. We haven't learned to accept,\n   let people in general know the value that we have to them as a country and\n   as individually. We add to the culture of the United States. We work the\n   jobs that nobody wants to work, all the jobs that are paid too little for\n   people to even want to work them. That's the things that we need. Those are\n   the programs that we need to send money into. Privately if need be. I would\n   give whatever I make here, I would give money if they would say \u201cHey we're\n   starting a center where we're going to develop Hispanic leaders to get\n   people out of gangs and off the streets and off drugs.\u201d I would give to\n   that. I've lived through it, I know what it's like and I know it's\n   eventually not going to end up right so I would want to avoid that for\n   another human being, right? I think that's what we need.\n"

[Araya 00:10:27] Elizabeth, she's\n   twenty-six. I've got Julia Angelica and Julian Angel, they\u2019re brother and\n   sister, two different mothers. Julian is nineteen, Julia is seventeen, and\n   that's it. They're over there, I keep in touch with them, they're doing\n   very well. This is to express what's going on, you know inside, so I'm not\n   going to beat around the bush. You could tell that these kids have got real\n   bad daddy issues. So even now that I'm not even there, I see how everything\n   that has happened is not only affecting me, but even generations after me\n   are being affected by this whole situation. They know that I'm good, they\n   know that I'm not a gang banger anymore, they know that I work, they know\n   that I'm good. They know that I'm a regular person, but they still don't\n   have me. They're old now, they're probably not going to need me, but there\n   are some issues that they're going to deal with the rest of their lives,\n   and that's not a good thing for anybody. I wouldn't wish that on anybody.\n \n \n   Claudia: How would that be different if you had stayed in the United\n   States?\n \n \n   JC: I think the simple fact of knowing that you've got a father figure in\n   your life makes a big difference. I know this for a fact, and the U.S.\n   knows this for a fact. The government knows this for a fact, and the prison\n   industry knows this for a fact, because we all know. I've been to prison, I\n   know it's a business. And I know who runs all the PIA industry, the prison\n   industry authority, I know who's running all the USBs as well. It\u2019s all\n   government people behind all them names and they're working for themselves,\n   so they get these tickets and they have people working for them for\n   basically nothing. It's slave labor. And they're also getting paid for\n   having you be a slave at the same time. It's business all the way around.\n   And they know that if a father figure is not home, having them in prison\n   for some stuff that maybe they could find an option for. I'm not saying\n   that people do bad things they deserve good things, no. But I'm saying that\n   there might be options.\n \n \n   JC: You can't just keep sticking people in prison all the time, you can't\n   keep throwing them away. The problem is still there, you can't hide it\n   anymore. It's happening. People are going out, and people are shooting\n   people. The laws are getting stricter and people out there, they think if\n   I'm going to go to prison for the rest of my life I might as well hold\n   court right here in this place. And the government knows that if a father\n   figure is not home their kids are more than likely going to end up being a\n   low paid slave laborer in prison as well. Those are numbers, and that's\n   something that can't be denied, you know? I was stupid and I fell into that\n   number game. I regret that, but somebody needs to hear that, they need to\n   know what's really going on.\n \n \n   JC: It's not about somebody did a crime, it's about how they\u2019re setting us\n   up. How could I stick my foot out then you fall and say you fell on your\n   own? No, you didn't do that. You didn't do that brother. Or let me help you\n   up. Nobody's saying that anymore, nobody reaches out their hand to help you\n   up. And the way things are nowadays with media and everything that's\n   accessible, people are just getting more desensitized everyday. Everyday\n   people care less and less.

But then\n   you'll see that the teachers are just as ignorant because they're like, \u201cAy\n   Jeimmy, lee la p\u00e1gina tal\" [Ay Jeimmy, read this page] I can't read. I\n   don't know. I can barely speak Spanish. You want me to read it?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So I would be like, \"el carro\u201d [the car] and everybody would start\n   laughing because I can't roll my R's. It's like, a ver di carro, di carro,\n   di ferrocarril,\" [let\u2019s see, say car, say car, say train] (In American\n   accent) and I can't roll my R's. So, they'll make fun of my accent. And\n   yeah, the teacher was horrible, and the students were also. In the four\n   months that I was just in middle school, I saw how a teacher grabbed his\n   seatbelt and whooped the student [Chuckles]. So, I was like, \"Oh my God,\n   this would not happen in the States.\" So it's really, really different.\n \n \n   Tim: So, you mentioned right there that there's like the teachers act very\n   differently.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yes.\n \n \n   Tim: Can you explain that a little bit more? Do they teach differently too,\n   or?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I would say they don't even teach you it. They just go to waste\n   their time on you and get paid off of it. Because in the three months that\n   I was there, I honestly don't remember learning anything. Like nothing. It\n   was just like going and wasting my time because I was going for like two\n   weeks and then this teacher, she -- se fractur\u00f3 la mano and so le dieron\n   incapacidad. [she broke her arm and was put on disability]\n \n \n   Jeimmy: And they were trying to look for a substitute teacher. So while\n   they were looking for a substitute teacher, we were like three weeks\n   without a teacher. So you could imagine kids just coming in and out of the\n   classroom, throwing stuff. Everybody was doing whatever they wanted. And\n   then they found a substitute teacher, but the kids were so horrible that\n   the substitute teacher left crying and didn't come back.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So this other teacher, le decian el padrino, [they called him the\n   godfather] because literally, era el padrino [he was the godfather] like\n   everybody there. So, he comes in with like typical macho Mexicano with his\n   mustache beard, bien cabron. [a right bastard] And he comes in there and\n   everybody's like, \u201coh el padrino viene el padrino.\u201d [oh, the godfather, the\n   godfather\u2019s coming] So like Everybody's like quiet. And one of them, he was\n   just like, \"I don't care, que esto y el otro\" [this and that] He was\n   fucking ... I'm sorry. [Laughs].\n \n \n   Jeimmy: He was from one table to another. He was literally like on top of\n   the tables jumping from one table to another. So el padrino comes in and\n   he's like, \"Get down from there.\" And he's like, \"No, que esto y el otro.\"\n   He's like, \"Get down from there.\" \"No, I'm not going to get down. What are\n   you going to do about it?\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: He takes his belt off and he's like, \u201cOne, two, three.\u201d And you\n   just see him just sit down. Like nothing happened. And then he starts\n   putting order. Like, \"I'm tired of you guys always doing whatever you guys\n   want, que esto y el otro.\" And everybody's like, \"Oh my God. Did he just\n   whoop him?\u201d \u201cYeah, he did.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So it stayed quiet for a while, but then he left. Then everybody\n   started making fun of the kid that got whooped by a teacher. And yeah, that\n   was basically like the most impact made during my middle school experience\n   here in Mexico.\n \n \n   Tim: And then you went to high school after?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I went to high school. Yeah.\n \n \n   Tim: Was that similar to what middle school was?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: No, nothing. Kids or teenagers were more open minded. Instead of\n   making fun of me because I knew English, they would be like, \"Oh, you know\n   English. Okay, let's hang out. I can teach you Spanish, you can teach me\n   English. I can teach you math and you can teach me English.\" So they were\n   more like, \"Okay, let's help out each other.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: And the teachers, they were all so different. The English teacher\n   was like, \"Oh, okay, you know English. Perfect. Just do one examen [exam]\n   and whatever you get on that examen, va ser tu calificaci\u00f3n para todo el\n   semestre.\" [exam will be your grade for the semester]And I'm like, \"Okay,\n   10, there you go.\" A 10 for the whole semester. I didn't have to go to the\n   classes because the teacher already knew that I knew English.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So she was like, \"If you want to be here, to help the other\n   students, it's fine with me.\" So yeah, I would just go whenever I wanted to\n   and help out the other students, and basically that's it. So my experience\n   in high school was a lot better. A lot better than middle school.\n \n \n   Tim: Besides school when you came back, was it hard to like reintegrate\n   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into\n   myself. Because specifically in high school, I started... there's Spanish\n   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're\n   like, \"y tienes carnales?\u201d \" And I'm like, \"carnales, what's that?\" \"si\n   tienes hermanos?\u201d And I'm like, \"Oh yeah, I have two brothers.\" Oh, okay.\n   And they would use those words, no?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. \u201cOh yeah. carnal significa\n   [carnal means] brother.\u201d What other words did they use? They would use\n   expressions like, \u201cay ese hombre es un Don Juan,\u201d [that man is a Don Juan]\n   and I'm like, \"Who's Don Juan?\" And they're like, \"Oh no. It just means\n   that he's a player,\" and words like that. So I was like, \"Oh, okay. This is\n   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most\u2014I\n   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, \"Hey\n   Jeimmy,\" because everybody was like in break, \"Hey Jeimmy.\" I'm like,\n   \u201cque?\u201d He's like, \"ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,\" [did you manage to ring\n   the doorbell] and I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" He's like, \"Yeah, Jeimmy,\n   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?\" and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, \u201cI\n   don't know what you're talking about.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: \"Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.\" [have you\n   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, \"mi casa no tiene timbre.\u201d\n   [my house doesn\u2019t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,\n   and I'm like, \"Oh my God, what did I say?\" So later on, I tell my friend,\n   I'm like, \"What did he mean?\" And she's laughing at me and she can't stop\n   laughing at me. And then she's like, \"Okay, he basically asked you if\n   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a\n   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.\" And I was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n"

My dad, he still has that mentality of wanting to go back.\n   And it's because when he left Mexico, he may have a -- una profesion. [a\n   profession] He got over there and, like I told you, he was pitching\n   peaches, cherries. Then he was working at a fabric. But then, one day, he\n   saw a sign that said, \"We need welders.\" And he's like, \"Oh, necesitan\n   soldadores, [the need welders] but I don't know how to weld. But I'm going\n   to go anyway.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, he found the supervisor and he's like, \"Oh, you're Mexican,\n   huh?\" He's like, \u201cYeah.\u201d \"Oh, okay. Well then.\" And my dad is like,\n   \u201c[Nervous noise].\u2019 It was horrible, but he's like, \"Okay, I'm going to show\n   you how to weld.\" So my dad started learning how to be a welder and became\n   an ingeniero industrial. [industrial engineer] So, he knows a lot of things\n   that is not very common here in Mexico. He knows how to do it.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, he would start looking for jobs where he said, \u201cIf I weld this,\n   just to do it, because this whole thing costs like 10,000 pesos, they're\n   already like, \u2018I'm getting paid, I don't know, 3000 for it. Y nada mas\u2019\u201d\n   Like 10 minutes of doing it, the company was already getting paid thousands\n   of pesos for it. And he was only getting paid like 1,000 and change a week.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, he's like, \"I'm working for this company that's making\n   thousands of pesos, y a mi nada mas me pagan 1000 pesos a la semana. \"\n   [they are only paying me 1000 pesos a week] So he didn't like that. He's\n   like, \"They're not paying me enough for what I know how to do.\" So he\n   started looking for more and more jobs, and he started noticing that jobs\n   that have nothing to do what he does pay more than what he actually knows\n   how to do.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So he became like chofer de metrobus,[bus driver] he became like\n   taxista, [taxi driver] and he's like, \"I don't like this. I don't like\n   being a chofer. [driver] I want to do what I like doing. But it's not paid\n   well here, so I want to go back to the States and work over there.\" So\n   yeah, that's basically why he wants to go back.\n \n \n   Tim: If your parents do go back, do you think you might or you\u2014\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Oh no. We had that conversation before. I told them, \"Yo me quedo\n   aqu\u00ed en la casa.

Everything's\n   so different.\n \n \n   Tim: Are there any like specific American foods that you miss?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: That I miss? Not really. A couple years back, I used to miss like\n   cranberry sauce, I used to miss gravy, I used to miss candies, like salt\n   water taffy, like a whole bunch of candies that here in Mexico don't exist.\n   But then the years pass by and you stop, I don't know, ya no se te antoja,\n   [you don\u2019t crave it] You're like, \"Okay, it's fine.\"\n \n \n   Tim: Okay. So besides the food, is there anything that you miss a lot about\n   the United States?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I miss the cleanness. It's true that it's greener on the other\n   side. Everybody can notice that. I miss how you could go to the park and\n   everything was like, the grass was all green. You would see like\u2014well at\n   least where I used to live, there was a small pond where you can go throw\n   bread at ducks. I miss the security that you feel when you call 911 and in\n   five minutes, the cops are there.\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I think that's something I really miss a lot, because here, you\n   could say, \"Oh my God, if something happens to me and they call the cops,\n   they are going to be here like an hour later, and they're not even going to\n   be here prepared. They're just going to like, nada mas es presencia\n   [they\u2019re just present] because they're not even prepared for it.\" So I\n   guess that's something that I missed too.\n \n \n   Tim: So, did you trust the police in the United States?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yeah. I always grew up believing that police were good men. Police\n   are different from ICE. So, La Migra was different from a regular cop. So I\n   would always trust cops.\n \n \n   Tim: And here you don't trust?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: No, no. No, aqui no. [no, no, here no.] At least I haven't seen a\n   cop do a good deed. You usually see them like trying to stop people just to\n   check them and see if they have anything on them.\n \n \n   Tim: Is there anything that you don't miss about the United States?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Something I don't miss about the States?\n \n \n   Tim: Is there something that you hated about it when you were there?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Well, no, not really. I enjoyed the time I was there, and they\n   would tell me, \"Do you want to go back?\" I would probably say no, but I\n   mean it was nice.\n \n \n   Tim: Why wouldn't you want to go?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Because I feel free here. I have my family here. I might not see a\n   grass and ponds and so what, but I see my city and el Monumento de la\n   Revoluci\u00f3n , el Angel. I've been to other states like Cancun. Cancun is\n   beautiful. I would rather be in Cancun than in the States. And you also\n   make dollars in Cancun. So I mean it's nice.\n \n \n   Tim: So, do you see yourself as more American or more Mexican?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: I would say both. [Chuckles]. That was a tough one. Yeah. Both.\n   Because I mean, I have Mexican blood. You can see me physically and I look\n   Mexican. But my taste in music isn't that Mexican. My ideal isn't as the\n   same as a Mexican mind. And well, yeah, I mean you can say I'm like an\n   Oreo. [Laughs].\n"

I hadn't talked to her on the phone\n   ever, because supposedly when she called, my grandma would say that I was\n   asleep or I was playing outside or anything else, but that I wasn't there.\n \n \n   Anita: Why?\n \n \n   Joana: That was because I stayed with my grandma from my dad's side.\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Joana: My dad never called either. He never supported me economically.\n   Yeah, they actually did have a fight over me, a legal fight, because my\n   grandma didn't want to let me go, but she was my mother. So, under the law,\n   I was supposed to be with her. Not with my grandma. Basically, I had to\n   leave with her, because they couldn't do anything to hold me back.\n \n \n   Anita: Whoa.\n \n \n   Joana: Yeah. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anita: That's really difficult for a little girl.\n \n \n   Joana: It's been crazy. Pretty much. I cried. I remember that my mom went\n   to pick me up and she basically stole me, technically, because I really\n   didn't know her. I didn't want to leave, but I didn't have another choice.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you kicking and screaming?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, I definitely was. I remember I opened my arms and my legs when\n   they were trying to force me in the taxi, because I didn't want to leave. I\n   was crying and yelling and screaming and I couldn't do anything. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: So, did it get better once you got to ____?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes, because I got to know her and, well, she was my mother. I\n   didn't have any other choice but to get to know her. I mean, it was\n   difficult because until this day I don't really have a lot of\n   communications with her. I still don't have that connection. Pretty much,\n   she spent her time working so we didn't really have time to actually sit\n   down. She didn't ask, \"How are you doing? How is school?\" Anything. \"Do you\n   have problems? Are you having trouble?\" I mean, nothing.\n \n \n   Anita: So, why did she want to take you?\n \n \n   Joana: Well, she said that I was her daughter and that she loved me. Well,\n   she was sending money, she was taking care of me in a way, but I just\n   wasn't living with her. But it wasn't her choice either, because when she\n   left, she couldn't take me at that time. She tried to get me with her, and\n   she actually did. So, it was basically that.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you think her lack of affection, as you've described it, was\n   because you didn't spend your first few years together?\n \n \n   Joana: I think so. I think that has a lot to do with it, because I kind of\n   see the way she treats my brother and my sister\u2014she had them since they\n   were born\u2014every year, every day, every single minute. With me it wasn't\n   like that. She already was remarried with my stepdad, of course. It was\n   really difficult for me.\n"

I was so afraid because I have seen cases where kids have been\n   bullied. My brother was bullied. I didn't want to go through that. I was so\n   scared, and I didn't want to leave my family.\n \n \n   Anita: You mean you didn't want to get deported?\n \n \n   Joana: Yeah, I didn't want to get deported at all. I don't think anyone\n   does. No one wants to go through all the process. It's pretty scary.\n   [Emotional].\n \n \n   Anita: This was a secret that you kept?\n \n \n   Joana: Being undocumented was my darkest secret. I didn't want anyone to\n   find out. I was terrified. I didn't want to be separated from my family\n   again, [Emotional] because I didn't grow up with them for about four years.\n   It was extremely hard. Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: I can't imagine... I mean, you talk about fear, you talk about being\n   ashamed, and then there's the issue about having to keep a secret.\n \n \n   Joana: Imagine\u2026 I don't think anyone being a citizen has a fear of\n   anything. They're free to go anywhere they want. They're free to do\n   whatever they want. They can study all the way to where they want to get,\n   and we don't. We don't get that opportunity. [Crying]. I don't think anyone\n   should go through that. It's just, it's not fair. I had dreams when I was a\n   little kid. I wanted to be someone in life. I wanted to have a career. That\n   was probably the main reason of why I decided to drop out because I\n   figured, I mean, I'm not going to get to go to college, I'm not going to\n   get to have a career here, so why do I even try? They make us feel less,\n   like we don't matter at all, like our lives are just worthless, and that's\n   not the case. We contribute to everything. We try to follow the law. Still,\n   that doesn't count. That doesn't matter at all. It's really, really hard.\n   It's extremely hard.\n \n \n   Anita: If you'd had the chance, what would you have become?\n \n \n   Joana: I wanted to be a veterinarian. That was my dream. Or a teacher. I\n   love kids. I love to teach. I love to help everyone. If I see someone\n   struggling, I want to help them, and I can't. I felt like I could never do\n   that. It's really hard seeing how some people don't even value that. A lot\n   of American citizens don't look at it that way. They really don't care.\n   They're like, \"Oh, well, you're not from here. So, we can't do anything.\"\n   That's just it. That's the reality for a lot, a lot, a lot of people.\n"

I mean, even if I finished\n   high school, I wasn't going to be able to keep on studying what I wanted to\n   study. I had good grades in school. I mean, at the end of the day, what\n   does it really mean? If it's not worth anything. I mean, you can do your\n   best. You can at the top of your class and it still doesn't mean anything.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you at the top of your class?\n \n \n   Joana: One of them. In certain classes, yes, I was the best. In math class,\n   in other classes [Chuckle], but in others I was like the second.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you were a really good student?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. I always tried my best.

I mean, I kind of regret not finishing it, but it\n   wasn't going to help me anyways.\n \n \n   Anita: You were angry?\n \n \n   Joana: Yes. At the laws. They say it's a free country, but it's not free\n   for us. We got to work every day. You wake up at 6:00 A.M., you get home at\n   8:00, and it's still the same thing. Every day. No one sees that. No one.\n   No one pays attention to what we go through. What we struggle. Some\n   Hispanics really can't afford a lot of things, and no one tries to help\n   them out. And when they try like right now\u2026. I mean, Donald Trump really\n   took a lot of things away. A lot of advantages, a lot of help, gone. We\n   can't get them back. That's it.\n \n \n   Anita: We're going to fight. You have some Americans here on your side.\n \n \n   Joana: Thank you. It really does mean a lot. It seems like a small help,\n   but it's a lot because no one has ever came up to me and asked, \"How are\n   you doing? How do think that's going to affect you? What do you think's\n   going to happen?\" No one asks. They're just like, \"Oh, well, you don't\n   belong here. You're not from here. You shouldn't even be here.\" That's how\n   they treat us, and that's reality. You can't say anything back to them\n   because at the end of the day it's kind of true, but it shouldn't be that\n   way. They say we have equal rights. I don't see it. [Chuckle]. I really\n   don't. We're not equal to them. We're not equal, and we work a lot harder.\n   We really try our best. We try to follow everything step by step at the\n   foot of everything. That doesn't help us. Some actually do become American\n   citizens, and every time you see a case like that, it's like, \"Wow,\n   congratulations. You deserve it.\" Because who doesn't want to? Who doesn't\n   want to be treated like an American citizen? We're not treated that way. We\n   always get discriminated by something, and that's not fair. I don't think\n   anyone, from any country, from anywhere in the world should ever get\n   treated that way. I just don't believe it.\n"

We live in fear. You don't trust anyone. What they lose is\n   workers. We pay taxes. They lose, maybe, ties to certain things in Mexico\n   because they do have to export, import.

But then this happened.\n \n \n   Anne: So what's this?\n \n \n   Jose: A transition in life.\n \n \n   Anne: What?\n \n \n   Jose: A transition in life.\n \n \n   Anne: Yeah. So how did you end up back here?\n \n \n   Jose: I was driving. It was like a Sunday, no a Saturday. I was with my\n   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was\n   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and\n   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was\n   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and\n   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I\n   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.\n   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to\n   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I\n   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent\n   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was\n   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,\n   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though\n   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the\n   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it\n   was my best option.\n \n \n   Anne: So you said they pulled you over for speeding and saw you didn't have\n   a license. And did you say they already had a hold on you for ICE?\n \n \n   Jose: Yeah, no, as soon as the county takes you to the county jail... That\n   county alone is actually known to work with immigration. So they have an\n   immigration office within that county jail. So, I mean, as soon as you step\n   in, they... An hour in, they fingerprint you, whatever, they bring you out\n   to ICE interview, and at the ICE interview, they directly tell you that you\n   have a hold on immigration. There is no point in paying your bond or bail,\n   whatever. You're detained by ICE.\n \n \n   Anne: So that was the only thing you ever did wrong? Or you ever got caught\n   doing wrong?\n \n \n   Jose: No, actually, I had a verbal offense with an officer, which I fought,\n   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also\n   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration\n   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.\n   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, \"Oh, they paid your bail.\n   You're good.\" I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was\n   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that\n   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at\n   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about\n   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got\n   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My\n   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.\n   And we're fine. They're like, \"Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.\n   It'll be fine.\" But we were dead wrong.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Joseph: School, friends, family. Best memories of me are always with my\n   friends. I wasn't really close to my family. My family was very difficult\n   to live with. The only reason I actually was a very good scholar was\n   because my dad didn't like for us to come home with a B, he would say that\n   he was laid off, he would work his ass off for us to actually learn\n   something in school. And that a B is not worth it, that he wanted A's. So\n   if we did get a B, it was a beating for sure. I'm not talking about the\n   little slap on the wrist it was a real good beating.\n \n \n   Joseph: My mom was, she didn't have a lot of things to do. She's always\n   been a hustler. So she always sold products to show up catalogs, stuff like\n   that, like little household items. And she has always been very resentful\n   that she came to the States. And it's been very hard living with that\n   person because she's always bitter. And that bitterness was always giving\n   out, and beatings and yelling. So since I was little, I always try to stay\n   away from home.\n \n \n   Joseph: I started working since I was 11, because I didn't want to stay\n   home anymore. So I started finding my own way of money because my father\n   taught me that if I wanted things I had to pay for it. So they would never\n   give me allowance, they would never give me money, they would just only\n   give me enough for the transportation. And when the New York started giving\n   the school aid, I mean, they didn't give me any more money, so they\n   wouldn't give me anything. And after that, it was just very difficult to\n   actually live with both of those types of people. When I grew older, my\n   father was very scared of me because of what I had become. He knew that he\n   couldn't push me around anymore. He knew that very clearly. And I let him\n   know that too, because I was not very happy with him after seeing him after\n   six years.\n \n \n   Joseph: So he tried to impose that father authority. And I told him that,\n   no, he lost the privilege. My mother also learned the hard way that she\n   wasn't able to talk to me anymore the way she did when I was younger. And I\n   went through every kind of thing imaginable by mom. My mom threw plates,\n   tools, bamboo sticks, anything she could really get her hands on to make\n   her point that she was not to be messed with. She even threw an iron at our\n   heads once. I remember me and my brother ducking at that. So I guess all\n   those memories and all those childhood relations actually made me very\n   aware that\u2026since very little that I was in here for myself, that I didn't\n   count nobody.\n \n \n   Joseph: And the beauty part was when I met my friends, friends that kinda\n   had the same situations or were living the same lifestyles, we grew too\n   close together. We were always working together or working to become\n   better, working to get out of the hood, not become those kinds of children,\n   prodigies of being a drug dealer or the gang bangers, stuff like that. So\n   that was really cool. So we actually had this kind of friends and that was\n   the best part growing up, but having to share that suffering with someone\n   else, that's probably going through the same thing or differently, but in\n   the same, we're all suffering. And out of that suffering, you make a unity\n   and you make friendships. You make something bad good. And my best memories\n   have always been playing, hanging with all my friends, parties with my\n   friends, doing things with all my friends that have been my best memories.\n   I have good memories of my family when we have reunions, but they're very\n   little, but the best memories have always been that I can count on friends.\n"

I actually came back because I gave up on the United States. There's\n   a lot of things that when you're in the military, you see, you just keep it\n   on the down low.

That identification we cannot get because they are in elections\n   and we are not allowed to get in until the election is over, which is in\n   July. Ever since March, I haven't been able to get an identification where\n   I can reestablish my life precisely because I cannot open a bank account, I\n   cannot get a job. When you get a job here, they want you to get that\n   identification.

For Christ's sake, they don't\n   have an identification to get a job. I just know of a friend of mine, she\n   was interviewed twice, and getting very good bilingual jobs. And she\n   couldn't take them because she didn't have the identification to take the\n   job. And that, it hurts. It hurts very much to see people struggle like\n   that.

How can they afford it if they cannot get\n   a job? If they cannot get a job, if they can't get a way to make their\n   living, how in the world are they going to do?

I just hate the idea of her leaving\n   for a long time, for almost a year, on the basic training, and I'm not\n   going to be able to be with her to say goodbye or give her a hug or\n   anything like that. And my youngest, she's a junior in high school. She has\n   two more years of high school and she wants to go to college.\n   3)  \n   Juan: Well, my wife, she's amazing. We've been married twenty-one years and\n   I miss her every minute. Just, twenty-one years, we spend many, many things\n   together, good and bad, and I miss her very much. I think that's the\n   hardest part, right there. Not being with her is the hardest part of all\n   this. I love my children and all, I love my kids and all that, I miss them\n   madly. But my wife, to me, she's everything. And I just miss her very much.\n"

And when you\n   get there, you get there usually with no money, usually in need of\n   everything. So you take the first job that comes your way. And it was at a\n   restaurant, an Italian restaurant. And I was a busboy, I was cleaning\n   tables and helping in the kitchen, helping the waiters. It was basically at\n   a restaurant.\n \n \n   Adrian: Oh, good. That's the only job that you have in the United States or\n   did you do more jobs? Do you do other kinds of work?\n \n \n   Juan: No. At first I had jobs like that restaurant-wise, but then since I\n   know how to drive commercial vehicles, I was able to get a job driving a\n   vehicle and I drove a bobtail truck, delivering gasoline and diesel. And I\n   did that for a long time. And I took many driving jobs because of the\n   commercial license that I used to have. I used to have several jobs driving\n   commercial vehicles. But then when I got married, my wife didn't want me to\n   do anymore that job because it was kind of dangerous. So I stopped doing\n   it. And I was facing the possibility of getting another job, basically\n   driving or doing something else. I picked something else and I started my\n   own business.\n \n \n   Juan: I started a real estate investing business. I was buying and selling\n   houses. I was fixing them and remodeling them and I was selling them to\n   people that were looking to buy a house for the first time. And I was doing\n   quite well until I couldn't do it anymore because, since I was\n   undocumented, I couldn't renew my driver's license. And when you don't have\n   a license in the state of Texas, pretty much you can't do anything. You\n   cannot travel, you cannot open a bank account, you cannot do pretty much\n   anything. You can't go to a bank and do anything because you don't have\n   identification. And the worst part was that in my business I needed to\n   notarize documents, I needed to borrow money from banks to purchase the\n   houses, and I needed a credit card to buy my materials to remodel my houses\n   and all that stuff. And since I didn't have anything like that, I couldn't\n   do nothing anymore, absolutely nothing. And it was a very, very hard time\n   for like a year that I couldn't do nothing because I didn't have an\n   identification.\n"

They think like their life is continuing in the U.S.\n   without them, and that can be really difficult to reconcile with being in\n   Mexico too.\n \n \n   Weco: I had it like that. My first year I had it like that. I would look at\n   the time, and I'd be like, \"Down there it's this time.\" I would live off\n   that time instead of living off this time. Every day I'd be like, \"If I was\n   down there, I'd be doing this. If I was eating right now, I'd be eating\n   this.\" My mind wouldn't be here. My body would be here, but my mind\n   wouldn't be over... Till it just clicked in. I was like, \"Man, you're\n   screwed, dude. You're not going nowhere. Just get that shit out your mind\n   and let\u2019s face reality.\" That's what I'm doing: facing reality.\n \n \n   Isabel: I think that takes a lot of willpower though.\n \n \n   Weco: It does, but what other option do we have? A lot of people would\n   rather just live off a dream or live off something else instead of facing\n   reality and looking at it like you know, this is life. I have no other\n   option. This is what I got to deal with. Some other people would rather\n   just give themselves a visuality or a dream that ah, things will get better\n   or this or that. I look at it no, life is life. If it gets better, it gets\n   better. If it don't, it don't. But at the end of the way, you're living\n   life. At the end of the day, this is one life we have. Why waste it? It's\n   one time. We ain't gonna to live this life again. Why waste it? I had my\n   fun in the States. I won't lie. I did everything I wanted to. Once I got\n   deported, I just, you know, all I do here is work. I smoke weed. I like\n   weed. I don't lie.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: That's it.\n \n \n   Isabel: Do you think weed is just something to relax here and have fun, or\n   do you think it gives you a break from where you are?\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, it can do both, depending also on the person. Every person's\n   body is different. Every person takes it different. Me, I actually take it\n   to relax me. Sometimes I actually just take it just to have fun, relax and\n   chill, depending on the moment. There are days I work when I get so\n   frustrated I just need to smoke to just relax my mind where I'm just like,\n   \"All right, I'm cool.\" Because it brings me to where, \"Fuck it. It was just\n   a phone call. It was his job. Fuck \u2018em. It is what it is.\" And then when\n   I'm with friends, we're just like, \"Oh yeah, let's smoke. Just laughs.\"\n   Right there it's just haha, giggles, laughs, you're just clowning on\n   people.\n \n \n   Isabel: Everything's funny.\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, everything's funny. You're just roasting. And I'm one of those.\n   I get to roasting everybody. I just like to have fun. So, yeah. sometimes I\n   do use weed to get my depression out.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: Sometimes it comes around when you get depressed being out here on\n   your own. But like I said, I just smoke. When I smoke, it goes away. My\n   mentality switches to, \"Look, you're on your own. Why suffer? Why cry?\" My\n   mentality just switches quick, and I stop being depressed about it. It is\n   what it is. Why?\n"

But no, things worked out for a reason. You caught me for a\n   reason.\" Everything happened for a reason. And like I told the judge before\n   they deported me, I was like, \"Look, Your Honor, I turned myself in. I got\n   the record of not turning myself in. I actually got a record of escaping,\n   running from the law during transportation, during whatever the situation\n   is. But that's my record, running.\"\n \n \n   Weco: And I told him just like that. \"I'm actually trying to change. I got\n   a son that was just born. He's not that many months old. It's something\n   big, you know something big for me.\" But all I remember is actually him\n   asking my baby mama, \"Does he got insurance?\" She was like, \"Yeah. Anything\n   would happen to him, insurance will cover him. He don't need his dad.\" So I\n   just stood quiet. I was just like, \"All right.\" My judge, my lawyer was\n   like, \"Anything else?\" I just told him... I really went off. I just told\n   the judge, I was like, \"Think what you want. Feel how you want. But at the\n   end of the day, somehow, some way, I'm a gonna to come back. You can take\n   me away from my mom, anybody, but not my son. At the end of the day, I'm a\n   gonna to come back. You're a judge. You've just got a black thing on. You\n   ain't nobody to tell me shit. You ain't nobody. This courtroom ain't\n   nobody. These handcuffs ain't nobody.\n \n \n   Isabel: Did you say this?\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, I said that during courtroom.\n \n \n   Isabel: Wow. You really did tell them. You're really honest. Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, I told him. My lawyer kept telling me to be quiet, and I told\n   my lawyer, \"No. Fuck that. You know, They're going-\"\n \n \n   Isabel: It's already been [crosstalk 00:24:00].\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, I'm already deported. What else are they going to do? Keep me\n   here another month? I don't think they're going to want that. They want me\n   out of here. So, I just let the judge know how I felt. I told him, \"Either\n   way, somehow I'm going to come back, legal or illegal.\" At the end of the\n   day, you're not going to stop no Mexican from coming over. No one will.\n   Never.\n \n \n   Isabel: The president's learning that the hard way, I think.\n \n \n   Weco: The way I look at it, and I told him, I'm like, \"I actually feel like\n   we're better than you mentality wise, because you're building walls. You're\n   building anything, underground, whatever, and we're still coming over.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: Still coming over. Somehow, some way, we're still coming over. Either\n   it's 10 people, or there's five people. It's either one, or it's 20. But\n   we're coming over, and you're not going to stop it.\"\n \n \n   Isabel: I'm sure he loved to hear that.\n \n \n   Weco: I'd love to pass out to Trump too.\n"

So, I prefer being\n   in the hood because the hood knows what it's like. The hood suffers. I've\n   been through not having no money.

Just because we don't have a paper to validate our\n   residency in the States doesn't mean we don't like being there, doesn't\n   mean we don't love the US. In my school we used to always pledge our\n   allegiance to the flag, you know?

I love\n   all the opportunities I have. It's just that one paper that I don't have.\n   So just to have them be a lot more open minded and open hearted to people\n   like that because, honestly, all those things that are said that Mexico\n   sends their worst, that's not true. I know a lot of people that were in my\n   high school that were actually getting to go on a foreign exchange student\n   to Japan and to other places because they were the top of the class or top\n   of the state. They were going to the best universities and they were all\n   immigrants. So just be a little more open minded to a lot of people like\n   that. And not just Mexican immigrants. Immigrants in general. A lot of\n   people fear immigrants from other places but it's like, no, you don't think\n   we go to the States with fear? You don't think we're scared of being there?\n   Honestly, we are. My parents went to the States without knowing one word of\n   English. So it's scary. It's scary on both sides but just be a little more\n   open to people like that. Yeah.\n"

We\n   actually got detained four times before being able to cross.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. One time the border patrol was actually very nice to us and\n   gave us water and all that, but that was a very long time ago.\n \n \n   Lizzy: And you say one time they were nice to you out of four times?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you know what the other times were like?\n \n \n   Laila: Well, mostly from my mom that she has actually told me most of what\n   happened. She says that the first couple of times we were detained, they\n   were just taken back and left at the border. Just go away, go home. There\n   was one time she was actually carrying me. She actually carried me the\n   whole time because I was three so and she says it was around rain time. The\n   shrubs were very tall and all the spines and all that. She didn't want me\n   to get injured, but she actually fell on a rock and got a hole in her knee\n   and she couldn't walk. When the border patrol saw that, they aided her and\n   they gave us water and they wanted to help her. They couldn't really give\n   her medical treatment, but they just helped her get back across the border.\n   She says that one of them told her to go home. Not risk her kids and there\n   was no reason for that. [Pause] There was no reason for that [Chuckle], but\n   I guess my mom says she's very stubborn. So she wanted to reunite her\n   family and we were able to cross on the fifth time [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow. Your mom sounds like a strong woman.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, she is. She is.

I actually went to a high school\n   where they had that program. They had marine biology there, so it was\n   pretty cool. We had a lot of fish tanks and we were able to see a lot of\n   things. Our school offered scuba diving lessons for free, they would take\n   us to the Catalina Islands to scuba dive in California. But I wasn't able\n   to fulfill that dream of going to the Catalina Islands because of the\n   deportation of my dad and all of that.

Yeah. I actually wanted to finish high school and go to\n   UCLA [University of California, Los Angeles]. I think they had a marine\n   biology program there, and I wanted to go to UCLA. I had already told my\n   parents, and they were like, \"You're crazy. You're going to go to\n   California by yourself. Like, what are you going to do there?\"\n \n \n   Laila: And it's like, I don't know, but I want to be there. I want to do\n   that for a living. I love the ocean, I completely love all of that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I do too [Laila laughs], it's one of my big passions too, I get\n   that. Yeah.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, so I had already had something planned out you could say. But\n   life just comes at you in a different way. So I couldn't finish that. I\n   looked for a program here in Mexico, but they were all in the Canc\u00fan area,\n   the beach areas, and very expensive. So I had to put it, a complete stop on\n   that dream and just, I guess, grow up [Chuckles].\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Laila: I was living in Arizona, and at that point the Sheriff Joe Arpaio\n   was actually the current sheriff of Arizona, and my high school was mostly\n   Latino. Mostly immigrants. We were all mostly from fourteen to seventeen, a\n   couple of eighteen-year-olds. And there was one day that there was somebody\n   circling, there was a rumor circling that there was going to be a raid\n   close to the school. We thought well, it's a school. Why are you going to\n   come raid a school? That wasn't even a thought for us.\n \n \n   Laila: We went to school, and at the time that we were going out, there\n   were sheriffs surrounding the school, stopping parents, stopping students,\n   seniors. There was a senior, a girl that we all kind of knew, she was\n   really nice to everybody, she got stopped because the sheriff said that her\n   back light was out or something like that and it was just an excuse to stop\n   her. She didn't have anything. She didn't have papers, so when the sheriff\n   told her \"I need to see an ID, I need to see something. She said, \"Well I\n   don't have any papers.\" So, at that moment she got taken in and sent to a\n   detention center.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Oh my God. From a school.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, directly from our high school. An in a couple\u2014\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you remember, like what did you do that day? Did you know that\n   this was happening as you were coming out of school?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. I told my parents not to get close to the school. A lot of\n   students had to walk home far distances, scared of their parents going for\n   them because they stayed out there for a while and they were stopping cars\n   coming out of the school. They stopped the teachers, they stopped everybody\n   just because of the color of their skin. You got stopped and you got asked\n   for papers or ID, even though a lot of us knew it was illegal for them to\n   stay outside of a school and ask for papers.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Absolutely.\n \n \n   Laila: They still did it and if you refused to answer, they would still\n   take you in. It was just mostly a lot of kids leaving school through back\n   doors, through the fields, the baseball fields, all of that. They were just\n   jumping the fences and leaving because we were really scared to get\n   stopped. I remember I had to tell my mom to stay away from the school\n   because this was happening. And I actually had a friend who was born in the\n   States and her parents were there legally who offered to take a couple of\n   kids home because they saw that everything that was happening and that they\n   were stopping, like relentlessly, people. Just asking for papers, and so\n   they had to carpool a couple of kids home because their parents couldn't\n   come close to the school.\n \n \n   Lizzy: That's so awful. That's terrifying.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Where? What part of Arizona?\n \n \n   Laila: ___. ____ and that was just the start of everything. My high\n   school's attendance dropped drastically from 2,500 kids to not even a\n   thousand because they started raiding the schools spontaneously. Just, they\n   wouldn't even tell anybody, and that sheriff started it all in Arizona. A\n   lot of people hated him [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: [Affirmative sound]\n \n \n   Laila: Because he was separating families. I remember just telling my mom,\n   \"I don't want to go back to school if that means putting you at risk, or\n   putting one of my brothers at risk, I just don't want to go back.\" And\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Lizzy: I'm so sorry. Is there anything that, so we were talking about the\n   government. Is there anything that you wish just average American people\n   understood about migrant families?\n \n \n   Laila: What I would personally like them to understand is, we're not bad\n   people. I mean, a lot of people do bad things, yeah. But it's not because\n   we're immigrant. Everybody chooses what to do. They choose their own path.\n   A lot of immigrant families, like I mentioned, go for a better future for\n   their children and for themselves. A lot of them leave their home countries\n   not because they want to, but because they have to because of violence,\n   because of war, because of a lot of things. A lot of people in the US think\n   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they\n   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think\n   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting\n   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to\n   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed\n   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He\n   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside\n   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out\n   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, \"Get\n   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck\" at gunpoint. And he\n   was like, \"Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my\n   kids are in the car.\" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in\n   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I\n   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he\n   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I'm so sorry.\n \n \n   Laila: So yeah, my cousins had to grow up without their father. It was very\n   difficult. And I wish a lot of families in the US would just think about\n   it. What it would be like to go through something like that. It's not easy.\n \n \n   Lizzy: How old were you when that happened to your uncle?\n \n \n   Laila: I was about two. I was about two years old, before we went to the\n   States. That was another reason why my dad decided to go to the States,\n   because he saw that and he said, \"You can't have progress here because if\n   they see that you have something new, if other people see that you have\n   something that you have barely bought or something, they're going to want\n   it and they're going to want to take it away.\" And to leave your family, or\n   to have your father get killed over a car, it sounds stupid to me, but it's\n   a reality a lot of people face. To get shot down for a car, a motorcycle,\n   for a phone. For a phone. I mean, it's a phone. A lot of people take it for\n   granted, but if you walk around with your phone in hand, you'll get robbed\n   at gunpoint for it. A lot of people don't see that or don't understand\n   that. That a lot of migrant families leave because it is very violent in\n   their home countries. And that's something that I would like for them to\n   try to understand, just a little bit. A lot of violence is just scary, and\n   you wouldn't want your kids to get robbed at gunpoint outside of their\n   middle school because, I don't know, some guys just want their phone. So,\n   yeah [Chuckles].\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   is there anything you wish Mexican people understood about families like\n   yours that went to the US and came back?\n \n \n   Laila: I would like them to understand that we don't have cash stashed\n   somewhere. It's not like we went to the States and we came back rich.\n   That's illogical to think. And just to have them be a little more\n   understanding of the kids that come back from the States. Personally, I\n   went through a lot of discrimination from my own people because I didn't\n   perfectly know or understand the language. So, I would like them to try to\n   ease on to those kinds of people that come back from the States. And don't\n   think that, oh you're made of cash or you're not Mexican because you don't\n   speak Spanish. I mean it's not that, it's that we're used to something\n   completely different. We went to school in the States, so you couldn't\n   speak Spanish in school because all of your teachers spoke English.\n   Everybody communicated in English so if you know the basics, but you don't\n   know more than that, just don't be mean to those people. It's not fair.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Just like how we hate it when people in the States, if they hear\n   someone speaking Spanish they tell them, \"Don't speak Spanish here, speak\n   English.\" It sounds like kind of that same kind of discrimination happens\n   here if you're speaking English.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. I have seen a lot of people make fun of other people for\n   speaking English, and it gets me very angry because it's like, okay so\n   you're on them because they speak English, what does that have to do with\n   anything? If they had the chance to learn another language, that's cool.\n   That's good for them, you know? But they hear other people speaking\n   English, or I've seen British people here going on tours and all that,\n   seeing the city, and other Mexican people see them, or hear them, they\n   start making fun of them. And it's like, why are you making fun of them?\n   There's no point. I have gotten into some conflicts with my cousins,\n   specifically, because they think it\u2019s funny for other people to speak\n   English when for me, it's a privilege to have been able to speak another\n   language other than Spanish. For me, it's an advantage. For my cousins,\n   it's a laughing matter, and it does get me angry because I have told them,\n   \"I mean, you wouldn't like to be in the States and speak your native\n   language and have someone make fun of you and tell you don't speak Spanish.\n   No. That's your native language, that's what you know.\" Don't make fun of\n   other people for that, it's pointless to just make fun of other people for\n   situations like that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: [Affirmative sound] When your family got back to Mexico, was there,\n   did you receive any help from the government or any organizations as a\n   migrant family returning?\n \n \n   Laila: No. None at all. None at all. I think the government here in Mexico\n   also thinks that if you are coming from the States, you're made of money.\n   And they think that you will have everything resolved, and you have\n   everything on a silver platter because you come from the States. And it's\n   nothing like that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Often the opposite.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, most likely the opposite. When you get deported you can't\n   bring anything with you, it's not like you can bring your house with you\n   [Chuckles]. We had our house in the States, it was ours. Well, it was my\n   mom's. She had bought it and she was paying for it but when we got\n   deported, my brothers weren't able to continue paying it, so it got taken\n   away. So my mom said, \"It's not like I could have brought it over here. If\n   I could've bought it over here I would have because it was mine.\" She said\n   all of our hard work and all of our, everything we gave up to have\n   something of our own, it just completely went away.\n \n \n   Lizzy: It got taken away in an instant.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, in a blink of an eye.\n"

            "interview_part": "This audio has two parts of the interview: 1)   \n   Lizzy: What do you miss the most about the States?\n \n \n   Laila: I would say my family, mostly. Probably the opportunities that you\n   would get there. In Mexico, it's really hard to get an opportunity. A lot\n   of people are where they are because they know someone [Laughs] or because\n   they've paid to be there and it's really hard trying to be what they would\n   say, the working class. Trying to work your way to a point where you know\n   you're successful and you can say, \"I've done a lot of things.\" But if\n   you're not the cousin of the owner, or if you're not a family member\n   related to somebody in power, it's like you don't have a chance.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You need those connections.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you feel like you don't have those connections because of the\n   time that your family spent in the States?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah I do. I do. I could say I do have a couple of family members,\n   but I don't feel comfortable, or the need to go and ask for a handout. My\n   mom was never like that, she would always be like, \"Work for your own\n   things and do it for yourself.\" It's really hard. I do have a couple of\n   family members that do that, and are like, \"Well put me here.\" Or, \" I want\n   to be in this position because I'm your cousin. I'm related to you in some\n   sort of way.\" But we're not like that. I don't know if we were raised\n   differently or we saw different things in the States that it\u2019s not really\n   plausible to do that in the States. [Chuckles] There may be a couple of\n   cases where that has happened but there's a lot of more open opportunities\n   in the States so it would be probably that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Is there anything you don't miss about the States or something that\n   was hard about living there?\n \n \n   Laila: The fear. The constant fear, that actually came true [Chuckles], of\n   your family members being deported or coming home from school because since\n   I was underage, I kind of knew that I was safe from that because they\n   weren't going to raid schools, like middle schools and stuff like that. But\n   it was a constant fear of coming home and being told that, I don't know,\n   your dad's not coming back or your mom's not coming back. And it did happen\n   like that. Unfortunately, my father was working and he was raided. So he\n   got taken away and then when I came back home one day from school, my mom\n   told me. It was really hard.\n    2)   \n   Lizzy: What was the hardest part about coming back to Mexico?\n \n \n   Laila: I would say leaving my siblings and leaving my home practically. I\n   considered the States being my home, completely. Coming to a place where\n   [Chuckles] the third week that we came to live here, there was a car shot\n   down, completely, and two people killed like right outside my house. That\n   was really scary [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Did you see it happen or hear it happen?\n \n \n   Laila: I heard the gunshots, and when I looked out of my window I just saw\n   two motorcycles leaving at a high speed. When a lot of the neighbors went\n   to the car to see what happened and to see if they could help anybody,\n   there was two kids dead there. They were probably between fifteen to\n   seventeen-years-old. They were pretty young and they were shot down\n   completely there.\n \n \n   Lizzy: This was soon after you got back?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So they were about your age?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, they were about my age and it was really scary seeing that,\n   when in the States you mostly don't see the violence first-hand. You may\n   hear about it and all that, but where I live it's constantly. A couple of\n   months ago, somebody also got killed like a block away from my house. You\n   just hear the gunshots and you just completely freeze. It's really hard.\n \n \n   Lizzy: How much of the time would you say that you're in fear? Like every\n   day? Every week?\n \n \n   Laila: Every day, every day. Especially now with a lot of women getting\n   targeted in where I live\u2014around I live, there are a lot of missing people\n   posters you could say, and they're all from ten to fifteen-years-old.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow.\n \n \n   Laila: And they're all little girls. It's really hard, and it's scary being\n   a woman here in Mexico, it's really scary. My mom always says if you're\n   going to go out, be back before the sun is down. If you need help, I don't\n   know, get a taxi or get help or I don't know, just run, she says. Don't\n   freeze because the worst thing you could do is freeze. I don't know, it's\n   really scary when your parents have to tell you that before you go out and\n   have them constantly calling you like, \"Are you okay? Is everything okay?\"\n   It's really hard. It's really hard.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So it's a very different kind of fear than what you had in the\n   States? Something about how in the States you had to be in fear of the\n   police or ICE.\n \n \n   Laila: [Affirmative sound]\n \n \n   Lizzy: And now here, it's fear of violence. Which one is worse?\n \n \n   Laila: I would say, the fear that I have here because probably with ICE,\n   you know that you're going to be detained and deported. Here, you don't\n   know if you're going to go back home. You don't know if you're even going\n   to make it back home. In the news, constantly, there are women being found\n   dead, beaten, shot. Even when you go into the public transportation,\n   constant fear of having someone get in and shoot a gun. It's constant where\n   I live. Public transportation is probably the worst thing you could go on\n   because it's constant. The people getting on there to rob other people\u2014they\n   just shoot without even thinking twice. They shoot you and they don't care.\n \n \n   Laila: So, it's probably a lot scarier here [Chuckles] than in the States.\n   In the States, you know you may get detained, you may get deported and\n   that's that. But here you're just scared for your life, completely.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I can't imagine. It just sounds terrifying.\n \n \n   Laila: It is. It is.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Is there anything positive about being back in Mexico?\n \n \n   Laila: It would probably have to be getting to know family members that you\n   probably never thought of meeting, or people that, I don't know, they knew\n   you when you were a baby and you don't even remember them. So it's probably\n   the having a lot more family, because in the States it was just me, my mom,\n   and my two brothers and that's it. We didn't have aunts, we didn't have\n   uncles, we didn't have cousins, we didn't have our grandmother. We didn't\n   have anybody and here it\u2019s like, you have your grandma, you have your\n   uncles, they all get together and they have parties and get togethers,\n   cookouts or whatever. It's probably being able to meet more family members.\n   That would be the only positive thing [Chuckles] that I would personally\n   see being here back in Mexico.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Lizzy: Do you think the government of Mexico should be doing more to help\n   return migrants?\n \n \n   Laila: I do. I do think that they should help them. I mean, even with the\n   simplest things like housing or provide shelters while they get on their\n   feet, while they're able to find something where they can work and have a\n   decent income. A lot of people here work for, like me, at my first job, I\n   was paid thirteen pesos an hour. So I worked for six hours every day for\n   thirteen pesos an hour. Now looking at it, it was like, why did you even\n   approach that job? It's completely not, it's dumb. But a lot of people,\n   even with my English, even with my knowledge, I worked for that income for\n   about a year. So probably the hardest part if we hadn't come back and had\n   somewhere to stay, would have been housing, somewhere to stay. I don't\n   know, probably an easier way to find a job, a decent job to get back on\n   your feet and be able to do something better for yourself because you're in\n   your home country. It should be easier for you, but it's not. It's really\n   not. Sometimes it's even more difficult when you come back from the States\n   because you're used to a certain type of living and when you get here it's\n   completely a 180. So, I think the government should be looking a lot more\n   to help its own, and to help the returning migrants because we do know it\n   is a current conflict with the States where they don't care. They just\n   don't care. They're like, \u201cyou're not from here, we don't have an\n   obligation with you so just go home.\u201d And when they go back to Mexico,\n   Mexico is like, \u201cWell why did you leave?\u201d\n \n \n   Laila: It's like being pushed away from both sides. So, it's really hard.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Like neither side wants you?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah. It's being rejected from the States and from your home country\n   because even if you do have a high school degree here, they don't think\n   it's valid unless you go and have the institution here in Mexico validate\n   those studies. If you don't do that, it's like your paper's not worth\n   anything. So, it is on both sides. Getting rejected from the States and\n   getting rejected from your own country where you should have it a little\n   bit easier to find a job, to find housing, to find, I don't know, even a\n   decent meal. So, it should have the Mexico government thinking a lot more\n   on our own returning migrants. I knew a couple of people that worked here\n"

            "interview_part": "So, in the US,\n   do you think, or what do you think the government could be doing\n   differently to support families like yours?\n \n \n   Laila: Honestly, just make it easier for somebody that is willing to work\n   and willing to provide for a better future. Just give them an easier way to\n   be there legally so they don't have to live with fear. A lot of people are\n   like, \u201cOh it's you guys don't pay taxes, you guys don't do this, you guys\n   don't do that.\u201d And it's like, well if you guys gave us a chance, we would\n   definitely do all of that. And it would be a lot better for a lot of\n   people, I guess, to be there legally and be able to work. Be able to do\n   everything the right way. So I would honestly just think of the government,\n   thinking up better ways for immigrant families to be able to apply for\n   citizenship. A lot of the families that I knew and that were there, they\n   never did anything wrong. They were never, they'd never had a record,\n   specifically for the fear of getting deported, they did everything by the\n   law. And a lot people that have a residency or that were born in the\n   States\u2014I used to think this way\u2014they didn't really take advantage of the\n   things that they had. A lot of the students that were in my high school,\n   they would strive and they would fight for scholarships. They would fight\n   to get into schools and all of that. And a lot of people that are born in\n   the States, they just take it for granted, and they're just like, \u201cOh it's\n   there, it's whatever.\u201d And for a lot of immigrant kids it\u2019s like, \u201cNo,\n   that's everything to us. It's everything to us specifically, because we\n   know what it's like to have absolutely nothing.\u201d For us, it is a lot. It is\n   very difficult for us to understand. Why would you not take advantage of\n   that?\n \n \n   Lizzy: [Affirmative sound]\n \n \n   Laila: I don't know, it's just two different mentalities I guess, because\n   of where we come from and because of how a lot of us are raised. When\n   things are handed to us, we just take them for granted. So, in my point of\n   view, if the US government would want us immigrants to do things correctly\n   and go by their law, they should make it easier for us to do it, to do so.\n   We're not saying we're against paying taxes or against doing this, or\n   against doing that. Like, no. It would, a lot of families would be more\n   than happy to go by the law, but it is just very difficult to get\n   citizenship or something to be able to stay there legally and work.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Nearly impossible for a lot of people.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah it is.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you think that makes immigrants harder workers?\n \n \n   Laila: A lot of them. I do, I do believe that. A lot of them go to the\n   States looking for a better future for them and their kids, to give their\n   kids something that they couldn't have. My parents, they didn't even finish\n   middle school. And to see my brother walk across the stage with his high\n   school diploma in hand, and being able to visit ASU [Arizona State\n   University], because he got into ASU.\n"

It may\n   be a little bit easier now because I'm a lot older and I kind of understand\n   a couple of more things, but it does feel like I don't belong in Mexico.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you consider yourself Mexican or American or both?\n \n \n   Laila: Mostly, I would say both. I would say both even though I don't have\n   a paper to verify that I'm from the States. I know the language, I know the\n   history, I know a lot of more things from the States than I do for my own\n   country.

Seventy percent from the\n   States and a thirty percent from Mexico [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Because that's where most of your life was.\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, most of it. Probably, I didn't think that I would come back\n   and live back here in Mexico, but I guess I'm going to be staying a lot\n   longer here. It may change at a certain point, but I still do feel like I\n   am more a part of the States than I am from here.\n"

We went to Piedras Negras and then we found a person that was going\n   to cross us. That person, maybe he didn't know the exactly... road. We were\n   at the dessert at 4:00 AM. We take some gallons of water. We didn't have\n   like any other stuff, like water and food to eat. We start walking at 4:00\n   AM. And then, well I didn't know what time it was it, but we stopped eating\n   at the middle of the desert. We were eating tacos. Well my little sister\n   was, she was little. She was like three years old, and she was walking with\n   us. She was crying because she couldn't do it anymore. She wanted to\u2026 My\n   dad pulled her out. Just helped her out, he pulled her on his back, and he\n   continued walking with us. I was trying to be strong, because of my sister\n   who was little. And then, we saw the la migra, the police, immigration. We\n   go back, then we stay like lay down on the middle at the dessert.\n \n \n   Laura: Then it got dark, and then it had started to rain. We were\n   walking\u2014we didn't know where we are. We were walking, and we have some...\n   Well it was like a little mountain, I don't know how to say that, but it\n   was like a little fold. We were walking, like in a little line. And we went\n   with our cousins. One of my cousin was going to fall down. Then we got to\n   the line, we were walking. It was raining, it was dark. The only light that\n   we can see was the moonlight. We didn't have any light at all. We were\n   walking, then when we got to the... We saw the road, but I don't know where\n   we, exactly. We just lay down. That rain was getting to us. My little\n   sister was shaking, because she was cold. We didn't have any jackets. My\n   dad was very scared because my sister didn't answer, my sister fell asleep.\n   And she was shaking a lot, but she never answer. We tried to wake her up,\n   and she never answer. We're like, \"Oh, my God, what happened to her?\" But\n   then she wake up, and she said she was fine, that she was cold only.\n \n \n   Laura: We were with many other people. Then we stay there, we fall asleep,\n   then somebody wakes us up and tell us to run to a truck. We run to a truck,\n   and there was two people that were driving, and he sit me on the back. He\n   lay my sister down and my dad was outside on the back of the truck. Well,\n   they drive all to, I think it was Arizona. Then we get to one home, they\n   just remove us the shoes. We didn't have any shoes on. We went to a little\n   room, and there was many other people that were already crossed there. The\n   only thing that we have, it was like a little bit, they gave us food to\n   eat. We have it. So, we stayed there for like twenty days because they\n   didn't know\u2014I mean, they didn't tell my other relatives, my family, how\n   much was going to be. So, we didn't have the money to take this, so we say\n   like twenty days there and there was people that have arms. We were\n   sleeping and there was somebody taking care of us, so we don't escape or, I\n   don't know, but they have arms, like huge arms.\n \n \n   Anne: Guns?\n \n \n   Laura: Guns. I mean, I was very afraid because of my sister. She was a\n   little girl. My dad was afraid as well. He just wanted to take us out of\n   there, but we have to wait like the twenty days. When we go to the bathroom\n   when we need, my dad took us to the bathroom. To eat, they only give us one\n   egg, and just a little piece of bread in the whole day. It was pretty much\n   the worst. And then, when my family takes us out, that person that would\n   take us out to another person, that person sit me in the front of the car.\n   And that person has a gun right beside me. I was pretty scared about it,\n   because I thought they were going to kill us or something. Once they took\n   us to the other person\u2014the other person was pretty nice\u2014he took us to his\n   house. He told us to take shower, to grab the food that we want. So, that\n   person was very nice with us. He give us food, we took a shower, and then\n   he took us to California where we supposed to be."

Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,\n   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and\n   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky.

You\n   are always out of the box. In Mexico, people is really closed-minded. Like,\n   they believe that if you were born poor, you will stay poor.

And at the end of\n   the day, a lot of companies just don't care and they want cheap labor. And\n   a lot of people just want to pay less.

And then\n   I did the research myself and I realized that I wasn't going to be able to\n   apply to a real, a four-year college or something like that. And\n   thankfully I met a guy from, a Puerto Rican guy, from this community\n   college and he told me, \"You know what, you can do your general ed and then\n   you can decide on studying something.\u201d He just approached me, and he was really\n   nice. So I went to the community college with hopes of doing general ed and\n   some art classes and maybe find a way to transfer to CalArts [California\n   Institute of the Arts] and try to study animation or something like that.\n \n \n   Anne: Okay.\n \n \n   Luis: And I did that. And the first obstacle was that since I wasn't really\n   a resident, or even a citizen or whatever, the fee, the tuition for, per\n   credit was triple. So it was, I had to work a lot just to pay for mediocre\n   education.\n \n \n   Anne: They've changed that now, in California.\n \n \n   Luis: They have, that's what I heard. I was like, [annoyed sound]. It's\n   okay though. I mean, because my little brother actually graduated and he's\n   like a mechanic or something. And he has DACA [Deferred Action for\n   Childhood Arrivals], so.\n \n \n   Anne: Okay.\n \n \n   Luis: But the funny thing is that with all of those things, his life hasn't\n   really improved that much. I was still going to school, paying triple, it\u2019s\n   okay, I don't mind\u2014well I do mind, but I have no choice. So yeah, I'm doing\n   that and I'm working a lot. And then after a year I realized that, what am\n   I supposed to do? Am I really going to get into CalArts? I don't have a\n   social, I don't have an ID, I don't even have a bank account. I don't have\n   nothing. What am I supposed to do? And it was kind of hard because I had to\n   give that dream away.\n \n \n   Anne: You lost hope?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah, a little bit. But I mean that was really\u2014fuck, this is the\n   first time happening [Clearly emotional].\n \n \n   Anne: Sorry.\n \n \n   Luis: Anyway.\n \n \n   Anne: Sorry.\n \n \n   Luis: So I always like to dance. Right? So I thought, okay, maybe if a\n   formal education is not from me, I can do something more attainable, that\n   requires no money and I can still be somebody. So, I decided to start\n   breakdancing a lot [Choking up]. A lot of hip-hop dancing.\n \n \n   Anne: Oh, yeah.\n \n \n   Luis: And a lot of breakdancing. I will focus on breakdancing because I saw\n   these incredible athletes on TV. And I was like, \u201cOh, this is what I do for\n   fun. I can really focus on that thing and maybe become a pro. Maybe even\n   get papers.\u201d But it didn't work out, because competitions were all over the\n   country and I couldn't move.\n \n \n   Anne: You couldn't get on a plane, right?\n \n \n   Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, \"You know\n   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting\n   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.\u201d"

I knew I was undocumented probably my\n   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things\n   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family\n   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.\n   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good\n   stories from him. [Laughs]\n \n \n   Luisa: He was a prisoner of war. [Pause] Her mother asked me\u2014and I mean\n   this girl would spend every single day at my home, or I would spend every\n   single day at her home or her grandparents\u2019 home. If my mom couldn't find\n   me, she'd call L___\u2019s mom and if L___'s mom couldn't find me, she'd call my\n   mom, and that's how it was. Her sister would call me like, \"Hey. Could you\n   tell L___ that she needs to come on this day because we're going to have\n   the family barbecue? You're invited, too, obviously.\" All family events I\n   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.\n   We were best friends.\n \n \n   Luisa: Her mother, I remember one time she's driving me home, and she asks\n   extremely aggressively if I am illegal or not. And I remember being scared\n   like a deer in the headlights. \u201cNo, I'm not. I'm not.\u201d I was so scared of\n   this mostly because one of my uncles saw somebody\u2014an ex-girlfriend, I think\n   it was, pretty much accused him of being illegal. He was deported and we\n   had this huge thing in our heads that if somebody knew we were illegal, we\n   were going to be deported and ripped away from everything that we knew. So\n   I was not allowed to tell anyone.\n \n \n   Luisa: To this day, none of my friends know that I had no papers. None of\n   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed\n   to tell this? This is a secret and\u2014\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.\n   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty\n   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I\n   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science\n   Facility\u2014research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in\u2014I'm not\n   sure what kind of testing they're doing there\u2014[Chuckles] but they ask you\n   if you're an American citizen or not.\n \n \n   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, \"I am\n   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American.\" She was put\n   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in\n   there and that was very \u2026 that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm\n   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody\n   ever knew.\n \n \n   Anita: Last time, you told me a lot about how being undocumented affected\n   your life. Can you talk about that too?\n \n \n   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire\n   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that\n   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to\n   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't\n   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You\n   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you\n   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd\n   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled\n   over? My mom\u2014she\u2019s an amazing driver\u2014but what if she got pulled over? What\n   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing\n   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the\n   shadows. Nobody really knows.\n \n \n   Anita: You used a metaphor --\n \n \n   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in\n   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're\n   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in\n   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but\n   you don\u2019t know what it\u2019s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being\n   in a golden cage.\n"

I've always had the grades for\n   it, but they were asking \u2026 I don't remember what kind of document they were\n   asking for that scared me into not applying, and I was like, \"You know\n   what?

I don't\n   remember her name, but she was redheaded with glasses. She fucking hated\n   me, man, because I'd laugh at pretty much all her work. I'd finish it in\n   seconds and she'd get so frustrated with me because she's like, \"Ugh. What\n   am I supposed to do with you?\"\n \n \n   Luisa: I wanted to be challenged and I did my research. Whitney Young is\n   supposed to be for people who are gifted and I wanted to be challenged. I\n   wanted something more. Everything has always been extremely easy for me.\n   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.\n   I think the problem with human beings is that you\u2019re your only true enemy.\n   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you\n   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,\n   sniffles].\n \n \n   Luisa: That's what I wanted.

I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because\n   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't\n   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get\n   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].\n   Still not a challenge.

There were about 140 people that turned it in. It was one\n   of the top twenty projects and I did that in three days, so it was still\n   not a challenge.

I'm going to be the\n   best student wherever I am.\" So I started swimming, track, volleyball,\n   softball, everything, extracurriculars like crazy, book club. Whatever it\n   was, I needed it. The environmental club, everything. I started doing a\n   bunch of community work\u2014I always liked community work anyway. Shelters, dog\n   shelters, everything. I did everything. My entire day schedule was full,\n   full, full, full, full, full, full. Every single day was like let's go, go,\n   go, go, go because I'm going to get to the best university I can.\n \n \n   Luisa: I wanted Northwestern. I had my eye set on Northwestern. I don't\n   know what it was about Northwestern that called to me, but I wanted\n   Northwestern. That's what I wanted, and it wasn't unachievable. One of my\n   friends got into Brown University and she had worse grades than I did, so I\n   was like, \"Northwestern's going to be easy. I got this.\" I wanted to be an\n   oncologist\u2014yes, an oncologist, cancer. I don't know why [Chuckles]. I don't\n   know. Human tragedy, I wanted to save people. That's been my thing. I want\n   to save people. I want to make people better. So [Pause] I killed myself in\n   school. 4.6 GPA. I had all these extracurriculars.\n \n \n   Luisa: I was set to go into a good future. That's what it was, but when it\n   came down to it, my mom was like, \"No. You know what? You can't. You don't\n   have papers. You can't continue your education here. We cannot afford to\n   pay your entire tuition. We cannot afford to pay for your housing or your\n   books. Each book, that's like $5000 for books. We can't do that. I'm\n   sorry.\"\n \n \n   Anita: Did you qualify for DACA?\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes, and that's when it had come out. Right when I had graduated\n   high school was when DACA came out, and my mom said no. She made me feel\n   extremely selfish for wanting it. She let me know that, \"You know what?\n   Yes, you're going to get what you want, but you're going to affect all of\n   us.\" But in my mom's mind and I think in every single Mexican or\n   undocumented person's mind is that distrust of the government. That they're\n   going to have you in this database and they're going to know exactly where\n   you live and who lives with you and where you are. I don't want that, and\n   she did not allow that. I know. I know. I could've, but I didn't.\n"

I didn't have a specific place.\n \n \n   Anita: You didn't only read fantasy?\n \n \n   Luisa: No, I read historical fiction as well. I had an obsession with the\n   Yellow Fever and the Bubonic Plague. I had an obsession with the original\n   Los Cantos [Los Cantos de Maldoror], The Iliad, The Odyssey, Dante's\n   Inferno. I was fascinated with Dante's Inferno, and then I got into\n   Boticelli, the man who actually portrayed Dante's Inferno. So yes, I was a\n   huge reader [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Luisa: I was fascinated by human tragedy\u2014extremely fascinated by human\n   tragedy. There came a point where all I read was about the Holocaust,\n   children's tales, Anne Frank's tales, and The Book Thief. I have a signed\n   copy of The Book Thief because it is one of my favorite books ever. Have\n   you read The Book Thief? [Exclamation] Great. I haven't seen the movie.\n   Don't ever want to watch it [Chuckles], but the book \u2026 I don't know.\n   [Pause] I don't know why I'm so fascinated by human tragedy [Pained\n   Laughter]. And the Black Plague, huge thing. I got really into the Black\n   Plague. That was about in the 1400s where Mr. Shakespeare was around and\n   when Mr. Niccol\u00f2 Machiavelli was around, as well. Yes, I was into history,\n   historical fiction. I was into everything.\n \n \n   Anita: You read philosophy, as well?\n \n \n   Luisa: Yes. I've read Freud, Nietzsche. Crime and Punishment was a huge\n   one. That one changed me a lot. There's this thought of, \u201care you above the\n   law? Is anybody above the law?\u201d Yes, I was big on reading.

I mean, [chuckles] it really forces you to\n   think about existentialism, essentially [chuckles]. About your life, the\n   meaning of life, what am I going to do. It's a new world, I'm a new person.\n   You become a new person. You reinvent yourself. Coming here, it's an\n   extremely philosophical experience. And you're experiencing two different\n   cultures. And you're learning how to adapt to those cultures. So it is\n   philosophical, it is. You know, you're thinking about very important\n   existential issues. It's an existential crisis essentially [chuckles]. So,\n   it's urgently philosophical. In an urgent manner. You know and it forces\n   you to think, it forces you to write. Some people don't do that, some\n   people might get into trouble. I find that people that get deported from\n   the States tend to avoid that criminal lifestyle that they had in the\n   States and they come here to become better. That's what I've seen.

It's a radical change,\n   first of all. In terms of culture. And it's a matter of survival. So, this\n   is the worst thing that could happen to you, right, as an American. To be\n   taken away from your country, so it's a very traumatic experience. You come\n   here and it's a necessity to survive and to become successful. And you also\n   see the conditions here, which are different.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: The jail system is not the same. It's like a concentration camp, so\n   you don't want to go to jail here. In the States, you could kind of afford\n   to go to jail, it's a five-star service hotel, resort, and spa [chuckles].\n   Right, they cook you your food, they clean your clothes, you can study, you\n   can become somebody there. Malcolm X, coming out of jail became Malcolm X.\n   Right [chuckles]? It's a nice place. Compared to Mexican jails [chuckles].\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: Mexican jails, it's like a concentration camp. So, you have that in\n   your mind, you don't want to go to jail here. You see the conditions,\n   you're not, as an American, you come here, you're not dumb. You see the\n   conditions here are different. And then when you have a job like that, like\n   a call center, in an office, makes you feel good. Right, because in the\n   States you probably didn't have that opportunity to work in front of a\n   computer with air conditioning and being able to wear a suit and feel\n   important. So, you have that job and so you see all this, and you got to\n   take care of it. And then you get a nice girlfriend, that takes care of you\n   and it's nice. Very traditional. And you see the opportunities here and you\n   tell yourself, \"Well, if I continue in this path, on this good path, then I\n   can become somebody here. I can redeem myself\". And people do redeem\n   themselves and become better and probably live better than in the States.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anita: Many people talk about how discriminated they are against here.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: Yes, it does happen.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anita: But you're saying that there\u2019s a positive experience, which is many\n   deportees -- is also kind of dignifying.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: It is dignifying. Absolutely. Absolutely dignifying. You have\n   tattoos, maybe taxis won't stop here for you because you look like a\n   criminal\u2014you're going to get discriminated\u2014and then you get a good job like\n   that -- that people here with university titles have. So, you're working\n   right next to a sociologist, with tattoos. So, Smokey, from East LA\n   [chuckles], that was gang banging, he could barely finish high school is\n   sitting next to somebody that burned their eyebrows to get a position like\n   that, so you feel good. You feel dignifying, you feel like you have value.\n   And you walk differently, and you talk differently. And you feel good about\n   yourself.\n"

Instead of the Virgencita de Guadalupe and all that,\n   the real God is survival. That's what they worship here.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: And you need to be smart, you can't afford to be dumb here, at all.\n   You have to be smart here, you have to get knowledge, get education.\n   Because you're going to be left behind, everything's very fast moving. I\n   even got that concept, that movement is essential for our society.\n   Everything's movement. Without movement, you know, there is no growth,\n   there is no development. So that's what I'm analyzing right now. Just the\n   concept of movement. It's really stimulating here [chuckles]. It has pros\n   and cons, right? But It's really stimulating. If you're a writer, if you're\n   a philosopher, if you're an artist, it's really stimulating to live here.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Miguel: My childhood, my whole idiosyncrasy. My whole world view is shaped\n   by the American perspective. That's why I see myself acting differently\n   than most folks here. I have a different perspective of life.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anita: How do you see yourself acting?\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: [Chuckles] I guess I demand my rights. You know, I don't know, I\n   don't have my head down [chuckles]. I'm confident. I walk with confidence\n   in the world. I'm sure by myself and I demand my rights. My girlfriend, she\n   doesn't want me to do that because she feels embarrassed sometimes. For\n   example, just a common example, if we're walking behind somebody in their\n   space or they're just blocking the whole thing, and there's space on the\n   other side, I just say, \"Excuse me, excuse me.\u201d And my girlfriend gets mad\n   because here according to this culture, you have to wait. People are afraid\n   to say excuse me. Stuff like that. And I guess just the freedom of\n   thinking. Freedom of developing my own world view, not following an\n   ideology that's been traditional for many years. I shape my own world view,\n   that's what I learned in the States. That rugged individualism [chuckle].\n   Which could be bad and good. I think it's mostly good to have rugged\n   individualism.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: That's why I love to listen to jazz. Jazz is the greatest\n   description of the US and of that attitude. Of keeping it cool and that\n   rugged individualism, improvisation. I listen to jazz sometimes when I'm on\n   the metro. And then another metro passes by and you're listening to jazz\n   and then you see the night, the lights, the cars moving by. It's very\n   inspirational [chuckles].\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anita: You think jazz is a form of rugged individualism?\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: Absolutely, I think jazz is about rugged individualism. It's about\n   a guy with his instrument, just making it up as he goes. Just making it up\n   as he goes. And it's democratic, if you think about it, cause everybody\n   gets to speak in jazz, even the bass player. If you listen to jazz,\n   everybody speaks. The bass player\u2014it's not only the brass. Some people just\n   listen to the brass, but everybody has a story to tell. Everybody listens.\n   Everybody has something to say. Everybody has a solo. I think that's the\n   only art form that has a solo, and it's rugged individualism. It's the\n   American initiative. That's what America is to me. That rugged\n   individualism. That sometimes we don't have here in Mexico. It's very\n   collective. Even though we say it's individualistic, it's not, it's very\n   collective.\n \n <br/>\n \n   Anita: Is collective good?\n \n <br/>\n \n   Miguel: Collective is good. I love collective. You go to a family gathering\n   and you eat pozole [chuckles]. You're breaking a pinata. They're inviting\n   you to a lot of things. I've been to Itzapalapa, I've been to Tepito. I've\n   been to all kinds of places, celebrated, very, very collective. People\n   helping each other out when the earthquake happens. People are very\n   collective. Which is good. I try to balance both. I try to balance the\n   individualism of America and now in this new stage of my life, the\n   collectivism. To be more collective. Trying to balance it out, maybe\n   something can happen. A good balance can always bring a good result, I\n   think. So, I don't know. I'm learning from the collectivism. I think it's\n   good. It's not always good to be individualistic, right? There's another\n   pluralism of the US. I'm still pluralistic, I'm trying to change that a\n   little bit.\n"

So my mom ran away and took us to Los\n   Angeles to live with my uncle. And, at that time, my dad didn't know where\n   we were, because my mom was really scared.\n \n \n   Mike: She took us to Los Angeles to live with my uncle, and I remember we\n   moved back to Arizona, because we thought my dad wasn't there anymore.\n   Well, we were staying in this little spot called Conway, Arizona\u2014like two,\n   three months. And at that time my dad found us\u2014because one of my family\n   members told him where we were\u2014and he tied my mom up, went in there with\n   another guy, masks on and kidnapped us.\n \n \n   Mike: He took us to Texas for two years. We were actually on the news as\n   missing children. If you look me up, I have all our photos. We were gone\n   for two years, and the reason that they found us was because my dad was\n   actually trying to rob a wheel store\u2014rim store. He broke in and the police\n   got him, and they took him to jail, but they had no idea who he was or he\n   was being looked for.\n \n \n   Mike: And it took a whole month for the cops to come to my house. So I was\n   with my two little brothers and my little sister was born by that time. She\n   was like three, four. We stayed a whole month with nobody just by ourselves\n   in the house. And I remember this\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: How old were you?\n \n \n   Mike: I was 11, 12.\n \n \n   Anne: And you were the oldest?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. And that's that right there... I could see why single mothers\n   and people that just don't have any help, why they stress, or why they go\n   through all that stuff, or why they treat their kids bad and stuff, because\n   it\u2019s hard taking care of kids. I remember not having anything. On the last\n   day of the month, I opened the freezer, and there's nothing in there.\n   Nothing at all. And I'm like, \"What am I going to do? What am I going to\n   feed my little brothers and sisters?\" And then I was just like, \"You know\n   what? I'm just going to go to the store and just steal something. A bag of\n   chips, whatever.\" So I go in the store and the guy was really nice. He was\n   an Arab guy. He was always telling me, \"Hey, just pay me back tomorrow.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And I had remembered he had already done that. He gave me a bag of\n   chips, and he just told me, \"Pay me back whenever you come.\" So I was like,\n   \"Dude, I can't do that again, because I don't have no money this time\"\n   [Emotional]. So I remember I prayed to God. I prayed to God. I was like,\n   \"Please God help me. I don't want to steal from this man. He's really good\n   guy.\" And, oh dude, this is crazy, because I look in my pocket\u2014I had the\n   chips in my hand and I was acting like I had money. Sure enough, I reached\n   in my pocket, and I had a dollar. A freaking dollar. I was like, \"God I\n   know you're real.\" Because at that time I was like, \"Yeah.\" But I got home,\n   opened the little bag, put some lime, put some hot sauce, feed my little\n   brothers and sisters.\n \n \n   Mike: Then I'm telling you, we were so hungry that I had some seeds, some\n   plants\u2014the garden seeds and stuff. I went outside thinking that they were\n   going to grow in a couple of days. I made myself a little garden, I was\n   planting them, and I was like, \"Please, God...\" When I was praying, I was\n   like, \"Please God, let me get this food so I can feed my brothers and\n   sisters, because I don't know when my dad is going to come.\u201d And right when\n   I look up, I see two officers. A lady and then a man. They said they were\n   US Marshalls or something like that. They took us.\n \n \n   Mike: We stayed with them for a couple of days, and then they flew us back\n   to Arizona where my mom was staying at. So yeah, those two years being away\n   from her, my dad had lied to us and said that she didn't want us anymore\n   because she had another kid on the way. And yeah, my dad didn't care. He\n   just lied to us and said that my mom didn't want us.\n \n \n   Mike: So, I was thinking like, \"Why do you want us back? You say you didn't\n   want us.\u201d Little did I know all that. She told me all this stuff that\n   happened and I just started busting down and crying. And I was always mean\n   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she\n   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom\u2014got my mom butt naked and\n   put her in the closet\u2014and left her there and then took us to Texas\u2026 I used\n"

Out of the ten years of the kitchen, seven\n   years they were only for Japanese food. I know Italian, Chinese, Korean,\n   but Japanese is the one that captured my attention. All the rolls and\n   everything, the flavors. I know here, their palette, the Mexican people,\n   their taste, they are not really like aware of flavors. I'm working on it.\n \n \n   Lizzy: You can teach them how to like it.\n \n \n   Noe: Yeah, one example, when I first got into my village, I make a shrimp\n   fried rice with fruit spring rolls. They only ate the spring rolls. They\n   didn't like the fried rice with the shrimp. They\u2019re like, \u201cThis is the best\n   thing that you gave me?\u201d There is a big pot, maybe three pounds, three\n   pounds of rice.

Okay, fuck it! Just leave it, I'll just eat it all by myself.\u201d Yeah,\n   they didn't like it. Some of my friends, they like it, but my family, my\n   parents, they're like super Mexican. [Chuckles]. They don't really used to\n   a different type. They give you beans, tortillas, and pork meat, and beef\n   meat. They're happy with it.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Well, hopefully one day, if you have a Japanese restaurant, they'll\n   come eat there and learn all about the food.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Noe: My profession was to be a chef, so I was trying to look for chef jobs\n   around here. I've found a few of them, but I was just harassed. I don't\n   know. In my department, on the hotel I was working as a chef, I was the\n   only bilingual, not even the servers. The waiters, servers, hosts, they\n   didn't know how to speak English. Sometimes, I was trying to be nice with\n   them and trying to help them out, translate, because there's a lot of white\n   people coming in there. It's like 80% of the customers, they're\n   white\u2014that's the only people with money. Sometimes I notice that they are\n   having trouble trying to understand the customer, and I was just trying to\n   be nice [Chuckle], and trying to help them out, translate what they want or\n   what their allergies and everything. Instead of thanking me for doing that\n   for them, they was just complaining about me.\n \n \n   Lizzy: They got mad at you?\n \n \n   Noe: Yeah, they got mad at me. And I was like, \u201cWell okay now guys, eff\n   you, I'm not helping you anymore.\u201d I only stayed there for three months. I\n   can't do this, because everyone was just complaining about me. Well, I\n   guess I was just trying to be nice, but they don't see it that way.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Why do you think you had trouble getting along with them when you\n   tried to help them with English? Do you think that they were embarrassed?\n \n \n   Noe: They might be embarrassed or they might feel like I was trying to make\n   them less or something. That was not my intention. I was trying to help. I\n   was not being rude. I was not just like using rude words like, \u201cHey, you\n   have to say like this, not say like that,\u201d or something like that, trying\n   to yell at people. No. It's the opposite because I was always telling them,\n   \u201cIf you need help with any words, any pronunciation, just let me know. I'm\n   here for you guys to help you out.\u201d They didn't take it like that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: They didn't want help?\n \n \n   Noe: Yeah, and one other thing that I was not getting along with them is\n   because they were, like with the company, they always eating the product,\n   stealing this and stealing that. I was like, \u201cI'm not like that, guys, for\n   real. We don't have to. We have a cafeteria. There's cake, there's a lot of\n   food in there, and it's free. You guys can eat everything from there. I\n   don't see the reason why you guys have to eat the product or eat the\n   things. Sometimes we short for the customers because you guys eating it.\n   I'm not taking that.\u201d Also, there's quite a few situations that I went\n   through that the customer forgot their cell phones on the table, on the\n   bar, on the sushi bar, what everything. They just look each other, trying\n   to think what to do. You don\u2019t have to deal with it, you have to return to\n   the customer! The customer's still at the door. It\u2019s like, \u201cWhat are you\n   guys thinking about?\u201d\n \n \n   Lizzy: Sounds like you had a different work ethic than your coworkers\n   there. Why do you think that is?\n \n \n   Noe: I don't know. Maybe because I was raised differently with the U.S.\n   culture, I guess? In the U.S., you can leave your cellphone anywhere, and\n   even if you lost it, there's a high probability that they will return it. I\n   got returned my wallet twice with money in there, and they didn't really\n   ask for rewards and everything. I remember one time, a lady\u2014a messy girl\n   from the streets, I think she was homeless\u2014she showed up at the restaurant,\n   and was like, \u201cHey, is this yours?\u201d It was my wallet. I was like, \u201cYeah.\n   Where you found it?\u201d \u201cHere. There's a lot of money in there, so take care\n   of it.\u201d I didn't even know I lost my wallet, and they returned it. I was\n   like, \u201cHey girl, just sit down and give you the menu. Ask whatever you\n   want.\u201d\n \n \n   Lizzy: That's amazing.\n \n \n   Noe: She was like, \u201cOh no no, I got to go. I got to go.\u201d I was like, \u201cYou\n   sure? Come on, let me cook something for you. You can have it for later.\n   You can have it for to go. \u201cNo no, no, thank you, thank you, thank you.\u201d\n   She just left. I was like, \u201cWow.\u201d"

I\n   remember that they were already starting with the girl gangs, and all that\n   stuff, and fighting. I didn't like it because I was like, \"Hey, why fight?\n   We can play. We can do something else.\u201d [Chuckles]. But, no, they liked to\n   fight. So they will be fighting and if you wanted to be their friends, you\n   had to do it. I remember one. The first fight I went to, I was standing in\n   the back. [Chuckles]. So they started fighting, and I was like, \"I'm just\n   going to leave.\" Then the police came, so everybody started running. I was\n   like, \"Why are you running?\" [Chuckles]. I would just sit down, and I was\n   just like, \"Okay. Well, I'm not doing anything. I'm just sitting down\n   here.\" They came. Then they asked me, \"What was going on?\" I was like,\n   \"They started fighting. I was sitting.\" Since they saw I wasn't scratch or\n   anything, they were like, \"Okay. Just go home.\" I remember that fight\n   because they ripped out an earring. There was a lot of blood. Then somebody\n   bite somebody's eyebrow, and I was like, \"What?\"\n \n \n   Anita: Bit somebody?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. I was like, \"What? What are you doing?\" So it was really\n   scary for me, and I didn't like it, but you have to do it because you want\n   friends. If you don't do it, they're going to do it to you. That's when my\n   aunt came in, and she's like, \"Come with.\" She saved that part of me.\n \n \n   Anita: So, did you find another group of friends?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Well, yeah, when I went to live with my aunt, it was a whole\n   different story because I used to live in ___ California. It's a really\n   Hispanic town.\n \n \n   Anita: Okay.\n \n \n   Olimpya: We used to live there. Then my aunt used to live in ___,\n   California. It's a really nice little town and really American. So, when I\n   got there, I was like, \"Hey, I like it here.\" [Chuckles]. When I got to\n   school, also the kids were different, there weren't gangs, and I was able\n   to choose my friends. My aunt always used to make fun of me because I used\n   to have all types of friends, Americans, Mexicans, Korean, Japanese,\n   everything. You would see me with my friends, and you would like\n   [Chuckles]. Because you see, normally, they separate the Mexicans from\n   everybody else. I would speak with everybody. I wouldn't care.\n \n \n   Olimpya: My aunt would be like, \"Why don't you go with the Mexicans or just\n   one group?\" I was like, \"No, I can learn from everybody. You can learn from\n   everything.\" I like how African Americans talk, and how they act, and how\n   happy they are. Then you also turn around and look at Americans, and you\n   see how nice and educated they are. They talk about music. They talk about\n   really cool things. Then you go with my Korean friends, and they teach me\n   how to draw. You can learn from their cultures and the way they were raised\n   just by talking to them. That's amazing for me. That's why I used to like.\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Olimpya: So I was happy. Then my aunt would be like, \"Okay. If you can\n   speak Korean and understand it, it's your problem.\" [Laughing].\n \n \n   Anita: Did you learn Korean?\n \n \n   Olimpya: No, I couldn't.\n \n \n   Anita: Oh.\n \n \n   Olimpya: I really tried. I tried really hard, but since I was really trying\n   to learn English because first, so I was like, \"Okay, it's hard.\" [Laughs].\n   But I kind of understand because my friends didn't speak English really\n   well, so we were like, \"Uh.\" We make hand signs so it was fun.

But one day, my uncle, who's an American citizen, came to Mexico\n   for a vacation. It was in the meantime when we were out of the house. So my\n   mom saw him. They talked about what was going on, how he can help, and one\n   day, my mom said, \"You know what? We're leaving.\" So we grabbed a couple of\n   clothes, shoes, and we left.\n \n \n   Anita: Just like that?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. One day to another, we were already on the road. [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. We were on the mobile home with my uncle and his family. We\n   were setting off to Ciudad Ju\u00e1rez.

I was really happy about that, but\n   then you look back, and you're like, \u201cMy dad, my sisters, my house, my\n   toys, my things, what's going to happen?\" I was happy during the day\n   because I wouldn't think about it, but at nights, I used to have really bad\n   dreams about it, about leaving my dad, about everything.\n \n \n   Anita: So, it was just you who went with your mom?\n \n \n   Olimpya: No. My two brothers and I.\n \n \n   Anita: So, somebody stayed behind though? You say your sisters?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. Well, I got two more sisters and two more brothers. They're\n   older. But they're not my mom's. They're my dad's, but we grew up together,\n   so we're really...\n \n \n   Anita: I understand. I understand. So it was really hard to leave all of\n   this behind.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yes. But as a kid, you don't think about it. You just, in your\n   mind, you have it there. You know it's there. I know because, for a whole\n   year, I used to have really bad dreams where I used to wake up crying. My\n   mom would be like, \"What's going on?\" I'm like, \"My dad, my dad, my dad.\"\n   She's like, \"But it's already a year.\" I was like, \"I don't know. It just\n   comes out.\"\n \n \n   Anita: Do you remember some of the nightmares?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah, I remember one that it's like really stuck in my mind. It's\n   really weird. The day we left the house\u2014it's the same house where my dad\n   lives right now, so it's on the avenue. I remember my mom, she had a truck,\n   I don't know who give it to her, to take out our stuff. I remember I was\n   sitting on the back looking like this and seeing my dad. Then I start\n   crying. That's a dream I can't forget about. I don't know why, but it's\n   there. [Chuckles]. It's just there.\n"

But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.\n   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that\n   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's\n   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I\n   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all\n   girls here, they're not the same. They think, \"No, you're a girl, you need\n   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.\" Then the daughter-in-law comes,\n   and then she's like, \"No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for\n   my son.\" So it's education basically, ignorance.\n \n \n   Anita: So, do you think differently?

Do you think differently because you grew up\n   in the States?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah, but I have both cultures. My way of thinking is really weird\n   because I am very domestic. I love to cook. I love to take care of my son.\n   I love to take care of my husband. I love to take care of my house. But if\n   I need to go work because my husband needs help or anything happens, I'll\n   do it. I don't mind. I can work. I know how to do this. I know I'm really\n   smart, and I know I'm capable of doing. I know I can do things on my own,\n   but if there's no need to, I can stay out. [Chuckles]. That's what I want,\n   not because they're forcing me too.\n \n \n   Anita: But you also talk about raising your son differently.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah. Yeah. My son is in first grade, so he is about the age when\n   I left. Last week, he came to me. He's like, \"Hey, mom. I need to tell you\n   something, but you're going to get really mad.\" I was like, \"Okay. Tell\n   me.\" I thought he did something bad. He's like, \"I'm in love.\" [Laughing].\n   So, I was just like, \"Hold on. I was expecting something else.\" So he's\n   like, \"I'm in love.\" I'm like, \"Okay. That's not bad. I'm not going to get\n   mad at it.\" \"Wait, mom. It gets worse.\u201d I'm like, \"Okay.\" \"She's in third\n   grade.\" [Chuckles]. So, I was like, \"Okay. She's old for him,\" but inside\n   of me, I thought about it, right? I was like, \"Okay. I'm not going to tell\n   him \u2018No, you can't, because you're too small, because she's a girl. She's\n   too big.\u2019 No.\" I was like, \"Okay. That's fine. She's a girl. You're a boy.\n   What's the problem?\" He's like, \"Are you sure?\" I'm like, \"Yeah. You like\n   her. Be nice to her. Buy her a chocolate, a rose. Be nice. Respect her.\"\n   So, he looked at me and he's like, \"Can I write a letter for her?\" I was\n   like, \"Go ahead.\" So instead of teaching him to not respect girls since\n   he's that small, it's like turning it around. Respect her. If you like her,\n   respect her. That's it.\n"

It has been since day one. I remember I used to live in\n   California. You know California has the best sun ever. [Laughs]. I used to\n   live in the pool. After school, pool. I remember I got really dark. When I\n   came back, it was around summertime, so I was really dark. I got here, I\n   got out of the airplane, I saw my dad and my two sisters. When they saw me,\n   the first thing they said was, \"Hey, you're dark.\" I was like, \"Yeah.\n   Hello. [Laughing]. What's the problem?\" They're like, \"No, we need to buy\n   some creams to lighten your skin and we need to...\" I was like, \"Hey, I\n   like my skin. I'm bronzed. I'm from California. What are you talking about?\n   I'm brown. I'm Mexican. What are you expecting? [Laughing].\" So, it kind of\n   hurt. At the beginning, when they said it, I start joking about it, but\n   inside of me, I knew it hurt because nobody in the United States, nobody\n   said something about my skin color before\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: Wow.\n \n \n   Olimpya: ... or about anything about myself. Nothing. If I was short, they\n   would be like, \"Hey, you're really cute. You're really short.\" They would\n   compliment the way I am. And here, it was the opposite. They would be like,\n   \"Hey, you're really short. Hey, you're brown. Hey, you're... I don't know.\n   I don't like you.\" They would be like that, and it was starting from my\n   family, so it hurt. I was like, \"How come in a country where I'm not like\n   them, they wouldn't say nothing about me? And here, they're attacking me?\"\n   You know? So that was the first hit. I didn't want to come at all. I was\n   like, \"Hey, mom. You go back and you let my aunt and uncle... They'll adopt\n   me. They'll give me the papers, and I'll go visit you.\" That was the\n   easiest way for me, but she said, \"No, you got to come back with me because\n   if you don't come with me, they're not going to accept me back in Mexico.\"\n   Like my dad, at the house.\n \n \n   Anita: Oh, but didn't your dad have another family?\n \n \n   Olimpya: It's really weird. [Chuckles]. I was like, \"Hey, but I don't want\n   to go back with you.\" So she made me come back. Once I get here, I see my\n   family. They do that to me, and I was like, \"Ugh.\" So I started getting mad\n   inside. I didn't like anything. When I got home, I was like, \"Hey, this\n   thing is really small,\" because, in the States, house are really big. And\n   here in Mexico, they're really small apartments. I was, \"Hey, where am I\n   going to live? I need my space.\" So I started being really rude. I started\n   being a bad girl.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Then they said, \"Okay. You need to study. You're going back to\n   school.\" I was like, \"Okay. At least, I get to have more friends, right?\"\n   Once I go to school, they signed me up, I was like, \"Mom, you're not going\n   to leave me here. They're going to do something to me. They're going to\n   kill me. They can kill me or violate me. This is not a school.\" It was a\n   really, really, really bad school. If you look at a jail in a school, that\n   was my school. [Chuckles]. They didn't have windows like this. I don't\n   know. It was bad. The principal, for some reason, she said that I came to\n   Mexico as an exchange to study. So they thought I was an American girl like\n   tall, blond, blue-eyed girl, and that wasn't me. [Chuckles]. Once they\n   present me at school like that, and once they saw me, they were like, \"You\n   don't come from the States.\" Like, \"Well, I do. I wasn't born there, but I\n   do come from the States. I basically come from there.\" Like, \"No, you\n   don't. You're just a Oaxaque\u00f1a.\" Start calling me names again, \"You're\n   brown. You're short. You're skinny.\"\n \n \n   Olimpya: I don't need to be like another person to come from the States.\n   You need to understand that. Thousands of people go to States to have a\n   better life, and then they need to come back. Why are you being so rude if\n   they don't treat us like that? If I'm at my home country, why you being so\n   rude? They start calling me really bad nicknames. They'll start stealing my\n   stuff, my backpack, my books, everything. I would go to the bathroom, come\n   back, and I wouldn't find my notebooks. I was like, \"Okay. Just give it\n   back.\" Then since they noticed I wouldn't respond to that, they would start\n   getting aggressive, getting in front of me, calling me names, saying bad\n   words and stuff. I would just turn around and leave. Since I wouldn't\n   respond to that, they would start getting physical. They would pass by and\n   push me or punch me or do something. Once I got mad because I was sitting\n   down studying, they came and pulled my chair from the back. I fell off, and\n   this girl started punching me. So I was like, \"Hey, I need to protect\n   myself now.\" So I did, and I got expelled because of that.\n"

That was what being happy was: like, having your family, the family\n   that you love there for you, and you being there for them. Everything that\n   we went through, it was awesome. I can say we were poor because my mom, she\n   was a single mom with three kids, she had three jobs. We barely see her,\n   but the times that we were sitting down at the table eating together, it\n   was the best times of our lives or a Sunday, we could go swimming. It was\n   just great.

It was really hard for her.\n \n \n   Anita: So, who raised you?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Well, my grandpa and my grandma. We didn't live with them, but\n   they lived next door. So they would check on us. My aunt and uncle, I lived\n   for a really long time with them. Basically, they used to help each other a\n   lot. If my mom wasn't home, they would check on us and if they weren't\n   home, my mom would check on them. They would help a lot.\n \n \n   Anita: How was school?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Great. The best. [Chuckles]. I used to love school there because I\n   remember you\u2014in the morning until 3:00 in the afternoon, something like\n   that\u2014will actually learn. I was really bad at math. I know that. [Laughs].\n   But I remember in middle school, there was a teacher that will give\n   afterschool classes for the ones that needed help. So I would stay. You\n   would see me the whole week there, an hour, two hours, studying, studying,\n   studying, but I will actually learn. I went from an F, [Chuckle] because I\n   was really bad, to a B+ in one month because I was actually learning. I\n   used to play the violin. I used to play basketball. I used to love all\n   those activities that you got in school. I was happy in school. If I would\n   live there, I was happy.\n \n \n   Anita: You were an American kid.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Yeah, I was happy because I would get to do everything I wanted\n   to. If I wanted to play football, I would play football. If I wanted to do\n   this, track days, everything, I could do it because it was there for me.\n   [Chuckles]. I used to like it. I would just get home, eat, finish my\n   homework, and then go to another activity. So I was always busy, always\n   busy, always busy. I don't know. That would keep my mind going. Here, you\n"

Because I know people are scared of\n   the police because we are undocumented and everything, but every time I saw\n   a police, I was like, \"Hey, thank you.

I want\n   to be them. Just want to look like that. I want to do that.\" That was my\n   biggest dream.\n \n \n   Anita: But you were undocumented. How did that feel?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Being undocumented? I didn't think about it. I never thought about\n   it. I was just living my life, being happy. [Chuckles]. I don't know if I\n   was too small and I didn't see more than my little world, that it was going\n   to be hard for me to join the army or it was going to be hard to me going\n   to college, I was just live in the moment. I never thought\u2014nobody asked me\n   about my papers, none of my friends, family, nobody. I was just there being\n   me in America. [Laughs].\n"

So, my first, my initial\n   experience in Mexico was bad, it was bad.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: I was lied to, I was deceived, I was stolen from. It's like every\n   little turn it was always a smack in the head or something. But little by\n   little I started getting acclimated to everything that was going on. How I\n   should go about moving in certain areas or how I should talk, how I should\n   move. Better yet, how to adapt to certain situations.\n"

And I\n   asked them, \u201cWell here, give me a second, let me read it.\u201d And there was\n   another person, right? Because it was a desk like this one. It was four\n   seats this way with the divider being the computer, the fingerprint scanner\n   and a camera, like a little Nikon camera, simple camera.

I waive my right to any\n   formal hearing. Basically, deport me as soon as possible.\u201d And I'm like,\n   \u201cSo you're telling me that without explaining to me what's going on or what\n   this form entails, you're just going to have me sign it?\u201d\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Because they told me, \u201cWe're not going to let you speak to your\n   family and you're not going to see your family for a long time if you don't\n   sign this because you're breaking some law or whatever.\u201d Because they even\n   showed me little papers saying, if you state that you're a US citizen it's\n   a federal crime punishable by between\u2014I think it was like\u2014three to seven\n   years in federal prison.\n \n \n   Rodolfo: Now, I'm not sure if that was another one of their little tactics\n   or whatever, but nonetheless didn't let it scare me, I didn't let it affect\n   me. I'm like, \u201cOkay cool, that's great man, I'm not going to sign this. I\n   need to go in front of a proper hearing and a judge. I want to bond set.\n   Because I know, well, I may not know my rights a hundred percent, but I\n   know that I'm, I'm entitled to a bond or at least a hearing for a bond.\u201d\n"

I get off from work, and I would have to drive around 45\n   minutes. I got stopped by the stop sign, for the light, for the back-up\n   light. It was a sheriff, and he just asked for the driver's license. I have\n   only the permit license. So, he asked me for if I was a resident, if I\n   could show any proof. I was honest with him. \"No, I'm not.\" So, he right\n   away called Border Patrol.\n \n \n   Anita: Really?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Anita: What year is this?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: That was I think 2002?

No, from there I got deported.\n   They called Border Patrol. From Border Patrol, they told me that they will\n   let me go, but I will have to go to court because I already had a daughter,\n   and I was married, and I had a baby coming. So, from there, I went to court\n   and everything. But when I went to court, they deported me. So, they gave\n   me some time to come back to Mexico. So that's been, already, 11 years.\n   They gave me papers, so I have to come back over here. I came back with my\n   daughter, because my son, he was only three months.\n \n \n   Anita: What about your wife?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: She stayed over there. But we already made the papers, so we could\n   fix the residence. But from then, I came over here, and this is a sad\n   story. I came over here with my daughter, and she was with my son over\n   there. She came over here, but she was pregnant from somebody else.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. So, from there, she came over here, we tried to fix things.\n   It didn't work out. I mean, it worked out for a little bit. She went back\n   to have the baby, and she took my daughter, and she left me my son. So, she\n   left, and she had the baby, and from there, she didn't fix my papers\n   anymore. I stayed with my son right here. Right now, I'm a single dad.\n \n \n   Anita: You're a single dad.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. My son is from over there, he's already 11 years.\n \n \n   Anita: He's living with you? He's an American.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: He's an American. He's living with me. He lives right here; he\n   goes to school right here. He's going to turn 12 years old next month. I\n   can't take him back because he doesn't know his mom, and he doesn't want to\n   know nothing about his mom. He wants to go back with my aunts, but it's\n   kind of hard. He doesn't want to let me go. I want him to go over there,\n   but he doesn't want to go without me, and I'm not going back without my\n   papers. Illegally, I'm not going back.\n"

In Minnesota, that's when I started working in a fiberglass\n   company. We used to make snowmobiles, all of that kind of parts.  2)     When that happens, I got to know a\n   lot of American people. We used to get along. I will say that they were my\n   best friends.\n \n \n   Anita: Americans?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. At that point, yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Did you go to Mexican restaurants? What did you do with them? How\n   did you hang out with these people?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Pretty much, they were from work. On the weekends, we didn't work\n   on Saturday and Sunday. So sometimes they would show up at the house, and\n   we will cook out. Even sometimes the weather wouldn't let us, we would\n   cookout in the garage. That's something that we would do.\n \n \n   Anita: What did you cook?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Everything. I mean, even they tried carnitas, carne asada.\n   [grilled meat] I don\u2019t know if you know tripa [intestine]\n \n \n   Anita: Yes. They tried tripa?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. One of my best friends, he loves guacamole. It was something\n   new for them at that time because it was like nobody knew that guacamole\n   was avocado. It was something new for them. He would love that. He would\n   always be like, \"I brought some chips, you make the guacamole.\" He will\n   show up at the house, and we will make it. He would get along with my\n   aunts, with my uncles. He was like a part of the family.\n \n \n   Anita: What food did he cook for you? Did they cook for you too?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No.\n \n \n   Anita: They just wanted Mexican food.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah. His food was pizza, that was all. Pizzas and hamburgers.\n   Sometimes we would be like, \"Let's go out to eat.\" \"Yeah, let's go.\" He\n   would go, \"No, I want some pizza. I want some hamburgers.\" I would be like,\n   \"Let's go to my house, let's see what thing we can make.\" One thing he\n   would love, it was tinga. I don't know if you know\u2014\n \n \n   Anita: Yes, I know what tinga is. My favorite tacos.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yeah.

He knows he's American, but he looks Mexican. If you will tell him,\n   \"Yes, I am from the United States, but I'm from Mexico, too.\" He will be\n   like, \"Mexico, Mexico.\" This is funny, because sometimes, when we had the\n   soccer games, Mexico versus United States, we will be at home, and be like,\n   \"A quien le vas?\" [who are you rooting for?] He will go, \"Mexico.\" That's\n   funny, because that's something that we would play with him because we\n   would tell him, \"But you're not Mexican.

Even over there, I mean ...\n \n \n   Anita: But I'm wondering, because your son came here so little, whether he\n   might be more Mexican than you are in some ways.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Even though he's the American, and you're the Mexican?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: I know. That's something that I will tell him. My son doesn't\n   speak English. Some people will say to me, \"Why you don't teach him?\" I\n   mean, I teach him some words. He knows, like I tell him, \"Do your bed.\" He\n   knows what I'm telling him. But he doesn\u2019t know how to pronounce it. Why?\n   Because at school, they only speak Spanish. They don't have an English\n   class. He doesn't have nobody to talk English but me. I'm the only person.\n \n \n   Anita: In his way of thinking, is he more Mexican in some ways than you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. Yes, even the way that he talks sometimes.\n \n \n   Anita: The way that he talks, you said? Like what?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: We call right here, we talk like Chilango, they have some\n   different words. I'm from here, but I don't even talk that way. He talks\n   that way. I'm like, \"Mijo, why you talk that way?\" I don't mind it, because\n   he's a good boy. I'm not going to complain about him. Sometimes it's hard\n   for me, because it's only me and him. Before, when he was a kid, I think he\n   needed more of his mom. But now, we're getting there.\n \n \n   Anita: How old was he when he came here?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: One year.\n \n \n   Anita: One year old. Wow. So, he's an American citizen?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes.\n \n \n   Anita: Who came here because you were deported, and although he's an\n   American citizen, he's growing up in Mexico \u2014 I mean, he's a Mexican\n   12-year-old.\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Yes. I mean, he pretty much, even on Independence Day\u2014that's\n   another thing that we celebrate here too. Him and me, on fourth of July, we\n   celebrate. We do something. Everybody is like, \"Why you do this?\" There is\n   something that people don't know. It's like Thanksgiving, too. People don't\n   know why we celebrate that. But we celebrate it, because for me, because I\n   used to do that, and I want him to keep doing it.\n \n \n   Anita: So why is July 4th important to you?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: Well, we used to get all together, like family, and fireworks, and\n   it was the long weekend, so we would go swimming, we would go to the river.\n   In Minnesota, it was the river. In California, it was to the ocean, to the\n   sea, to the bay.\n \n \n   Anita: Do you do hotdogs and stuff on July 4th?\n \n \n   Rodrigo: No. Well, always, always, on Thanksgiving it was the turkey. On\n   the side, they would make some Mexican food. Same thing on the Fourth of\n   July. We would make some Mexican food.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Ruben: No. Actually, if you're going to come over here and do the same\n   thing you were doing over there, I think you would be wrong. A lot of\n   people say, \"Oh, they deported me. That's messed up. And the new\n   president...\" It's not that. Look if you basically see it in a good way.\n   All right, let me see what I can do. Okay, if I can become a manager here,\n   I can get paid good. I can have my car, I could probably buy an apartment\n   and I can live free. But other people don't see it like that. They come\n   over here, and they want to start fighting with people, or try to\n   intimidate the people from the area, and I don't think that's good.\n \n \n   Ruben: Instead of intimidating them, show them what you can do. \"Oh, my\n   bathroom is messed up. It's leaking.\", \"Hey, I can fix it.\", stuff like\n   that. I worked with my dad a lot of times. Trust me, I could do that upside\n   down. But a lot of these guys don't see it that way, and you've got to put\n   it in them. I try to tell them, \"I'm going to give you a little bit of\n   line, it's to you if you can get it. Because people here, they judge you by\n   how you look, not by what you want, and that's what you've got to change.\n \n \n   Anita: How do you change that if you look the way you look?\n \n \n   Ruben: I did. People around here, if we walk around, you'll see people\n   saying \"Hi\" to me. \"Hey, hi Ruben\" How have you been? You all right?\" They\n   offer me food. I don't know if I look like I haven't eaten, but they'll be\n   like, \"Hey, are you hungry?\" And they've got little taquitos puesto or\n   tortas, and they see you, and they already know that if they've seen you, I\n   used to go in and sweep their little spot. They will be like, \"No, no\".\n   Look, I'll be like, if you sell food, your place has to be clean, because\n   if I walk by and you have all kinds of trash and you're selling burritos,\n   I'd be like \"Nah, I would rather get that hot dog from the 7-11\", but if\n   you have it clean, people will be like, \"Oh it's a clean spot. Let me sit\n   down right here and eat. Let's see how good it is.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: And that's how I started getting these people to know me or like me,\n   because they would say, \"Why don't you guys go back to where you're from?\"\n   and I'll look back and say \"I'm from Mexico. I just didn't grow up here.\" I\n   show them that I'm a different person, not what they thought I was at\n   first, because they will see me and they will move to the side so I can\n   walk by, and I would ask ladies, \"Why do you move? If I'm giving you the\n   way for you to walk, out of respect, why do you move to the side? I'm not\n   going to take your stuff.\" On the other hand, I will probably even help you\n   out if anything is happening to you. So that's what these people are\n   seeing, and with me, they're nice people and they have looked for many ways\n   to help me out.\n \n \n   Ruben: Not money-wise, but they will be like, \"Look, if you help me do\n   this, I'll pay you for it. I know you know how to do it.\" They used to get\n   other people to fix their stuff, and now they call me. They will be like,\n   \"Hey Ruben, I got this problem. Can you come and see it?\" \"Yeah, I'll be\n   there right now.\" That's what we have to do, not get them more against us.\n   Show them that we care for them, too. If we're going to be here, it's the\n   same community we're going to defend. People robbing, people stealing,\n   doing bad stuff, we get along with them, we get really involved with the\n   environment right now with the same people.\n \n \n   Anita: How hard is it to convince others to follow your path?\n \n \n   Ruben: It's hard. It's hard. Depends on what kind of ideas they have when\n   they got here. A lot of these guys think, \"Oh, I'm a gang member. If I just\n   walk up to them and look at them all crazy, they're going to give me\n   something.\" and that's not the way to do it. I'd rather be like, \"Hey man,\n   you got 5 pesos I can borrow? I'll give them to you later on.\" People will\n   be like \"Nah, I don't think you'll give them to me.\" I work right here.\n   They start to get to know you, they start giving you a little bit of trust.\n   Like the guy in the bathroom, he leaves me right there sitting down,\n   charging people, sitting there watching TV, while he goes and does\n   something else. He comes back, and I have never seen him counting his\n   money.\n \n \n   Ruben: I didn't even know he had a camera, but he was like, \"I seen you on\n   the camera, and I don't see you grabbing anything else but grabbing your\n   stuff.\" And he goes, \"I never seen you taking money. I never see you not\n   even eating the chocolate without asking me. So why should I ask you how\n   much did you make?\" No, he just comes and be like, \"Hey, thanks man. Are\n   you hungry? Do you need anything?\" He'll give you money, and on the side\n   he'll buy you something to eat. Me, I will say, \"No man, you don't have to\n   give me nothing. I'm not asking you for nothing. I'm not asking you to pay\n   me. All I'm asking is just to get to know me. You think I'm cool or the\n   nice person that you don't think I was, well that's all I want to earn.\"\n   These people's respect, you know? So he can see me like them. No quiero que\n   me vean diferente (I don\u2019t want to be seen differently), you know?\n \n \n   Anita: Do people, others who don't think like that though, the ones who\n   think they can come here and just act tough. How do you get through to\n   them? How do you persuade them that there's another way?\n \n \n   Ruben: Why should I have to show them the difference? I have taken walks\n   with them and these are the guys that tell me, \"I know everybody here. I\n   know what I'm doing. Nothing's going to happen to me.\" I walk with them and\n   they see when everybody's like, \"Hey, how have you been? Where have you\n   been? Would you like to come in? Stay here for a minute. Are you Working?\n   Can I help you out in getting you some job?\" And they just look at me and\n   be like, \"Why are they interested on helping you?\" And that's when I tell\n   them \"That's different between me and you. They're not looking to help you,\n   because you walk around like you're going to take their wallet. I don't. I\n   might have the face, but I smile. Good morning. Good afternoon.\" If they\n   want to answer, Hey, it's more than appreciated. If not, I mean that's\n   them. People are different.\n \n \n   And they see it and some people will be like, \"Ah, yeah, you're nice.\" And\n   I say \"No, it's not because I'm nice. Show them who you are, who you really\n   are, not who you were in the neighborhood. The neighborhood is done, gone,\n   past.\"\n"

That's a big park\n   where you can actually have a picnic, play volleyball.\n \n \n   Anita: Santa Fe down? Like down?\n \n \n   Ruben: Like down. And that was our thing to do every year. Every 4th of\n   July we all get together, bring firecrackers, and do the little things that\n   we like to do. We tried to keep it like that as long as we could, we never\n   let a neighborhood get in between it. Even though they did try it, we never\n   let it get in between. Even them, they had brothers who were like, the\n   younger was from this neighborhood, and the older was from another\n   neighborhood, so they had to respect it. When the peace treaty came around,\n   it was a tough time because we were going through a tough time. We had\n   what's called the green light, where anybody could just come and shoot at\n   your neighborhood. Anybody. It doesn't matter who it was, and we had that\n   for 13 years. It came off in 2004, so it was rough. But the ones that we\n   survived, there's only five of us out of 15.\n \n \n   Anita: Only five of you out of 15 survived?\n \n \n   Ruben: It's kind of sad, but the ones that we made it, we look back and\n   say, \"Damn. We should've made a meeting about changing our life, not\n   talking about what we do.\" Things that a lot of people don't know. That's\n   the anger that some people do have. I don't have no anger, I've just got\n   memories. Those are the things that a lot of people don't know how to\n   handle.\n"

Wherever he went, I went.\n   Wherever I went, he went. They arrested us for, supposedly, a strong armed\n   robbery, which we never did. Since I had already been in juvenile hall, I\n   ended up taking the blame so he can come out because his mom kept crying.\n   \"Oh, my son, I don't want him to go to jail.\" I took the blame for both of\n   us, and he comes out a month after he actually gets killed in front of his\n   house.\n \n \n   Anita: By?\n \n \n   Ruben: By a drive by, a rival gang. Everything changed for me right there.\n   It actually went insane for a minute. I thought everybody was against me\n   and I didn't really trust anybody until after. He was just a really cool\n   friend. Abraham, Abraham Rodriguez.\n \n \n   Anita: Were you in jail at this time?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah, I was in jail at the time when he got killed. So it was hard,\n   but you have to get through it. Some things, you have to be strong in front\n   of people. When you're alone, maybe bring out that little sadness in you.\n   Me and him were inseparable. Even his mom would say, \"You guys are\n   brothers, but from different mothers.\"\n \n \n   Anita: How old were you when this happened?\n \n \n   Ruben: I was 15, 15 and a half.\n \n \n   Anita: Just a kid?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah. We were actually just kids. The crazy thing is that when he\n   got shot, he got shot, and he stayed alive until his mom got there. He\n   actually got to say his goodbyes, but he maintained himself alive until she\n   got there. I didn't get to see him. When I came out, I just went to go see\n   him at the cemetery, but it's sad to lose somebody close.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Anita: You were part of a gang. Why do you think kids like you end up in\n   gangs?\n \n \n   Ruben: There's three things that I have noticed why we get involved. Well\n   the first one will be we're Latin, we're Mexican. So, cops don't pick\n   people. Cops, they actually just go directly to you, and they start poking\n   you and poking you saying, \"What are you doing? What do you have in your\n   pockets? Take everything out of your pockets, put your hands on your head.\"\n   For somebody that is not involved in a gang, or at least with kids that are\n   doing something bad, it's something that gives you anger. Not hate towards\n   the cops, because they are actually doing their job, but why you picked me\n   when you just saw the other guy going by and he looks more dangerous than I\n   do?\n \n \n   So, Mexican kids get poked on by the cops. So, you start growing some type\n   of anger like, \"Why me? Okay, you want to see me like that?\" Because with\n   me, all it took it was six months. When I got to Whittier, California,\n   there was an officer there. His last name was Fuentes. He was Mexican. I\n   don't know if he wanted to show off for his coworkers or the rest of the\n   cops, but he will always, always stop me. Even if I was with my mom, he\n   would get me off the car and search me. I don't think that was legal. But\n   at the same time, I wasn't legal.\n \n \n   Anita: How old were you?\n \n \n   Ruben: I was 11 and 12 when he kept harassing me, harassing me, harassing\n   me. When he saw that I became a gang member, I mean, he saw a whole\n   different person. When I was 14, he came to me and he apologized. He said,\n   \"I should've never picked on you. I think I made you the person you are\n   now.\" I said, \"Look, everybody has a choice and I made one.\" I said, \"I\n   became a rebel. Now, you're going to see what you wanted to see. Just some\n   advice. The next kids, just don't do that. Instead of picking them up,\n   taking them to a Boys &amp; Girls Club or taking them to the police\n   station, show them what you guys do. What's important, what's bad. That's\n   what you guys should do, not poking us and searching us and taking off our\n   shoes.\"\n \n \n   It's embarrassing for people or neighbors to see you. Even when cops come\n   to your door and knock and say, \"What do you have in your pockets?\" I will\n   say, \"Excuse me? I mean, I'm in my house.\" He will say, \"I know. You're\n   just a person I like to mess with.\"\n \n \n   Anita: You said there were three things. So one is the cops picking on you.\n \n \n   Ruben: One is the cops. The second, it could be the environment you grew up\n   with. For example, when I was in LA around 59th Street, that's where I\n   picked up the little things that I knew when I was already 14, which was\n   when I went to juvenile hall. The third thing-\n \n \n   Anita: What do you mean you picked up? The neighborhood? Explain a little\n   more.\n \n \n   Ruben: Well, I mean, look in LA in 83rd St. from Vermont in 59th all the\n   way to 96th St., there was problems in between African American kids and\n   Mexican kids. They didn't like us because we were not American. So all of\n   that, it actually starts making us say, \"Hey, I can fight. I can hit you,\n   just seeing what you do.\" So, you start growing some type of anger towards\n   the streets and reveal another person. Right away, you actually snap and\n   start doing things you're not used to. You start losing fear. Some people,\n   well actually, I had a friend, he stabbed another kid, and they were both\n   14. I didn't have the guts to do that. Well when I saw that, I said, \"Man,\n   it looks easy. That guy that bugs me might need that.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: So, those are the ideas that you start getting. The other kids, or\n   other little gang members, see that, so that's going to pull you towards\n   them, \"Hey, come here. This is where you belong. We are your family.\" I\n   always said, \"It's dumb to say I got in the neighborhood because my family,\n   they didn't love me.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: I mean, I'm going to tell you one thing. My mom used to hit me with\n   the cable from, I don't know if you remember the old radios, with those\n   cables because she didn't want me on the streets. When I grew up, I told\n   her, \"Every hit that you gave me, it actually made me a little bit stronger\n   on the streets.\" So when somebody will hit me, it wouldn't even hurt. So,\n   you start growing that anger, that anger, that anger, and you get an\n   attitude. That's when, and you actually join a gang. When they see that you\n   are already ready for that.\n \n \n   Anita: Is that the third thing?\n \n \n   Ruben: Third? Yeah, the third thing, it will be parents. Parents push you\n   to do that.\n \n \n   Anita: How do they do it?\n \n \n   Ruben: There's parents, or well at least Mexican parents, they're real\n   strict. My grandfather was really strict. My mom was really strict, but\n   they didn't push me to be a gang member. My friends, their families would\n   kick them out when they were 13. So, what do we do as their friends? \"Hey,\n   come here, man. You can come and sleep in my house,\" and that will be a\n   group of gang members.\n \n \n   Anita: Why do they kick them out?\n \n \n   Ruben: Mexican parents are tough. They actually, if you don't want to learn\n   the good way, \"All right, go to the streets and learn the hard way.\" They\n   might care for you, they might love you, but some of them are tough. Too\n   tough. My mom was tough, but she never kicked me out. She actually, when I\n   left the house, she went out there with a piece of broom looking for me.\n \n \n   Anita: Piece of broom?\n \n \n   Ruben: Yeah. She was like, \"You better go home,\" but she wouldn't hit me.\n   She will hit my friends. She would tell them that I wasn't their friend and\n   that I didn't want to be a gang member, \"Stay away from him.\" My friends\n   were laughing, saying, \"Man, your mom is crazy. Why did she come and hit\n   us?\" I said, \"I don't know.\"\n \n \n   Anita: So if you were asked, \"How can we prevent this from happening so\n   that Mexican kids or Central American kids don't join gangs?\" What would\n   you say?\n \n \n   Ruben: Well, there's different things. I mean, look, before I joined a\n   gang, I was a great soccer player. I used to play for the city. There were\n   actually providers with some type of income, and since we were the good\n   students, and we had good grades-\n \n \n   Ruben: ... we actually qualified for that. I used to play for the city and\n   the soccer team, and I was doing good until the streets started calling me.\n   Actually, we feel like the streets call us.\n \n \n   Anita: So, you're saying that if there are other things to do?\n \n \n   Ruben: There's other things to do. Look, I used to stay busy. I used to go\n   to Boys &amp; Girls Club right after school, stay there until 7, go home,\n   do my homework, shower, and sleep. When my membership from Boys &amp; Girls\n   Clubs ended, my parents didn't have the income to do it. That's when I was\n   like, \"So, now what do I do? Let me go to that park and play with those\n   guys.\"\n \n \n   Ruben: Not knowing that they were already affiliated with gangs, and that's\n   how everything starts involving it, \"Oh, all right. Oh, no. I don't want to\n   do that. Here, man, it's okay. All right, just a little bit.\"\n"

I didn't want to, but I guess I couldn't for some reason,\n   or I did go out and hang out with them. I did do a lot of things that they\n   did, but I never considered myself part of it. I thought I was just\n   affiliated. I thought it was normal because everybody was doing it. Not\n   only in my city but in other cities. I saw the TV, so I thought it was just\n   something normal that teenagers went through and eventually they get back\n   on track. I thought it was just part of being a teenager. I didn't really\n   think I was, \"Oh, I want to be the biggest gang member in the world.\" I\n   just thought, \"Oh, yeah, it's cool.\" I did want to be part of something,\n   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that\n   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I lived in Arkansas, so I remember a lot of people from California started\n   coming in. A lot of people from Chicago started coming in. So, There was\n   like a lot of activities going on. I just thought it was part of just being\n   a normal teenager because including my, I don't want to discriminate, but\n   my white friends, they were going through other things as well, so I was\n   like, \"Oh, it's just this normal thing.\" My black friends, they were doing\n   similar things, so I didn't think it was only Mexicans. I thought it was\n   just in general.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   What were your white friends and black friends doing that was the\n   equivalent?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Well, graffiti. We used to love writing on the walls. Or, I don't know,\n   smoking marijuana. Things like that. Not like damaging or killing people,\n   nothing like that. But more like the lighter stuff. Especially my white\n   friends, they were the ones that really had the marijuana. We didn't know\n   where to get that. My black friends, well they were more into the hip hop\n   and graffiti culture. So, I thought that was pretty cool, and I would go in\n   the library and started just searching books about it. I said, \"Okay, it's\n   normal.\" There were like what you call crews, depending on which area that\n   you lived. For example, this is the Centro so all the little kids from the\n   Centro would hang out and they would go compete with the people from uptown\n   and things like that. I guess that was just it.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Then eventually it got more into music. Instead of fighting each other we\n   would like rap and insult each other but in a more clever way. At the end\n   of the day, \"Okay, you did good. I like what you said about them,\" or \"I\n   like what you said about this.\" It's just part of the culture for me to\n   grow like that.\n"

Well, I'm just\n   illegal.\" They were like, \"Oh, don't worry. You're going to get out. You're\n   not as bad as we are.\" I was like, \"I hope not.\" It was whites, blacks,\n   from other nations, Mexican, Hispanic people. It was everybody mixed. I do\n   remember people just being with each other. White people being with them,\n   and black people being with them. I said, \"Why? Why can't we all just be\n   together? It was like that at school, why can't it be here?\" But I guess I\n   started learning that racism exists, and you have to either defend yourself\n   or defend your people.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I remember even defending a person from the Marshall Islands because a\n   Mexican guy had taken his food. I said, \"Hey, man, don't take his food.\n   That's all he got to eat.\" They were like, \"So, what, are you going to\n   defend them now?\" I'm like, \"I'm just defending a person. He's just like\n   us. We're all detained. We shouldn't be like that.\" But they got onto me\n   and they said, \"Either you're with us or against us. If you're against us,\n   we're more.\" I said, \"Okay, I guess I can be with you guys,\" just for being\n   scared. Then after that I was there for about a month. Then they took me to\n   a real prison. I remember they asked us to do jobs like clean your cell,\n   clean the bathrooms, and things like that. Again, I was only 18 years old.\n   I didn't know why I was put in prison with those people. In there, yes, I\n   met some people that really had done some really bad stuff.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Was this a maximum security?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I don't know. I don't think it was maximum security, but it was a federal\n   prison. I think it was called ____________ or something like that. I was\n   there for a couple more months. It was the same thing in there. If you were\n   Mexican, you had to be with Mexicans. There were people in there from\n   Russia. There were people from all over the world. But it was a federal\n   prison. I remember asking, \"Is this an immigration prison or is this a\n   federal prison?\" \"No, it's both. We keep both immigrants and\u2026 you know\"\n   Yeah, I did get scared a lot, especially with just being 18 years old and\n   being with people who are either double my age or older. They really had\n   gang tattoos all over their face. They had marks. They had a lot of things\n   going on with them. I remember hearing stories that they did. I was like,\n   \"Wow.\"\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   [43:33] They would ask me, \"So why are you in here for?\" I didn't want to\n   lie because I didn't want to make them think that I was a bad person or\n   like, \"Yeah, I'm hard, too.\" I was like, \"No, I'm just here because I'm\n   illegal.\" Then I remember a group of Mexicans from Mexico City approaching\n   me. It was like 18 people. They were like, \"So, why are you here?\" \"I'm\n   just illegal.\" They put me in a room. I thought, I don't know, you hear a\n   lot of stories that they're going to do to you. But they were actually \u2013\n   They had my back. It was like, \"You are our youngest guy here. Don't worry.\n   We're going to take care of you. What do you need?\" They gave me food, they\n   gave me clothing, they gave me sandals.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   These are inmates.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yeah, inmates. They said, \"We're going to protect you but at the same time\n   if you see something happening, you need to step up. It doesn't matter if\n   your cellmate is white. If he goes out and harms another one of our guys,\n   you have to step in. If not, we're going to step you out.\" Luckily nothing\n   ever happened when I was in there. But it was drastically [unintelligible\n   43:48]. It was a new experience for me.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   You discovered racism in prison.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Real racism. In school you always hear people talking, but then the next\n   day we're friends again. We have to be in the same class and do group\n   activities. I guess now that I think about it, those kids, they were just\n   acting what they would see on TV or what their parents taught them. But,\n   yeah, once I got to prison, I guess I felt it more directly. During high\n   school, it's just a normal shit talker saying, \"Hey, go back to Mexico, you\n   don't belong here.\" You can always defend yourself there, saying, \"Hey,\n   you're not even from here neither, so what are you talking about?\" Or \"I\n   could be more American than you. Ask me any question and I'll answer it\n   just as well as you can.\" I guess that was our power was being able to\n   speak English and say, \"Hey, I can speak Spanish and you can't and I'm\n   already learning French,\" because I took French classes. \"You don't even -\"\n   Things like that. It was just more like bullies trying to be a bully.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Yeah.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Not really a racist. I do remember when I was working in construction, we\n   went to a chicken house to do a couple of jobs there. One of the guys, not\n   my co-workers but one of the guys that I guess it was his property, he did\n   say something that I got offended at. But at the same time, I said, \"Well,\n   it's kind of real.\" He said that he had left out some shoes or boots out on\n   the field and the next day that he went to go get them, they weren't there.\n   He said, \"One of those Mexicans probably stole them.\" It was probably true\n   because there were some people that did those activities, but at the same\n   time you're not sure. What if it was one of your own guys? Or what if you\n   misplaced them? I did get back at him. I remember getting some scissors and\n   I started cutting all his fence. I just started cutting the wires like,\n   \"Okay. Now you can really talk about it. Yes.\" I guess that was my form of\n   defending myself. I don't think it was the best thing.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I remember that day I was crying back home. I said, \"How can people just, I\n   don't know, how can they discriminate if really if we take out our skin,\n   we're the same on the inside? We both have flesh and bone. We're going to\n   bleed the same.\" I'm like, \"It doesn't matter where you're from. We're the\n   same on the inside.\" I guess that was one of the few things because I\n   worked with American people my whole life. They gave me jobs, they fed me,\n   they would invite me into their house. Some people had pools, said, \"Hey,\n   we're going to have a pool party and I want you to come because you're one\n   of my workers.\" Christmas parties where the company invites the whole\n   co-workers to eat. I don't think I felt it until that day and until I\n   arrived to prison.\n"

I learned\n   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started\n   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go\n   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's\n   like, \"Wow. So, it was just all about image.\" If you look nice, they're\n   going to treat you nice.

Just so that you can seem legit.\" I'm like,\n   \"Okay. I can do that, I guess.\" I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,\n   \"Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?\" I said, \"Why not? Maybe\n   it could be better.\" So, I did change for that school, but then I realized\n   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to\n   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, \"No. I can't do that no more.\n   I can't.\" Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's\n   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.\n   So, I said, \"No. I have to quit.

            "interview_part": "\n   Maybe we can start with your arms.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   My arms.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Illegal Mexican.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yes.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Where does that come from?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Well, since I learned that I was living illegally in the United States, I\n   got discriminated for that. They would call me \u201cillegal Mexican.\u201d So I took\n   that as a positive thing and said, \"Yes, I am,\" and I felt like I needed to\n   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because\n   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United\n   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to\n   represent them. I didn't get the tattoos until I came back to Mexico.\n   That's how it started. I do remember in high school, most of my friends\n   that I hung out with were all Mexican, we were all born in Mexico. I guess\n   that's how it started, just hanging out with friends and making jokes about\n   it.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Eventually it became something that we represented. Other people knew that\n   we were illegal so we took that another step and we said, \"Yes. Yes, we\n   are. We are illegal aliens. We are, but we're also Americans. We share the\n   same traditions, we celebrate Thanksgiving, we celebrate the 4th of July.\"\n   We had to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the\n   Americans. That's how it started.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Let me ask you a question about that because I've thought about that in the\n   past year or so of this work. That everybody who we talk to in your\n   situation, describes themselves as being illegal. And ee who consider\n   ourselves pro-migrant, et cetera, we use all these other words. Right?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Right.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   We don't say illegal. We say, \"undocumented,\" or, \"unauthorized,\" or\n   whatever. Why do you guys describe yourselves as illegal? Why do we\n   describe you -- we jump through all this stuff. How does that sound to you?\n   It's something I've been thinking about.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I guess it's the-\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   You're literally wearing it on your sleeve.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Yes.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I live it. I guess this is the street slang. We always use different\n   vocabulary than the ones they use just to be different, I guess. We have\n   our own lingo. We definitely want to represent. It's not like we're hiding\n   or anything, but we want to also express ourselves to our full potential. I\n   think that's one of the best ways. I got into the hip hop culture as a very\n   young child, so I knew that there was graffiti, there was music, there was\n   rapping, there was break dancing. We took that, and we placed our own\n   little bits of ourselves into it. I guess that's where it comes from. I've\n   heard immigrant. In school, I remember in elementary school, we were, there\n   was a class called ESL.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   Yeah.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   They would call us migrant students. And I didn't understand what it was\n   until I grew older and started looking at the vocabulary. I saw that it\n   could be you know, an alien. I said, \"Yes, we are aliens. We're from a\n   different planet called Mexico.\" I guess that's how it started and just\n   people picking on us that we're illegal, \"Go back to your country,\" and\n   things like that. We definitely wanted to make that statement. Like, \"Yes,\n   we are illegal. So what?\" That's how it started.\n"

            "interview_part": "\n   Do you feel Mexican or American or both?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I've always been asked that question.\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   I know.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I always say, \"I can be more Mexican because I love history and I love\n   studying about my culture here as a Mexican. I know more than the average\n   person does about Mexico.\" Then they question me about, \"How is it like to\n   be an American?\" I have that answer also. But now-\n \n \n   Anita:\n \n \n   What's that answer?\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Now I don't want to be a nationality. I want to be a human. If aliens from\n   different planet come, they're going to be, \"Oh, wait, not the Mexicans\n   because they're cool. Not the Americans.\" No, they're going to say, \"Hey,\n   all of you are humans and we're going to take over.\" I hope it never\n   happens, but I don't think I want to be Mexican. I don't think I want to be\n   American. I just want to be human. I think because if we are placed in that\n   category of just a nationality, then it reduces everything because people\n   categorize. Even in movies, they say, \"Best Mexican actor,\" or something\n   like that. Like, \"No. He's an actor or an actress. He or she shouldn't be\n   categorized as best Mexican or best Hispanic. They're humans. They have the\n   talent just like anybody else.\"\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I don't want to say that I'm Mexican or American. I am both. I'm\n   bi-cultural. I just don't like that. I don't like what they say. I'd rather\n   we say, \"Hey, we're human. You and I are human.\" Yes, later on we get that,\n   later on they tell us, \"Okay, you were born in Mexico so that makes you\n   Mexican.\" But since we're born, we're born as human, not even as a woman or\n   a man. We're born as a human. Yeah. I get asked that question a lot.\n"

I guess,\n   the music. Yeah, the music, I guess. Yeah, not too sure. The lifestyle, I'm\n   used to having more money, and the style too like... here I guess. Well,\n   here in Mexico, it's more varied, but where I'm from, el rancho , they\n   dress a certain way. They have their own style.

Yeah, I lived over\n   there, but I was born here.\" So it's like, yeah they don't see me as too\n   Mexican. I see myself as Mexican. It's because of that I said not too much.\n \n \n   Lizzy: I've heard a lot of people say things where it's like you don't feel\n   like you belong here, but you don't belong there either.\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah. There's a saying. Ni de aqui ni de alla. [neither from her\n   nor there]\n \n \n   Lizzy: Do you feel like that?\n \n \n   Yordani: Yeah. I mean now I feel like more part of here now that I have\n   spent more time here, so I'm getting used to it here. I guess I'm seeing\n   myself more as a Mexican citizen now. I'd still like to go there though, I\n   still want to... I don't know. I guess I was a citizen, I wish I was a\n   citizen of Mexico and the United States. That'd be fucking awesome.

Why?\" So it was really embarrassing for me.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Did you tell your friends or people at school?\n \n \n   Yordani: No, I\u2019ve only one friend. I guess the feedback that he gave me,\n   it's like I guess I didn't want to tell anybody. I felt really like...\n   Yeah, I guess just ashamed for it. And then just scared, the police,\n   they're going to ask me if I'm legal or not. And it became even more scary\n   when I was in high school, middle school, and I was with the bad crowd and\n   we bought some cans and spray painted this church. And the church was\n   really nice. They didn't put charges and when we were cleaning they took us\n   to eat. They were just really nice, you know?\n \n \n   Yordani: And so, when that happened, the police, they talked with me and my\n   mom, they were like, \"Hey, we know you're illegal. You know? We're not\n   going to report you to immigration. We just want a clean community, we just\n   don't want any problems.\" But still, it's like now they know. It's like,\n   they know. Next time I do something, it's going to be, I guess, I'm just\n   going to get kicked out or something. So it just created a fear.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So that made you really nervous.\n \n \n   Yordani: Anytime I had an encounter with the police, it just like... Oh, I\n   have to say like red and white or something. I'd just really just feel very\n   panicked inside. And it didn't help that sometimes I guess they'd tell my\n   mom you know like, \"Hey, immigration's around, don't open the door, if\n   somebody knocks check who it is.\" It's like dang, you know?\n"

I've seen a couple of family members or friends here\n   that are like 30 years old and they're still living with their dad and mom.\n   They're just like not doing anything for their life, and opposed of people\n   out there, most of them that I do know were just living by themselves and\n   doing their thing. I'd say out there it's probably not that good because\n   you\u2019d get, because most of the people would get into some kind of a drug\n   addiction or something like that. I\u2019d say, here, here it'd be probably the\n   same, but out there it'd be easier to make money. Here it's a lot harder.\n   That's probably what's the difference here to there. That's what I'm\n   saying, I think out there you learn how to be strong. When you come here,\n   you're just like, \"Oh.\" most people get depressed or frustrated here.\n   Others actually know how to move on and continue. That's probably how I see\n   it.\n"

I just got paid to do that. And when I\n   wasn't working with that, I would travel a lot with my dad. My dad would\n   work with construction. I would just be with my dad or do my thing, and\n   that's it, basically.\n \n \n   Claudia: What did you like about snowboarding and surfing?\n \n \n   Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to\n   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free\n   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there\n   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know\n   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I\n   don't know, it was always really into water.\n \n \n   Yosell: I can remember when I was just a little kid, my dad would actually\n   take me out to San Francisco and Venice Beach and all those kinds of\n   beaches to just kick it. And I would see a bunch of my cousins surfing, so\n   I think that's where it came on. I think I like almost any other sport,\n   really, it's just like something that my dad put us into. He would take me,\n   and I have two little brothers, out dirt biking a lot.\n \n \n   Claudia: When you say you had a sponsorship, does that mean that you\n   competed?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah. It usually would take us out, and my dad would actually come\n   with me, since I was still a minor, and it would just get a couple of\n   videos into it, just do my stuff basically. That's all I would do.\n \n \n   Claudia: Did you ever see yourself doing that when you were older?\n \n \n   Yosell: I actually used to get paid for that out there, but just since I\n   did end up just coming out to Mexico, I talked to my sponsor\u2014which his name\n   was called Jones, he was my manager out there\u2014and I told him, \"Hey, you\n   know what? I'm going out to Mexico.\" And I got to say thanks and that's it.\n   And he actually tried\u2014when I got out to Mexico, I had contact with him a\n   lot\u2014he's telling me, \"Hey, I want to see if we can get you a green card or\n   something.\" I kind of didn't want to go back out to the States. I kind of\n   just wanted to stay here. I really didn't even know Mexico, so that was\n   part of it. I surfed a couple of times here in Mexico, but it's expensive\n   out here to do something.

Either you join something and\n   you're known as hardcore, you're known as somebody, or you don't join\n   anything and you get bullied around. That's what I could say.\n"
