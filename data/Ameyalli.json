Did you work in Mexico before you went to the United States?\nAmeyalli:        No.\nAnita:        Why did you go to the United States? Was it for economic reasons? Was it because of the violence? Was it to reunite with family?\nAmeyalli:        I think for economic reasons.\nAnita:        How old were you when you migrated to the United States?

I think in the school.\nAnita:        You went to school?\nAmeyalli:        And I worked too.\nAnita:        How would you describe your English skills now?\nAmeyalli:        Where are the options?\nAnita:        None, poor, moderate, good or fluent.\nAmeyalli:        I think moderate.\nAnita:        Moderate?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah.\nAnita:        Good?\nAmeyalli:        Well, yeah, good.\nAnita:        Maybe not fluent but good. In what cities did you live in the United States? We'll put moderate if you feel uncomfortable.\nAmeyalli:        In Fresno, in California.\nAnita:        In Fresno, California. All the time?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. All the time.\nAnita:        So you went to school in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        Yes, in the _______ High School.\nAnita:        Did you finish high school?\nAmeyalli:        Not there. I finished here.\nAnita:        So how many\u2026 what grade did you finish there?\nAmeyalli:        I was like for one year, no, two years.\nAnita:        Two years. So you did ninth grade and tenth grade, do you remember?\nAmeyalli:        It's a little bit confusing for me even now, because I don\u2019t know\u2026 it's different. It's different, but yeah, I think I made only two years of the high school.\nAnita:        Two years of high school. So let's put 10th grade. Did you work in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. For my neighbors.\nAnita:        For your neighbors. How many years did you work in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        For two years, I think.\nAnita:        Two years?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        What jobs did you do?

Like $20.\nAnita:        $20 an hour? Who did you live with when you were in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        With my aunt, with my cousins, and my mom.\nAnita:        And your mom. Okay. Were you frightened of the US authorities, of immigration, of the police? Were you afraid of them?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Why were you afraid of them?\nAmeyalli:        Well it's a different country, and you know how laws work, and it's another world.  And of course, different things make you scared.\nAnita:        Did you send money to relatives in Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        No.\nAnita:        No. How long did you live in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        Like three years, maybe.\nAnita:        Did you follow the US news when you were in the United States? What was happening politically?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        You did?\nAmeyalli:        I did, yes.\nAnita:        How did you follow it? Because you would talk about it with family and friends?\nAmeyalli:         Yes.\nAnita:        ...social media or TV or radio?\nAmeyalli:        I think with friends and family, because my aunt she knows how to speak English like really, really fluent. She has there 50 years, and now she's a resident and their kids too, my cousins. They were talking about it. The new laws and Donald Trump, of course, and all the bad things. So, we get scared and we came back. Yeah.\nAnita:        So, did you follow what was going on in Mexico too?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Again, by talking with your family, by listening to TV or radio or...?\nAmeyalli:        I think more with talking with my family. Like all the violence, all the... And it is true, it is true.\nAnita:        What year did you go to the United States?\nAmeyalli:        What year? I think between 2014 and 2015. I don't remember exactly.\nAnita:        What caused you to leave the United States? Did you take the decision to leave? Were you detained and deported or...?\nAmeyalli:        No, I wasn't detained.\nAnita:        You decided to leave?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah. Me and my mom, we were scared, and we just decided to come back.\nAnita:        What were you scared of?\nAmeyalli:        To get deported. So, it was like, you know what, let's just do it before it happens, because we think it was going to be like a violent situation or something like that. So, we just decided to come back.\nAnita:        How long have you been back in Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        Well, first I was living in Jalisco.\nAnita:        But in the country, Mexico.\nAmeyalli:        Like two years.\nAnita:        Two years.\nAmeyalli:        Maybe. Yes.\nAnita:        Where do you live now?\nAmeyalli:        I live now by the metro _________.\nAnita:        So in Mexico City?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. In Mexico City.\nAnita:        Who do you live with now?\nAmeyalli:        I live with my\u2026\nAnita:        Partner?\nAmeyalli:        Partner, yeah.\nAnita:        Do you know of programs that help people who lived in the United States and who have come back? Do you know of any programs?\nAmeyalli:        I know New Comienzos.\nAnita:        New Comienzos, ok. Do you know of any government programs?\nAmeyalli:        No. Any. No, never. I never heard about it.\nAnita:        Has New Comienzos helped you?\nAmeyalli:        Personally, no.\nAnita:        Have you studied at all? Taken any classes since you've been back?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. I finished high school here, and I'm in plans to go to the university.\nAnita:        What do you want to study?\nAmeyalli:        I think I want to study psychology. I want to be a psychologist.\nAnita:        Great.\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Returning migrants need you.\nAmeyalli:        Yeah. I think everybody in the world feels lost or sad or depressed for once in his life at least.\nAnita:        Yeah, that's for sure. But people who have been deported feel very depressed, right?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. So their families, their lifestyle, school, the friends, the money, everything. Everything. It's another thing.\nAnita:        Since you have been back, do you have a job?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. I have a job.\nAnita:        What jobs have you had since you've been back?\nAmeyalli:        Well, when I came back, I was working at Televisa. It's a call center.\nAnita:        In a call center?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah. And I was in semi-bilingual because they discriminate against me because of my accent. But now I think it's a little bit better, no? And now I'm working in ______.\nAnita:        Another call center?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah, another call center.\nAnita:        How much are you being paid for your job now?\nAmeyalli:        Now? 3000 a week plus bonus and [inaudible 00:12:48] and everything else.\nAnita:        Do you feel safe in Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        No. No. No. No. Here's not safe, no, no, no, no, no. I had a situation before, a week ago, where I was just walking to my house and some guy just touched my butt, and he was on a bike and he go faster, and I can't do anything. It's like, oh, my God, this is really happening. It makes me feel bad, of course. Then two weeks ago I was with my boyfriend, and we were in a party and some guys just start getting crazy, and they just grab us and they have... I don't know how it is in English. Un marro [a sledgehammer]. It's like a big...\nAnita:        A hammer.\nAmeyalli:        Big, like the biggest one, and they just hit him in the face.\nAnita:        Oh, that's why he can't speak.\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Okay, I was trying to figure out.\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Oh, my God.\nAmeyalli:        Yes. Here's not safe.\nAnita:        Okay. I was wondering. So do you feel that vulnerable because as a returning migrant?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah, I think so.\nAnita:        Was it difficult to come back to Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        I'm going to read you some questions and you'll tell me whether they were difficult. Was it difficult to find a job?\nAmeyalli:        I think, yes. I think yes.\nAnita:        Did you have other economic difficulties?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Was it hard to finish your education?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Was your\u2026 did you have family separation that was difficult?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Was it difficult to find a network of friends?\nAmeyalli:        Yeah, I think so, yes.\nAnita:        Language no or yes?\nAmeyalli:        No.\nAnita:        Was it difficult to adapt to Mexican culture?\nAmeyalli:        I think not really because my mom is really Mexican. She has the Mexican blood and everything, and she was always treating me like if we were in Mexico always.\nAnita:        Have you suffered from discrimination?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Really?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. I have. We had a situation like a month ago. We were eating, it was like 9:00 PM. And we were eating some hot dogs from the street. And I was speaking English with my boyfriend and another friend. So one guy talked to us directly, \u201cHey, this is Mexico. You can't speak English. Here in Mexico we speak Spanish. I hate pochos [Americanized Mexicans]. I hate deported people.\u201d And I was like, \u201coh my God.\u201d It really makes us feel horrible, horrible. And actually, my boyfriend, he wanted to fight with him, but I was like, \u201chey, you know what? It's the ignorance speaking. You've got to be smarter than that. Don't do it, don\u2019t do nothing.\u201d\nAnita:        Why do you think Mexicans act that way?\nAmeyalli:        I think they are just ignorant. I think that's the only answer that I have. It's the ignorance because we are Mexican. It doesn't matter if you speak English or you speak Spanish or you speak Nahuatl. We are all Mexicans. I don't know why they are like that. And it's not the first time. It's not the only time that we had that kind of situation.\nAnita:        Did you face bureaucratic difficulties with bureaucracies?\nAmeyalli:        Not really. Not in my case.\nAnita:        Did you suffer from any depression or emotional problems coming back?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Did you have any problems of substance abuse or addiction when you came back?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Any other challenges that I didn't ask you about?\nAmeyalli:        Well I think, no. I think all changes are difficult.\nAnita:        Do you still have family living in the United States?\nAmeyalli:        Yes.\nAnita:        Who?\nAmeyalli:        My aunt, my cousins. Now my dad, their new family. His new family. Yes, it's just me and my mom.\nAnita:        Are any of them US citizens?\nAmeyalli:        Yes, my aunt and my cousins.\nAnita:        Have they come to visit you?\nAmeyalli:        No. Well, long time ago before I went to there.\nAnita:        No, but since you've been back.\nAmeyalli:        No. Never.\nAnita:        Are they considering coming to live in Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        No. Believe me, no.\nAnita:        Why do you say it like that?\nAmeyalli:        Because well, here's really pretty. This is a gorgeous city, but it's not the same life that you can live there. Here you can make money, of course, but there is another life, you know?\nAnita:        What's the difference?\nAmeyalli:        Well, there's discrimination too, of course, but I don't know. The money, the jobs, it's easier to get a car. Just that kind of things, little things like that. It's a huge difference between Mexico and the States. I think they are fine there.\nAnita:        Do you follow US news now?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. I do.\nAnita:        How do you follow it, family and friends, social media, TV, radio?\nAmeyalli:        I don't have a TV. I think I do it just on social media.\nAnita:        Social media.\nAmeyalli:        And there's a page. The name is 4chan. 4chan. Number four and chan. And there's a section what is called Politically Incorrect and there's all the things about the US.\nAnita:        Not very flattering, I bet.\nAmeyalli:        Yeah.\nAnita:        Do you think you'll return to the United States someday?\nAmeyalli:        I wish, but I don't know. I'm not sure about it.\nAnita:        Not sure. If you decide to return, why would that be, because of economic reasons, because of the situation of violence and insecurity here, because of discrimination, to reunite with your family, which reasons?\nAmeyalli:        I think economical reasons, and I think because of all the violence in Mexico City and, of course, family too.\nAnita:        And if you decide not to return, why would you decide not to return?\nAmeyalli:        The government, yes. And discrimination too. There is discrimination everywhere. I mean, you can't avoid that.\nAnita:        Well, you can. Do you currently participate or volunteer in Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        I volunteer with collecting this [shows bag of bottlecaps] for little kids with cancer.\nAnita:        Wow.\nAmeyalli:        And, yes, I need to get a thousand of it to give cancer therapy.\nAnita:        Chemotherapy.\nAmeyalli:        Yes. To some kids.\nAnita:        So you sell those?\nAmeyalli:        No, no, no.\nAnita:        What is it?\nAmeyalli:        I just collect them and I give it to... It's an association. So I give it to them and they just pay the-\nAnita:        And what are they? Bottle caps?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. Bottle caps from Sprite, Coke.\nAnita:        Wow.\nAmeyalli:        Everything. Tea.\nAnita:        So what is it, recycling? What is this?\nAmeyalli:        I think it is recycle.\nAnita:        Wow. So do you think that living in the United States changed you in some ways?\nAmeyalli:        I think, yes.\nAnita:        In what ways?\nAmeyalli:        It's another country, it's another law, it's another people. I discovered the beauty of another country, but I discovered too that there's a lot of discrimination too, and I discovered bad things too, you know? And I think that kind of thing is the things that makes you stronger as a person, everything. And I think being in the States changed me, first of all, because I learned another language. I learned another lifestyle. I learned that there's more that goes on. I don't know. I love Mexico. Of course. I love Mexico, I love everything of my country. But I think Mexicans, we are, sometimes we have a poor mind. We just stay in the box. We don't go for more. We just stay\u2026 we like comfortable things. We like to be like that. Being in the States showed me to go over. Because I think, if I were just in Mexico probably I will work in [inaudible 00:25:41], or I don't know. I don\u2019t know. That makes me grow too.\nAnita:        If you had been able to stay in the United States, if you hadn't had been afraid of immigration and deportation, what would you have wanted to do with your life?\nAmeyalli:        I think I'm a business girl. I would like to make maybe a restaurant. Yeah, maybe Mexican food, maybe another thing, maybe have a bar too. Always food and alcohol, it's for sure. You're going to have customers. Food and alcohol. That's what people like. I think I would like to have my own restaurant.\nAnita:        And do you think that people who have lived in the United States and who've come back have something special to give Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        Well I don\u2019t know. I don't know about another person's, but I think they regret about being here. I think they hate being here. I think they hate their lives or they are not that comfortable.\nAnita:        But do you think that in terms of what they have to offer the country, do you think they have special things to offer the country? That would be good for Mexico?\nAmeyalli:        Yes. Of course.\nAnita:        What are those?\nAmeyalli:        Well, they are biculture. They are bilingual. They have everything to be on the top, but there is a lot of limits that they had. I think they can offer the knowledge. More than anything. Knowledge, experience. And I don\u2019t know, they can do a lot for Mexico in general for the country. I'm pretty sure that they can. \nAnita:        Okay, Well, thank you very, very much for sharing.\nAmeyalli:        You're welcome.",
