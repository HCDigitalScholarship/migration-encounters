  "text":"\n Anne: You said you went to the States when you were three months old?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, obviously, you don't have any memories of that. But why did your\n parents decide to take you?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, they decided to take me because of hardships here. My father\n had already left to the United States. He was already working over there\n when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left\n to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my\n mother, my brother and I, and took us with him, back to Dallas, around the\n outskirts of Dallas.\n      \n      \n Ben: He was good with horses, so he was working at a horse stable, a\n very prominent horse stable, that caters to most of the people around SMU,\n or Southern Methodist University, that keep all their horses there. So,\n mainly it was to give us a better life, because things are bad around that\n little town. There's no opportunities.\n      \n      \n Anne: And how did you learn English?\n      \n      \n Ben: How did I learn English? English, when my father was working at\n the horse stables of course I grew up around it because the owners of the\n stables, they would talk to us in English and they would give us candies,\n they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he\n had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have\n my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be\n able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's\n the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to\n learn, was that little recording machine.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you were playing this game with the tapes\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: With the tapes and stuff and then later we started elementary\n school and then once I started elementary school, it changed. Well my\n mother had a rule, she goes, \"No English inside of the house.\u201d Before, it\u2019s\n \u201cSpeak English, speak English,\u201d but once we started school, she goes, \"I\n don't want you all speaking English here inside the house\u201d to me and my\n brother. And we used to think that\u2019s because she didn't understand, but it\n was because she wanted us to practice the Spanish.\n      \n      \n Ben: And when I would get home from school when I was going to\n kindergarten\u2014my brother would get out an hour later\u2014I would get home and my\n mother would give me these little comic magazines, Mexican comic magazines,\n and she'd have me read them. And then she would make me write letters to my\n grandmother. So that's how I was able to learn a little bit of, keep the\n Spanish and English. But English I did, I went through elementary, middle\n school, went to tenth grade in high school, then I dropped out of high\n school to go help my father. He started a small construction business, but\n then he got sick and he was hospitalized for three months.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then after dad got better and went back to work, I still\n stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to\n go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED\n program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I\n just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college\n courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on\n them!\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: I thought it was too, but I still miss the graduation experience\n and all that. I missed out on that, but regardless, I kept going and I just\n went mainly into construction, stayed with drywall and did really well.\n When I married Bena, I started a business of my own and it struggled at\n first, but then I was persistent and everything just, it just changed from\n one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like\n working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And\n then finally, poof and from there everything changed.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, when you were in high school, did you feel like just any other\n American kid?\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yeah. Yeah. Yes, I felt normal, I had a lot of friends and our\n high school, the high school I went to, there was very few Hispanics-\n period, very few blacks. If you looked at that high school, if you pulled\n it up\u2014well actually they made them remove the confederate flag, because the\n confederate flag was part of, it was the school football team logo and it\n was on their helmets. They were called the Southland Prairie Warriors, and\n when they ran out on the football field, they carried the confederate\n flag\u2014and the high school flew the confederate flag up with the Texas and US\n flag\u2014which it would make you think the opposite. I can't say that the\n school was\u2026Of course there were a few people, but I did okay. I didn't feel\n out of place and I felt pretty well accepted by others.\n      \n      \n Anne: And did your mom work too? Or just your dad?\n      \n      \n Ben: My mom, she worked quite a bit, but there was a period when my\n youngest sister was born, she ceased from working and she stayed home with\n her for a few years. And then once\u2014I think my sister was about four years\n old\u2014then she went back and started working again until we were doing good\n in the construction. When I jumped into the construction and started my own\n business, then my dad went to work for me. And when he went to work for me,\n then my mother didn't have to work any more. We were really doing pretty\n well, we did pretty well. Did a lot of construction projects all throughout\n the Midwest and eastern seaboard. Lot of government projects.\n      \n      \n Anne: Really?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. A lot of low-income housing for the government.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you moved around, it wasn't a local company that just stayed\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: I based my company in Indianapolis and the main reason that we\n ended up based in Indianapolis is that I had a project going on in Akron,\n Ohio, one in Indianapolis and then I had two coming up in the Kansas\n City\u2014in both-- Kansas City, Missouri, Kansas City, Kansas. And I knew it\n was going to be a lot of jumping around, and I figured well Indianapolis\n will be right in the center. So, I rented an apartment there for me and my\n wife and my son and my daughter; my son was a baby, but my daughter, she\n was like four years old, or three years old.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then right about after that, we bought a house. Well, no, my\n wife wanted to enroll my daughter in pre-K to get her going because her\n age. Her date of birth and the cut off with the school, they won't let her\n in for regular elementary school. So, she found this church and she told\n me, \"There's this church that's got pre-K and we're going to get her\n started there.\u201d And I go, \"Well okay, go ahead.\u201d So, we enrolled her there\n and we ended up getting involved with that church and we were the only\n Hispanics at the church at the time, whenever we did it. But they were good\n to us and they still attend there.\n      \n      \n Ben: That church, they started building one year on, every year they\n would add a year onto the school. And my daughter was one of the original\n students. So, she's one of the original students. The first original\n student to go all the way through the academy and graduate.\n      \n      \n Anne: What's it called?\n      \n      \n Ben: Cornerstone Baptist Academy in Indianapolis.\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you dropped out of high school to help with your dad because he\n was sick and then you got your GED without studying.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: And you then went to community college. The community college, the\n courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?\n Did you think about that?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured\n would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For\n instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of\n the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--\n definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance\n because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real\n estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor\n in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,\n but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in\n Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the\n opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that\n much capital to be able to take that much more on.\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, come these home equity loans, finance pulled money out of\n the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines\n of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and\n free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all\n the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and\n trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,\n later as a substitute.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you were in Texas initially, is that where you got married?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes, in Texas.\n      \n      \n Anne: Your wife. When did the business start blossoming to help you move\n out of Texas?\n      \n      \n Ben: The business started blossoming when we were in Texas. I had told\n my wife to give me\u2026Within five years we'll have a house and we'll both have\n good vehicles, dependable vehicles, but it's going to take a while. Well\n within a year and a half from when I started, we bought out first house and\n we both had good, dependable vehicles. However, it was still tight when I\n took a project on in Akron, Ohio. And when I took that project on, I did\n not want to go up there for many reasons. One, because I had this\n immigration issue on me and I'm going near the Canadian border. Another, I\n didn't really want to be away from my family.\n      \n      \n Ben: But when these customers get persistent, \"What's it going to take?\n What's it going to take?\" And I said, \"It's just out of the question. I\n can't go up there, I got all these jobs going on. Plus, I got bad\n equipment, my equipment\u2019s old and if my equipment breaks down up there, I'm\n not going to be able to meet the schedules and we're all going to be in\n trouble.\u201d \"Is that it? Really?\" The last price he had upped the price of\n what the contract was to pay, and the pay was fine. I had other reasons why\n I didn't want to go. Well when he says, \"I'll throw in a brand-new texture\n machine on top of it, but I'll sign off on the paperwork after you complete\n the project.\u201d And I go, \"You'll do that?\" \"I'll do that and when have you\n known me to not keep my word?\" And I go, \"Done deal.\u201d\n      \n      \n Ben: One of those texture machines, the price tag at that time was\n about $30,000. Right now, it's probably closer to $40,000 because we're\n talking about 1996. And he followed through, I came up to Akron, when I got\n up to Akron though, they had projects, there were projects everywhere,\n Kentucky, Michigan. And the pay, the pay was awesome. And that is where it\n really, within I think about the second month that I was up north, it just\n completely changed.\n      \n      \n Ben: But I hadn't seen my wife and children since I had taken off up\n there. So, I told her to come up there and visit and I started discuss with\n her. I go, \"Look these other jobs,\u201d and I had already said I was going to\n take them, but I didn't tell her that. I told her, she says, \"What if you\n go to be traveling?\" I go, \"It's worth it to be traveling back and forth,\n but I'm not going to be traveling back and forth. We're going to just take\n the kids; we're going to move up here and we're going to be together\".\n      \n      \n Ben: And so that's when I moved them to Indianapolis. We stationed in\n Indianapolis although I did travel quite a bit. I was on the road quite a\n bit because I had later ended up with jobs as far down as Orlando, Florida.\n And I ended up in New Orleans after Hurricane Katrina to repair a bunch of\n apartments which we had worked on before. But it was a pretty wild ride,\n but we really were doing really well, and it was really amazing.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah. So, in Texas, you couldn't get a license, could you?\n      \n      \n Ben: I had a license, I did.\n      \n      \n Anne: So how did you get it?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, the thing is that I had, when I was 19 I had a brush with\n the law and I took care of it, but then ICE came looking for me, they\n didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they\n left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something\n happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I\n tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a\n pretty high, outrageous bond and\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: When you were 19?\n      \n      \n Ben: No, 19 is when I got in trouble. They came back looking for me, I\n was already what? I think I was 27, going on, 27, 28.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh wow.\n      \n      \n Ben: And so, I go to the immigration office in Dallas and I went in and\n then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to\n Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm\n going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, \"No,\u201d so\n I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the\n attorney, I knew he was just wanting to. I probably could've, maybe it was\n a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years\n at a young age, two years and then at the end, maybe nothing.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked\n the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to\n Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before\n Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico. And then I stayed there in Saltillo\n up through December, through Christmas. Christmas my parents came to visit,\n and my girlfriend had come to visit too, my girlfriend had come to visit\n around Christmas and then they left.\n      \n      \n Anne: They were all citizens?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. And then we had plans to get married and my girlfriend, she\n was willing to come live here, give everything up in the states and live\n here, even though she's a citizen. So, I said, \"Well if you really feel\n strongly then come on.\u201d So, she came to Mexico and when she arrived here in\n Mexico, I went to pick her up at the border, she came on the bus right\n across from Eagle Path. So, I met her there and then brought her back to my\n family's house.\n      \n      \n Ben: Then we get there and we're there\u2014and then my parents had arrived\n there too\u2014and she goes, \"When are we heading back?\" because she thought we\n were going to Saltillo, because I told her it's a big city, better\n opportunities there. I go, \"Oh we're not going to Saltillo.\u201d She goes,\n \"Well where are we going?\" I go, \"You think I'm going to sit here and years\n later we're going to be worried about our kids, where they're at, because\n you know they're not going to stay put here. They're going to jump that\n border.\u201d And I go, \"So what are we going to do?\" \"Well I'm going to take\n that risk right now, I'm going to jump it right now.\u201d She goes, \"No you\n can't.\u201d I go, \"You watch me. Let's go, we're leaving tomorrow\".\n      \n      \n Ben: And so, we left, and we went to Acu\u00f1a across from Del Rio (Texas)\n and then, \"No, just wait for me across the bridge. I'll be right there.\u201d\n So, \"No, no no.\u201d So, I got a taxicab straight across the bridge. But I had\n already had my Texas driver's license and social security card brought to\n me in case they questioned me, then I could say, \"US.\u201d And that's all I\n did, just told them I was a US citizen, they just\u2026It wasn't like it is\n right now. Right now, even a US citizen is going to have trouble getting\n across the bridge [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Ben: But over twenty, 22-23 years.\n      \n      \n Anne: 23 years? And were you worried about getting deported those 23 years?\n      \n      \n Ben: Right after my daughter was born, yes, every day, the thought\n would cross my mind. I had many brushes with Immigration, as we're in the\n construction business. Many times, job sites would get raided and the only\n thing was just to keep cool and walk straight up to them. Don't walk away\n from them, if I seen them walking this way, I walked towards them instead\n of walking away from them. I walked towards them.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, they probably, you being the head guy, they didn't think of you\n as much\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: No, but during the raids I don't think they had any idea of who\n was the head guy or not.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh.\n      \n      \n Ben: Because a lot of the times, a lot of these raids, I was all\n covered in drywall, compound, white compound all over me, almost like if\n you got paint all over me. But I just wouldn't\u2026I would just walk right up\n to them. And there was another gentleman\u2014this was amazing because he didn't\n speak English. And there was three times these raids that Immigration come\n up and you're talking about over 10-11 people just scatter. He would never\n run; he would stay put. And one time he was up on a scaffold and\n immigration officer, it was one vehicle pulls up front and just one\n officer, I knew that everybody else were all around in the back because\n there was a big old wall.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: And so, he finally gets out and comes inside the house and he\n walks right past me and that happened a couple times where they would just\n walk right past me, didn't even acknowledge that I was even there, nothing.\n I go, \"Is God making me invisible?\" [Chuckle]. It really felt like that\n because this time he didn't even acknowledge me, just walked right past me.\n He didn't see me. Anyhow, he walks up to this other person, he's on the\n scaffold and he goes, \"[Spanish 00:27:11] papels hombre?\u201d and from up there\n he goes, \"Yeah.\u201d And pulls out his wallet, left him alone. Walked away.\n      \n      \n Ben: And it was three times with that one person. And then after that\n last time that I was with him that happened, he goes, \"Look at that,\n they're taking all these poor guys that don't want to go. I want to go\n back, I want a free ride back. But they don't want to take me.\u201d And I spoke\n to a cousin of his, it\u2019s probably been about three years ago, and I asked\n him about him, and he says, \"To this day, he don't have his residency, he\n never got his papers.\u201d He's living in Atlanta now by the way, or he was\n when I talked to his cousin. His cousin goes, \"He's in Atlanta, but to this\n day he never got his papers and he's never been deported.\u201d And I go, \"Some\n people are lucky and some are not\".\n      \n      \n Anne: So, you built your company, your wife was a US citizen?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: And your two children?\n      \n      \n Ben: U.S. citizens.\n      \n      \n Anne: U.S. citizens and you sort of had a really nice middle-class life,\n right?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. Real nice life. And my children, they didn't know that I was\n illegal until it happened. And we had\u2026Well there was a reason why we didn't\n want them knowing because children can tell others. And then also they just\n wouldn't understand. When they were a little bit older, like my son in\n junior high and my daughter barely starting high school, do you remember\n when Lou Dobbs went off on his rant? On CNN, when he started all that. When\n Lou Dobbs started ranting, it was like every day on TV, the other school\n children were talking about illegal ladies and this and this. And one day I\n got home and my wife, the kids were already in bed, and she told me, \"You\n know what? Vanessa came up and asked me if any of our relatives were\n illegal aliens.\u201d And I told her, \"Probably about time we started explaining\n some things to her.\u201d She goes, \"No, with our relatives yes, but as far as\n you, no. You can't\"\n      \n      \n Ben: So, we didn't. And it was just, once they did find out, I really\n don't know, I'm really not sure how they really feel. But it had to be\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: They didn't find out until you actually\u2014\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: And they're adults now? Or young adults?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. And my daughter, I know it had to move her because after my\n daughter, this is her graduating from Indiana University with honors, very\n decorated.\n      \n      \n Anne: Beautiful.\n      \n      \n Ben: Her major is paralegal studies. She's still studying, she wants a\n law degree.\n      \n      \n Anne: That's great.\n      \n      \n Ben: And she did her internship at the Marian County prosecutor\u2019s\n office. She graduated and upon graduation\u2014well before she even\n graduated\u2014she had secured a job. She's got a job, she's got her first job,\n right now she's a paralegal for immigration family law.\n      \n      \n Anne: Oh wow. Wow.\n      \n      \n Ben: So, I guess it has something\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: Sure.\n      \n      \n Ben: My son, just barely last week he went to get settled. He was going\n to IUP [Indiana University of Pennsylvania] in Indianapolis, but he just\n got the Disney scholarship and it's a full scholarship, so room, board\n everything. And he just got settled last week in Orlando. So, he's going to\n be there for a little while.\n      \n      \n Anne: And what school does that go for?\n      \n      \n Ben: I'm not exactly sure, some university there in Orlando. I haven't\n had a lot of contact since\u2026They were busy over there, when they were over\n there, I was busy heading this way.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, what happened? What happened to bring you to detention and\n deportation?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, this last issue had to do with labor. I was used to these\n labor department investigations and this last few really started getting\n more intense though. I kind of think that it took a stronger turn with the\n Obama administration, to focus on these contracts and make sure that all\n the criteria in these prevailing wage jobs were really fulfilled to the T.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, for the federal contractors?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes. And I'm an illegal alien, but you can look me up in the\n Michigan records. And I'm registered there as a preferred government\n contractor. I did well over 200,000 units and for Amtrak, which is in a bad\n area of Detroit, and around other parts of Detroit, Wayne town. But there,\n Indiana and Ohio, Florida and Mississippi, Texas, I was a preferred\n government contractor. And did they know I was illegal? Damn right they\n did.\n      \n      \n Anne: They did?\n      \n      \n Ben: I know they did. There's no way that they couldn't have known. Did\n they care? No. They just needed their job done.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: At the end, I think they still didn't care but I think the heat\n got turned up and they started\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: That's all you can think of?\n      \n      \n Ben: That's all I can do. But I'm still grateful I did very well and my\n family's not hurting. If I felt that they were hurting, I would risk it all\n and head back. But, they're comfortable, they're doing well. And I think,\n well I feel that I set a standard for them, to strive to be more, to strive\n because they all had, including my wife, when we married she was kind of\n shy and her self-esteem\u2014not that she had low self-esteem\u2014but she really\n didn't believe that much in herself. But right now, she's shining, she's\n doing really well, and she's holding it together for both kids at that age\n to still be living with her, other than my son right now in college, that\n he went, that's to say a lot for two parents. But for a single parent, you\n gotta hand it to her.\n      \n      \n Anne: And when were you detained? How long ago?\n      \n      \n Ben: It's been about a year and a half ago, yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: And you fought it for a year and a half?\n      \n      \n Ben: No, no, no. No, no. I had gotten, I was in, it was about six\n months and then I got shipped over to Matamoras and I was at my family's\n house, my family has a house here on the border.\n      \n      \n Anne: I see.\n      \n      \n Ben: I mean it's a nice house. It's up in the mountains and I had a lot\n of family members, including my wife go, \"Why are you leaving? Why are you\n going to Mexico City? You don't need to.\u201d I go, \"Well one I'm going, I want\n to be involved in helping these people. I gotta go out and do something, I\n know I can still do something, I need a job. I need a job, I need a real\n job.\u201d Raising goats and sheep is fine and it was common people and stuff,\n but I'm a busy body and I need to do something.\n      \n      \n Ben: And then I became aware of New Comienzos and when I seen that,\n that's what I want to do. I want to go down there, I want to be involved in\n that. I want to be involved in that because that's something that I know I\n can help and contribute to. And at the same time, I can get me a job down\n there and I'll stay put. I'll come back and visit every now and then, but\n I'm a city person [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah. So, did you fight the detention or no?\n      \n      \n Ben: No. When my first, I was detained when I was 19\u2014well no, I got in\n trouble when I was 19, detained at 27. That time, I signed away, I didn't\n fight it. So, this time, I had no rights. I could not fight anymore because\n I'd already signed away. This time around, I probably would've fought it,\n because I had the money this time. Even if I knew I was going to lose, at\n least I knew I had the money for the bond and I could put it off two,\n three, four years. But, the first time I didn't have the money. So, I said,\n \u201cSit here two years and wait and then probably get deported? No.\u201d\n Unfortunately, this time, I just, there was no rights that I could\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: And have your kids or your wife been to visit you?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes, they have up there. Hopefully once I get settled here. My\n wife was supposed to come here in May, like around my birthday, which was\n the week before last. But when my son got this scholarship, well he said,\n \"We gotta go,\u201d so her and my daughter both drove him down to Orlando and\n they went to Disney, like we used to always go to Disney World. We would go\n at least twice a year. There was one year that I had two projects that ran\n over a year down there and I bought them season passes, because it was\n easier for them to fly down on the weekend and come see me. And when they\n come down, if you buy three individual park tickets, it's more expensive\n then the season pass.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: But they're still keeping up the traditions [Laughs]. They're\n still going to Disney.\n      \n      \n Anne: And you spent a lot of time volunteering while you were in the\n states.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes.\n      \n      \n Anne: So, it seems like, does that make it a good fit to try it here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yes. Yes, it's voluntary here, it's a different theme here.\n It's a stronger, I feel it's a stronger theme. Not that my volunteer work\n back over there wasn't, but my volunteer\u2026 Like helping out at the school\n whenever I was in town, I would let them know that I would be in town and I\n was available to substitute if one of the teachers needed a break or was\n going to be missing. And I was qualified to take the classes on.\n      \n      \n Ben: But I also was a volunteer English teacher when they started, they\n started a Spanish church. When that Spanish church started, it was actually\n my father that was the preacher. My father was at another church, but when\n they wanted to do that, I talked to my father to see if he would, because\n they asked me to, but I was honest, I go, \"You know I'm not that\n knowledgeable of the Bible, to be able to. I don't want to stumble over\n myself.\u201d And you know when people are barely getting into a church and you\n say one thing but then you contradict yourself, you're going to destroy\n their faith.\n      \n      \n Anne: Don't want to do that.\n      \n      \n Ben: No. And I did a lot of volunteer work there at the church and the\n school. It was great. And they've been right by my family's side, they're\n still going to church there and anytime that they need anything, they're\n right there. But good thing \u2026. they've been fine. My wife, she's got a\n pretty good job. She worked for a mortgage company, so she does pretty\n well. And my daughter helps out too now that she's making money. It's been\n a long ride. [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: So, we hear a lot of stories about young men who come over as babies\n or toddlers and then for some reason get caught up in gangs or crime. What\n was different for you? Why do you think that never happened?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, I can tell you that I think, probably the single most\n important thing, the most important thing in a person's life is\n environment. Parenting is important, but you can have the best parents in\n the world, but if you have them in a bad environment, your parenting is not\n going to supersede the environment. And that's one of the things that I\n focus with my wife is that\u2014well my parents, they provided a good\n environment. And when I got married from my life experiences, I stepped\n that up a bit. I told a lot of other relatives, this is one thing I've told\n a lot of other relatives, this happens a lot in America\u2014not just with\n Mexicans or Central Americans, Blacks or whatever\u2014is a lot of people yell\n out racism or discrimination.\n      \n      \n Ben: And I sincerely believe that sometimes we discriminate ourselves,\n that we put it on ourselves, because we teach that to our children, because\n weekends we all want to go get together with other relatives, other friends\n of our own ethnicity. And that's not really what America's about and that's\n not what I taught my children because that's not how I lived my life. I was\n out with everybody, congregating with everybody, and that's the environment\n that we brought our children up in. We brought them up in their church\u2014I\n was talking to you earlier, our church and the school that they went to was\n part of the church. We were the only Hispanics.\n      \n      \n Ben: But that doesn't mean that we didn't allow them or try to get them\n to forget who they were. We didn't, because we brought them around our\n relatives, but we let them see that environment and so that they felt\n comfortable. So, when they got out into the world, they're comfortable\n around anybody and they're not looking at colors or whatever. And they\n don't feel like they're different and they don't feel different. I\n honestly, I think I felt more different when I got back here [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: Right.\n      \n      \n Ben: Because it was really kind of weird. But over there I didn't, but\n I think environment is one of the most important things. If you put a good\n person in a bad situation, in a bad environment, sooner or later he'll\n break. If you get a bad person that's never known what life is really\n supposed to be about, guide him a little bit and give him a little time,\n and if he's willing\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: It might work out.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah, it might work out.\n      \n      \n Anne: Interesting. So, you achieved your dreams in America.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: Do you have dreams now for yourself here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. My dream here is, one, to help here and I can't say it's a\n goal that's going to be met. And the other is I'm going to have here what I\n had over there and I'm confident that I can make that happen.\n      \n      \n Anne: And will you make it through construction business, or will you make\n it through\u2026?\n      \n      \n Ben: Right now, I think that there's other areas here that I could\n probably succeed in without jumping into the construction business. We have\n land back here (in the family home) and a buy little bit of cattle, make\n some money here. There\u2019s just several different ideas. But I know that I\n can excel in a job here, because there's several people here that are\n making some pretty high incomes and just, some pretty much as\n telemarketers, but just there's some call centers with some good bonuses.\n You're not going to get rich there, but you can make a good living.\n      \n      \n Anne: Right.\n      \n      \n Ben: But there's some opportunities right now.\n      \n      \n Anne: What do you think the Mexican government should be doing to better\n integrate return migrants?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well, I think that there should be a program where returning\n migrant\u2026Well, one, there should be at least some type of assistance, get\n them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of\n origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers\n to hire new arrivals.\n      \n      \n Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of\n assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in\n monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the\n things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take\n 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't\n have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they\n have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out\n of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're\n dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's\n shelters, but them shelters are full.\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: Them shelters can't possibly hold all them people, they can't. And\n so, all these people running around\u2014they're running around the monument\n right now\u2014laying there around. I see them laying around, the same people\n laying on the streets. But here in Mexico City, it's not that bad. You go\n to the border and the border cities where all along the Texas border, those\n are main dumping grounds for ICE [Immigration and Customs Enforcement]. All\n these border detentions that are on the border states, they're daily buses\n are driving and dumping people off. Detentions from up north, they wait\n until they fill up a plane, or planes, then they ship them. But here, they\n catch. It's every day they're dumping people. And there\u2019s gotta be\n something done about that. I think that there's assistance for just about\n any and everything else. I do think that it would be in the best interest\n of the government to assist deportees that are coming back. It would\n probably save them a lot of money\u2014it'd probably save them more to get them\n home and give them a little bit of cash, give them a bus ticket home to\n where they're from, and it would be a lot less expensive than all the chaos\n that's going on right now.\n      \n      \n Anne: Seems that the US also has really ignored the whole problem, the\n families that they're breaking up.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: You've thought about that, in terms of US policy, ways that they can\n eliminate the hardship that your family is going through because you're\n here?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Anne: I mean not just the financial, emotional but everything. And it seems\n like it\u2019s not even in the equation.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yes, that's true, that's not even in the equation. [Pause]. That's\n tough. But yes, I think [Pause] that [Pause] they're not looking at\n individual cases when looking at this immigration issue. I mean if they\n really, if the immigration person were really doing their job, then the\n judge did his job and really take the time to look at each individual case,\n some of these separations wouldn't happen. But they're not doing that, to\n me they're just trying to pile up numbers. I know many a case where\u2026Just an\n example, one gentleman, taking care of his family, has residency, he's a\n legal resident. One DWI and it's over with, he's gone.\n      \n      \n Anne: He's a legal resident?\n      \n      \n Ben: A legal resident. One DWI and that's it, he's gone. And I've known\n of others that had up to three and they're still there. I know some that\n have felonies and they're still there. Then one DWI, that's not being fair.\n The biggest injustice I think is going after all these Dreamers and using\n the information that they filled out on their DACA paperwork to go track\n them down. I agree that there has to be some type of people should be\n picked up, but they're not chasing those people. They're going for the easy\n numbers because, you know what? Those guys they don't have paperwork where\n they can go pick them up, they\u2019re not going to school here, going there.\n It's harder to catch them, so you know what? We can drum up 10-15,000\n people right here, beef our numbers up. We got the addresses, let's just go\n get them.\n      \n      \n Ben: And that's kind of what they're doing, not really doing their job.\n Just to say that \u201cWe're doing something.\u201d With 9/11, I remember that they,\n within the first few days, 20 something hundred arrests that they were\n attributing as terrorist arrests. But you know who they were picking up?\n They were picking up Mexicans most of them. It was not 20 something hundred\n Middle Easterners. But regardless, they were numbers. They had to show that\n they were doing something. But that's that [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Ben: The US, there's a lot that they could be doing, because they can\n deport 100,000, but they know they gotta replace those 100,000 for the\n workforce. One thing I know is I know the ins and outs of labor in the US.\n That is one thing that I do know. And I do know that there's unwritten\n policies that look the other way, look the other way while we get this\n done. We need this done, look the other way. Hurricane Katrina was one, we\n had immigration, immigration was about the only police patrolling the area\n at the time and they weren't bothering anybody\u2014it was hands off until they\n get this cleaned up. And once all the toxic clean-up was out of the way,\n then they started to enforce, but still not full force again.\n      \n      \n Ben: So, there's a lot to the government, part to blame there. Instead\n of locking them up, they should really create some type of labor program.\n      \n      \n Anne: People can come and go.\n      \n      \n Ben: People can come, instead of coming across and, to me, instead of\n somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could\n pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the\n US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do\n that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private\n business, they need to keep them costs down. It's like, would you like to\n pay $30 for a Big Mac? [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Anne: You\u2019re saying that McDonald's is just using a lot of undocumented and\n paying them really?\n      \n      \n Ben: Well the whole concept of migrant labor, the migrant labor force,\n is to keep the cost of products down and housing as well. If it wasn't for\n migrant labor and this underground labor networks that are operating, a\n $250,000 house would've probably cost you a million. And a lot of people\n wouldn't be able to, a lot of people can't afford a $200,000 house\n [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Anne: No. Well I thank you very much.\n      \n      \n Ben: Thank you all for coming, coming to help us out and spread the\n news.\n      \n      \n Anne: You\u2019ve probably been asked this question, but do you consider\n yourself an American? A Mexican?\n      \n      \n Ben: You know, honestly deep inside, American. That's how I've always\n felt. But right now, after this happened, it's like have you ever, there\n was a book called The Man with No Country, are you familiar with that?\n      \n      \n Anne: Yeah.\n      \n      \n Ben: That's, when I was deported, that's the first thing that, that's\n what came to my mind, The Man with No Country, not here, not there, not\n accepted here, not accepted over there. And when I got here it's like, no\n paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a\n driver's license, getting my voter registration\u2014which is the main source of\n ID here\u2014the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.\n And I was illegal in the United States and I was able to, anything I\n needed, I could get over there. And here, I'm here, I had a hard time. It\n took me a few months.\n      \n      \n Anne: It's really too bad.\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. Kind of rough. I don't know if it had been easier here, in\n the big city, but over there it was pretty rough, hard getting around.\n      \n      \n Anne: Well, I wish you the best of luck.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh, thank you\u2014\n      \n      \n Anne: I think that you're, you think you're going to be fine, so I think\n you're going to be fine. And you must be very proud of your family, they\n seem really great.\n      \n      \n Ben: Oh, I am, they're going, they're moving forward, that was the\n purpose of heading that way.\n      ",
