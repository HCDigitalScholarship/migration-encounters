    "text": "Sergio:        Okay. It's Sergio. I am here with Soner, starting the interview. Okay, Soner.\nSoner:        Hello.\nSergio:        Thank you for being here.\nSoner:        You're welcome.\nSergio:        Your stories are really important if we're going to be able to help people in your situation and hopefully shed more light about things that you go through to improve it.\nSoner:        All right.\nSergio:        Thank you.\nSoner:        You're welcome.\nSergio:        First, why did your family leave from Mexico to the U.S.?\nSoner:        Well, my mom started to move around. She went to, she left Juarez, still here in Mexico, and she began working in a tire factory. And then from that job, she got her visa and her passport, and she got me and my sister, the visa and passport, and we just moved to Atlanta to reunite with family members. Her sister, my uncle, my cousin. And we've been there for about nine, 10 years over there.\nSergio:        What age were you when you left?\nSoner:        I was eight-years-old when we left to the U.S. And just stayed there for those 10 years.\nSergio:        What did your family and what did you leave behind in Mexico when you left?\nSoner:        Well, me and my family, we left other loved ones. For example, my dad stayed here. My grandmother, my grandparents, all of them. We left the house. My mom had her own business, she had her barber shop. And she just try to make something better for us.\nSergio:        So she left behind a barbershop?\nSoner:        Yeah. She studied for like... Not a barbershop, a beauty salon. She studied that. She has been putting like nails, makeup, hairdos. She does all that. I try to be aware of what she's done for me and my sister.\nSergio:        What's your first memory of the U.S.?\nSoner:        My first memory of the U.S. is, what am I doing here? And why did my mom bring me somewhere far, far away from my family? That was my first impression, I would say.\nSergio:        Because you had to leave your friends.\nSoner:        Yeah. My friends, my school, my teachers. And then just moving to another place and starting from zero, from scrap, that was a pretty difficult transition.\nSergio:        How did you feel? Did you feel mad?\nSoner:        No, not mad. I felt more of a... How would you say? I felt more of a uncertainty, because I didn't know why we moved. I just knew I had to follow my mom. I didn't know the country, the language. And that was kind of like a setback for me. Because I mean, I left school and everything I had behind.\nSergio:        When you were there and you started school, what was that transition like?\nSoner:        When I started school, that transition was a bit difficult because first of all, I didn't know the country and the customs that they had over there. For example, over here in Mexico, you do the pledge to the flag every Monday. And over there, you do it every morning. So that was kind of different. Adapting to the food, the environment, everything like that was a bit difficult. But I mean, since I was a kid, I tried to adapt to overcome. And that's what helped me out with that.\nSergio:        Do you remember the pledge?\nSoner:        I think it's, \u201cI pledge allegiance to the flag of the United States of America and to the Republic for which it stands, one nation under God, indivisible, with liberty and justice for all.\u201d Yeah, I do remember the pledge. The anthem, I couldn't learn it. I also forgot the anthem from down here in Mexico as well. So yeah, that was kind of like a big, like something that really kept me laid back a little bit.\nSergio:        What do you mean by that?\nSoner:        For example, getting over there and learning new things, and then not forgetting, but trying to stay with the things that I had learned from Mexico, it was kind of hard, because I had to learn new things. I thought I was going to stay there for probably my whole life. But then, well, for family emergency, we had to come back. Me and my mom and my sister. And well we've been here ever since.\nSergio:        Did you feel like that pledge applies to you?\nSoner:        Well, the pledge, like specifically, it didn't apply to me. I felt like I was just saying it to not disrespect the country that I was living in. But I didn't feel it as my own. Because I was born in Mexico and going to another country, that was kind of difficult.\nSergio:        Did you ever feel like it was your country? Did you ever feel comfortable?\nSoner:        I felt comfortable, but I never felt like it was my country. Because I did suffer from not racism, but exclusion from certain people, especially Anglos. They did try to keep you down, but I've never let that keep me... Held me back or anything like that.\nSergio:        So you went in when you were eight already.\nSoner:        Yes.\nSergio:        It must've been a harder transition. Were you ever bullied?\nSoner:        No, I wasn't bullied. Because I've always had a hard temper even when I was a child. I've never experienced any bullying because I tried to get integrated with a bilingual group, with mostly Spanish speaking group. And I mean, they also helped me how to understand the language, how to be more accustomed to it, and how to learn their traditions, their mannerisms and whatnot.\nSergio:        Did you, growing up, always feel like an outsider?\nSoner:        Well, I didn't feel like an outsider. It just felt out of place. I didn't feel like I was... I mean, there was a lot of people that made me feel welcome, but a lot of people that... Not just to me, but to other individuals that I knew that were held back sometimes. For example, from jobs in school. In the community, I felt that. But no, I did not feel like out of place or anything like that. I just felt like I just needed to adapt to that environment.\nSergio:        By the time you left, did you feel like you adapted better?\nSoner:        By the time I left, I tried to not forget what I had learned and I tried to implement that when I got here, like to not be bullied or not to be discriminated for being raised over here or for knowing another language. It was kind of hard because, for example, over here in school, they teach you English as a second language. And I tried to not stand out because I truly, I don't feel like I should stand out because I don't like that attention on me. For example, the teacher would always say, \"Well, [inaudible 00:10:17] or Soner would know the answer because he knows the language.\" And how I would just try to just sit all the way in the back of the class. Be like, \"No, I don't know.\"\nSergio:        Did you?\nSoner:        Yeah, I did. Yeah. And in the States I learned that I try to do that because some other students or fellow students that were with me in elementary and middle school, they were more of a teacher\u2019s pet. And I was like, \"No, I'm not going to become that. I'm going to try to just lay back all the way in the back. Just try to not draw attention to myself.\"\nSergio:        In school, when that would happen, would that be in the U.S. or in Mexico when they would call on you for the answer?\nSoner:        When I came back to Mexico, that was right here. In the U.S., I try to also lay back, not draw too much attention to myself. For example, I like math. I'm pretty good at math. And I tried, for example, I used to try to not ace every test because I was going to be thinking... I thought to myself that I was going to become that teacher's pet. And I didn't want that attention on me. I just wanted to get by school, not drawing any attention towards me.\nSergio:        So when you went... Before you left the U.S., when you were kind of going through your years, what did you want to do in the U.S. after graduation? After all of that?\nSoner:        When I was in the U.S., I was mostly drawn to art. There was a guidance counselor in my middle school that noticed that I liked drawing. And she signed me up for a special program for art. And I started doing that. It was an afterschool program, so I took advantage of that. I tried to do as much as, like improve my art, for example, my drawing. I know how to mold with clay. I know how to paint. And those skills were like, have been reminiscent with me, because throughout the years I've been trying to develop my tattoo skills, my graffiti skills. I've been doing that, not recently, but throughout my adolescence and my adulthood before I had children.\nSergio:        So you wanted to be an artist?\nSoner:        Yeah, I wanted to be an artist.\nSergio:        When did you find out that you were coming back?\nSoner:        I found out that I was coming back when I was in summer vacation, because my mom received the... Well, she didn't receive, she called to check on her mom and my grandmother didn't answer. And she always, usually she always answered her phone. And this time a cousin that was living next to her, answered the phone and explained everything to my mom. That my grandmother was... That she suffered a stroke and that she was in the hospital. And my mom, she felt like that she needed to come back. And at the time she told her sister, my aunt, that she was going to come back, but she needed us to stay over there.\nSoner:        And I mean, first of all, me and my sister, we've been close to my mom since day one. I mean, my sister, she mostly lived her life over there because we took her over six months. Her life was over there. But I told my mom that if she was going to come back, I had to come back with her, because I couldn't stay knowing that my mom would be down here and I would be over there. We would be apart. And then my sister followed me. She's been close to my mom ever since she was little, and that's why we try to stay all together and come back all together.\nSergio:        And you all came back.\nSoner:        And we all came back.\nSergio:        You came back for your family members?\nSoner:        What was that?\nSergio:        You all came back for one of your family members?\nSoner:        Yes. For my grandmother who had the stroke. When we got here, she was still hospitalized and she was kind of in a coma for a few months. And when she came back to her senses, the doctor told us that she had a partial paralysis on her left side. So my mom knew that she couldn't go back right away because she had to take care of her mom. And we stayed down here. We took care of my grandmother until she got better. She got a lot better. She fully recovered from her side paralysis. And then my mom was just starting to go ahead and get her beauty salon back on track. Because she left it, but it wasn't closed or shut down. She just left it under somebody else's care, a family friend. And when my mom came back, she started to retake that.\nSergio:        After 10 years of being away, what was it like being back?\nSoner:        Well, it was difficult. Mostly the food, it was totally different over there. There it was mostly like take-out burgers, In-N-Out. And over here it's more home cooked meals. For example, like not fried chicken, but chicken soup, rice, there's different types of... How do you say it? It's called, not just one type of foods, for example, like burgers or fries, soft drinks. Over here is more like organic or more home cooked.\nSergio:        And was that better for you or were you just used to the other food?\nSoner:        That wasn't better for me. It did kind of throw me off, because first of all, I was getting used to the fast foods and all that. And then just coming back here and start eating home cooked meals was kind of like a setback because I was like, \"Hey, I want to go to Burger King, McDonald's, Carl's Jr.\" And also like money-wise it wasn't like my mom had the money to spend that money for us to go to different restaurants or anything like that. Like back in the States.\nSergio:        It was different.\nSoner:        Yeah.\nSergio:        She did not have as much money as before.\nSoner:        Yeah, exactly.\nSergio:        So where did you live in the U.S.?\nSoner:        I lived in the U.S. in Atlanta, Georgia.\nSergio:        And then here?\nSoner:        And here-\nSergio:        ... When you came back.\nSoner:        When we came back, first, I'm originally from Acapulco. So we went back to Acapulco. I was there until three years ago, when I came to Mexico City just to try something new. Because right now, the justice system in Acapulco is like all the way... It's the worst place to live right now since I've looked in the news, because of all the murders, like political, it's like political people that are just corruption. And not just from political, but from the law. And that was a setback. And I tried to get away from that because a lot of people were like that I knew back in Acapulco, they were getting kidnapped. They were getting beat down or incarcerated for being at the wrong place at the wrong time.\nSoner:        And I told my mom, I was like, \"You know what, I'm trying to go to Mexico City. I'm going to try to work over there, see how things are.\" And that's when I came over here and just started working in a call center. I liked the environment. It's bilingual. I keep on working on improving my language skills, my grammar, my writing skills. And I mean, I like it.\nSergio:        Aside from the food, was the transition from the U.S. life to Mexican life hard?\nSoner:        Yes, it was hard. Also, because as I mentioned to you before, the money-wise. For example, when we were in Atlanta, it was every weekend, go out to eat. I don't know, go to the park, go to the movies. And when we came back, it was kind of a... We deprived ourselves from certain privileges. For example, back in the States, you could purchase some tennis shoes or some clothes, like every two weeks, three weeks. Right here, because of money-wise, you have to work hard, just wait for that paycheck to come good, so you can buy stuff for yourself, for your family members, for your loved ones. And it's kind of hard in that part.\nSergio:        So you've been back eight years?\nSoner:        Around eight, nine years.\nSergio:        And you started a family here?\nSoner:        What was that?\nSergio:        You started a family?\nSoner:        Yes. I have started a family here. I have two kids. One is seven-years-old, about to be eight in August. And I have a newborn. He was born in November. He's about to be seven months on the 23rd of this month. And I'm trying to provide for them right now.\nSergio:        Would you ever want to go back?\nSoner:        Yes, I would like to go back. But not to stay, like to visit. I feel like I don't want to put my family... Right now, I don't want to put my family, the one I've started, through that change that my mom made me go through when I was small. For example, a new country, new customs, new backgrounds, new everything. I try to speak with my kids in English, so they would learn and not be setback in that. If they do want to go ahead and sign up for a foreign exchange student program or anything like that, I mean, they would be prepared with that knowledge base of that language, so they can better communicate or translate or anything like that.\nSergio:        What do you hope to accomplish now that you're back here?\nSoner:        Right now, what I want to accomplish is to first get enough money to... Well, get a visa or a passport for me and my kids and my wife to visit, I don't know, maybe Disneyland. Right now, my main goal is to... There's this program here in Mexico called Infonavid, which is for, to buy a house. I'm trying to look into that. I want to have that background that I do have something to return, because that's what they told me that if you want to apply for a visa or anything like that, they have to see that you have something to come back to. And I do want to come back to my house over here. I just don't want to buy it and just leave it standing there. I want to buy it and be living in it for maybe the rest of my life, and leave it to my kids and their kids and their grandkids.\nSergio:        Do you have any other things you wanted to say before we finish the interview?\nSoner:        What was that?\nSergio:        Do you have any other things you want to say before we finish the interview?\nSoner:        No, that would be all. I mean, is there anything else that you want to ask me?\nSergio:        I guess, what would you say to someone that's thinking about going to the U.S.?\nSoner:        Someone that's thinking of going to the U.S. If they're going to go to the U.S., try to do it the legal way, not trying to cross the borders. Because I've seen the news, and I mean, they're crossing the borders with children, babies, and I mean, they get stuck on the desert or rocky places. And sometimes they lose their lives. And that's not something to put your lives before just to go to what they call the American dream. Something that you can also do here, if you set your mind to it. The American dream is just, in my opinion, is just something that we strive for, but we don't know that we actually have that here, if we work for it. Putting the work to it, working, working, working, and try to avoid any like bad company, like addictions and whatnot. That would be my response to somebody that wants to go over there.\nSergio:        Thank you so much for your time.\nSoner:        Mm-hmm.",
