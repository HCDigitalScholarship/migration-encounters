  "text":"Sergio: Did you qualify for DACA?\n \n \n   Josue: I don't know. I think that I could have because I did all of my high\n   school there and college as well. But I never really looked into it. And\n   what's funny is before I actually came to Mexico, about a year before, I\n   called my mom and I told her that I wanted to come back. So like nine\n   months after that, that's when I got caught. So first I had bail, and then\n   whenever I had my meeting with a judge, like my hearing, she asked\n   me\u2014'cause I was like the only one in the room that they didn't need a\n   translator\u2014she was like, \u201cAre you sure you don't want to fight your case?\u201d\n \n \n   Josue: But there were so many people there that I knew, maybe they were in\n   my situation where they could have qualified, but they had been there for\n   years, or you know like a year or something. I didn't think it was worth\n   it. So I signed my voluntary departure.\n \n \n  "
