  "text":"Anne: You go back to Mexico and you got to college. Was it hard making that\n   transition?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes, it was. The thing is, since I knew I was going to come back I\n   was determined to go back to college. Before I came back, I made sure that\n   I went to the state\u2019s\u2014I got my high school diploma stamped by the state, by\n   the Provo School District. I got a stamp, I got all my papers before I came\n   back so that made it a lot easier for me. Because I know people who come\n   back and want to go to college, but they can't because they didn't do what\n   they had to do before they came back and then they just give up.\n \n \n   Juan: They're like, \"It's going to be so hard to get that, so I just don't\n   want to do it.\" I thought of my future and I was like, \"No, I've got to get\n   this done,\" so I got it done. I came back, I put in my process of getting\n   my high school diploma and all my years over there of studies renewed. Or\n   how do you say it? Validated.\n \n \n   Anne: Validated.\n \n \n   Juan: Get it validated, and it did take six months but I got the answer\n   back. Everything is good and I was able to go back to college. At the\n   beginning it was hard, because obviously everything was in Spanish, and my\n   Spanish wasn't that good in reading or speaking or even writing. It wasn't\n   perfect, but I did manage to do my best, and at the moment, from the six\n   semesters that I've been in college right now, I've only failed one class.\n   That was in my first semester and it was history.\n \n \n   Juan: Because, again, going back to the Spanish, it wasn't so good, that I\n   wasn't able to pass the class. But now my Spanish is a lot better and,\n   right now, I don't think I'm going to fail any classes because I'm set. In\n   the beginning it was hard adapting to the classmates, to the culture and\n   stuff like that, but I'm managing right now. I'm halfway through my career,\n   I'm looking into different projects, like I mentioned, the Airbnb. I'm\n   looking to finishing my career strong and start my quest as an\n   entrepreneur.\n \n \n  "
