  "text":"I was working in a call center at\n   that time and mostly for returnees, it's mostly that. Work in a call center\n   and that's it. You're good. But to be honest, it's pretty horrible. It\n   sucks working in one of those places because you're basically one of those,\n   they call them pochos, you're basically one of those kids that, it's not\n   Mexican, it's not a U.S. citizen. So, you're kind of in the middle and no\n   one kind of knows how to treat you. So it's weird. And I was just down\n   there smoking, thinking, \"Hey, is this going to be my whole life? Am I\n   going to keep working in this kind of stuff?\"\n \n \n  "
