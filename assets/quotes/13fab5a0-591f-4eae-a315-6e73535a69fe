  "text":"I think it's because they had the picture of us all twisted, you\n   know? We've made bad decisions, but we ain't bad people. We're not trash.\n   We're nothing like that. I have values. I know how it is to live. I know\n   what's the right way. How you are supposed to do it. And family is the main\n   thing. At least to me.\n \n \n   Anne: And that's your dream?\n \n \n   Hugo: Yes. I still think of all that. I mean, right now, my parents\n   probably be helped out with... My little brother's growing up, but we can\n   help out too. Because my dad, he has diabetes. My mom does too. And my\n   mom's one of them holy ladies that, \u201cJesus Christ, I have nothing, Jesus\n   Christ will heal me.\u201d I'm like, \"Yes, Jesus Christ will heal you, but take\n   your medicine, take care of yourself.\" She was just in the hospital a month\n   ago, in and out, and I kept telling her, \"Man, I believe your religion,\n   Mother, pray to your Jesus, but take care of yourself too.\"\n \n \n  "
