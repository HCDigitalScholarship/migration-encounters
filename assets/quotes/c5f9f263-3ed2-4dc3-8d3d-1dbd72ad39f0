And, of course, these people start paying\n   me more money because they were rich people. Because Palm Springs is in\n   summer it's so hot, they go away for three, four months. So I take care of\n   their residence. And I mean, United States for me, was very good. Very good\n   because I always was welcome. Always have a job.\n \n \n  "
