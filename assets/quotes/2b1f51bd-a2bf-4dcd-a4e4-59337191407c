  "text":"I'm pretty sure the call centers are doing their best to help us out, but I\n     don't know. It is very difficult. You're actually waiting to see what's\n     going to happen. Every time you go to a call center, you wait to see what's\n     going to happen next. Okay, I'm here right now. This is a good account. I'm\n     getting my money, but what if it moves? For us it's difficult because, as\n     being in this business, I think it is a business, I got to invest my time\n     and I\u2019ve got to save money because I don't know what's going to happen\n     next. That's why I've been in so many call centers here.\n \n \n    "
