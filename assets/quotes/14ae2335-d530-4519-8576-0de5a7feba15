  "text":"d he's going to come back?\n      \n      \n Billy: And he's going to come back and supposedly, they're going to be\n together when he comes back. They're going to reunite. My dad told me, and\n he told me this in secret, he was like, \"Look man, the reason why I'm doing\n this is because right now this woman is helping me out.\" She bought him a\n car. I swear to god. This is so weird, bro. She literally went to the car\n dealership, not even in payments, bro, just bought a car. $30,000 and just\n gave it to my dad.\n      \n      \n Anita: She was that wealthy.\n      \n      \n Billy: She was a millionaire.\n      \n      \n Anita: Really?\n      \n      \n Billy: Yeah, her husband, his name was Jack. Died of alcoholism but he was\n very wealthy. He died and left her, bro, left her so much property, so much\n money, so many things. And she ended up falling in love with my dad because\n of the music. And when my dad got in a car crash\u2014I forgot to tell you\n this\u2014that's the reason she bought the car was so he could go to work. And\n so, she's a nice lady, bro. She's not mean at all, dude. She saw, \"Okay\n this guy has a family to support. Can't get to work. I'm going to buy him a\n car. Okay, this guy right now doesn't have anywhere to go, he can stay at\n my place.\" So super nice lady and I don't have anything against her. It was\n just... it was my dad. He was inconsiderate. But he's not a bad guy. How is\n he a bad guy when he's been supporting two families for 18 years? He's the\n nicest guy ever.\n      \n      \n A"
