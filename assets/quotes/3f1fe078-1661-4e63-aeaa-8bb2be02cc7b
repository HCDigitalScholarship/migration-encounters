  "text":"Olimpya: Yeah. It's our birthday. [Laughs]. So, we were born on the same\n   day, and we didn't know it. We were just like, \"Huh.\" But she used to take\n   care of me a lot. If she would see me doing nothing, she was like, \"Oh,\n   come here. I'll teach you something.\" So she would pull me a lot to\n   everywhere. If it was vacationsand I was at home alone\u2014because my brothers\n   were already old, and they're guys, so they're doing their thing\u2014she would\n   be like, \"Hey, come to my house. Stay here for the vacations,\" and I would\n   go with her. She's a Christian, and they got a lot of activities on\n   vacations like Bible school, this, and that, so I used to love going over\n   there. She started pulling me and pulling me until one day she told my mom,\n   \"Hey, she's growing up. She needs to have somebody that takes care of her\n   24/7. You work a lot. Let her live with us. She's your kid. You can see\n   whenever you want, but let her live with us. We'll give her everything that\n   you can't give her at the moment.\"\n \n \n  "
