  "text":"Coming to a place where\n   [Chuckles] the third week that we came to live here, there was a car shot\n   down, completely, and two people killed like right outside my house. That\n   was really scary [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Lizzy: Did you see it happen or hear it happen?\n \n \n   Laila: I heard the gunshots, and when I looked out of my window I just saw\n   two motorcycles leaving at a high speed. When a lot of the neighbors went\n   to the car to see what happened and to see if they could help anybody,\n   there was two kids dead there. They were probably between fifteen to\n   seventeen-years-old. They were pretty young and they were shot down\n   completely there.\n \n \n   Lizzy: This was soon after you got back?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So they were about your age?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, they were about my age and it was really scary seeing that,\n   when in the States you mostly don't see the violence first-hand. You may\n   hear about it and all that, but where I live it's constantly. A couple of\n   months ago, somebody also got killed like a block away from my house. You\n   just hear the gunshots and you just completely freeze. It's really hard.\n \n \n   Lizzy: How much of the time would you say that you're in fear? Like every\n   day? Every week?\n \n \n   Laila: Every day, every day. Especially now with a lot of women getting\n   targeted in where I live\u2014around I live, there are a lot of missing people\n   posters you could say, and they're all from ten to fifteen-years-old.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Wow.\n \n \n   Laila: And they're all little girls. It's really hard, and it's scary being\n   a woman here in Mexico, it's really scary. My mom always says if you're\n   going to go out, be back before the sun is down. If you need help, I don't\n   know, get a taxi or get help or I don't know, just run, she says. Don't\n   freeze because the worst thing you could do is freeze. I don't know, it's\n   really scary when your parents have to tell you that before you go out and\n   have them constantly calling you like, \"Are you okay? Is everything okay?\"\n   It's really hard. It's really hard.\n \n \n  "
