What's so wrong about this?\n   That you put us through all this stuff that we have nothing over there?\"\n   And then I realized when I came over here\u2014I actually cried, because I'm\n   like, \"Damn, she did all that for us to have a better life.\"\n \n \n   Mike: And it hit me in the face. I was like, \"Damn, my mom went through a\n   lot of sacrifices and it sucks.\" I was embarrassed because I'm like, \"Damn,\n   I didn't do anything. I didn't do anything with the blessings that I got.\"\n   I felt bad. But in a way I feel like everything is for a reason.\n \n \n  "
