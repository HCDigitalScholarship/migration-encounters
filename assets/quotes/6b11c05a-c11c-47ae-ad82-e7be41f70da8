  "text":"Erik: I like to live out the country, besides the big city like this one.\n   Go to the lake, fishing, hunting, or you know? Or, like right now, I got a\n   big backpack cause I got to swim and then go to jog. But I got to do it in\n   the gym. Right there, I can go to the lake or go and jog in the woods.\n   That's what I like. So is basically what I miss. You know?\n \n \n  "
