  "text":"Anita: I want to hear, first of all, why you migrated? Why did you go to\n   the states? How old were you?\n \n \n   Ruben: 5 or 4. We migrated because of the money situation that we had. We\n   had what I remember as a pretty low income. My dad couldn't keep a stable\n   job. He would actually work in the mornings and in the afternoons he would\n   be fixing neighbors cars, their toilet, their shower head, their sinks,\n   paint houses, but it wasn't enough. So we didn't actually come together.\n   They came to the United States, were there for nine months, saved up some\n   money, and then they came back and got me and my sister. They went over\n   there, worked, saved money, and then they came back for us and that's when\n   we landed on 59th and Vermont.\n \n \n  "
