  "text":"Tim: Besides school when you came back, was it hard to like reintegrate\n   yourself in Mexican culture after living in the US first for long?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into\n   myself. Because specifically in high school, I started... there's Spanish\n   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're\n   like, \"y tienes carnales?\u201d \" And I'm like, \"carnales, what's that?\" \"si\n   tienes hermanos?\u201d And I'm like, \"Oh yeah, I have two brothers.\" Oh, okay.\n   And they would use those words, no?\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So, I started like learning them. \u201cOh yeah. carnal significa\n   [carnal means] brother.\u201d What other words did they use? They would use\n   expressions like, \u201cay ese hombre es un Don Juan,\u201d [that man is a Don Juan]\n   and I'm like, \"Who's Don Juan?\" And they're like, \"Oh no. It just means\n   that he's a player,\" and words like that. So I was like, \"Oh, okay. This is\n   like pretty weird, but I like it. It's cool.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So when I was in high school, this kid, he was like the most\u2014I\n   don't know, he was very hyperactive, but he was cool. He's like, \"Hey\n   Jeimmy,\" because everybody was like in break, \"Hey Jeimmy.\" I'm like,\n   \u201cque?\u201d He's like, \"ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre,\" [did you manage to ring\n   the doorbell] and I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" He's like, \"Yeah, Jeimmy,\n   ya alcanzas a tocar el timbre?\" and everybody's laughing, and I'm like, \u201cI\n   don't know what you're talking about.\"\n \n \n   Jeimmy: \"Si Jeimmy si ya tocas el timbre, el timbre de tu casa?.\" [have you\n   rung the doorbell of your house] And I'm like, \"mi casa no tiene timbre.\u201d\n   [my house doesn\u2019t have a doorbell] So everybody just starts laughing at me,\n   and I'm like, \"Oh my God, what did I say?\" So later on, I tell my friend,\n   I'm like, \"What did he mean?\" And she's laughing at me and she can't stop\n   laughing at me. And then she's like, \"Okay, he basically asked you if\n   you've already had sex. But your response was, my house doesn't have a\n   doorbell. So, it's pretty funny.\" And I was like, \u201cOh, okay.\u201d\n \n \n   Jeimmy: So yeah, you start learning all these expressions, all these some\n   double centered words. And I mean it took me a while to learn it.\n \n \n  "
