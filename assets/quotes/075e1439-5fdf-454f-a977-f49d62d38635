  "text":"Mike: And I wish I had that energy in high school, but I don't know what\n   happened. I just lost that. They took everything out of me. But yeah, when\n   you get that motivation, I feel like anything is possible, because I\n   learned how to draw, and I learned how to talk to people. There's a\n   language barrier that's really, really hard. If you don't know English, you\n   don't fit in.\n \n \n  "
