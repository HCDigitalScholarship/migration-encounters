  "text":"Donovan: I'm always the one doing some type of movement. In middle school\n   and high school, even in the gangs, dealing drugs, I've always been, even\n   in every single job, I've always been to be like the people who they look\n   for. In the class they say something that's not proper to us, and everybody\n   looks at me because I'm the first one to say something. It's really cool to\n   be like that, but you have to use it for something good.\n \n \n  "
