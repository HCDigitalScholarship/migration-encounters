  "text":"Dan: Well, I remember when I was at my former job as a customer service\n   agent, I feel so proud due to the fact that I was sitting next to college\n   students that studied so many years in college and I was earning more than\n   them because of a language difference and a shift differential. I was like,\n   I didn't have to study that much and I'm earning more. I guess it was one\n   of the satisfactions, but obviously, you have to work for it.\n \n \n  "
