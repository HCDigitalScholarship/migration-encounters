  "text":"When I was really young, I had gotten accident that required surgery\n   and I needed to get that surgery done, so when I went to the hospital and\n   get it done there was actually a couple of people from a criminal\n   organization that were supposed to, I guess, kill somebody in there. I\n   remember this like it was yesterday. I had a little breathing mask on and\n   the doctor was telling me to breathe when he counted the eight, I could\n   just hear the gunshots.\n \n \n  "
