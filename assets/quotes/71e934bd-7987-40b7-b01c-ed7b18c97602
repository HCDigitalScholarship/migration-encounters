  "text":"Erik: You're right but getting one point of a good therapy is just tell you\n   have to take your own decisions, man. I just don't understand your feet on\n   the ground, man. I mean, cheer up. You got to take your own decisions.\n   That's basically what a therapist would tell you. You need to make your own\n   decisions. So, there's not much I can do. That's why I don't see much hope\n   in the therapy, you know?\n \n \n  "
