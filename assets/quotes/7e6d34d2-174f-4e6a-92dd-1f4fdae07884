  "text":"Claudia: Right. And do you remember your first day in the United States?\n \n \n   Ilse: Definitely! [Laughs]. You see, I was very angry from the time my mom\n   told me that we had to leave Mexico. I was happy in Mexico. I have a lot of\n   friends. I mean, I was only nine, but when you're nine, especially I think\n   prior to this generation, you're very aware; at least, my mom always made\n   me like that. She'd educated me to always be independent, and to always\n   work hard at everything that I did. Obviously, at that time, I only went to\n   school, right? But I also sold candy outside of my house so I could help my\n   mom out a little bit, and I did so well in school, you know? I was so\n   happy. I actually got a scholarship being in Mexico so I could keep going\n   to school. I had straight A's. You know?\n \n \n   Ilse: And just out of nowhere, my mom coming up to me and saying, \"You're\n   going to have to leave everything behind because we're going to go see your\n   dad,\" that was just so shocking for me. And then, the whole journey to get\n   to the US, which I'll never forget, and it's... I really pray that no\n   nine-year-old ever has to go through that type of stuff. And then, getting\n   to the US and not knowing anyone, and feeling totally out of place, and\n   that first day was just so awful for me.\n \n \n  "
