  "text":"Axel: I just wish my kids would tell me. I want them to have that\n confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to\n have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in\n the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be\n safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,\n go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see\n me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that\n stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All\n right.\n      \n      \n Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but\n at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to\n help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be\n able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm\n not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's\n why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that\n they could say, \"Hey, your dad's never there.\" He's like, \"No, but he's\n always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him\n emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me\n that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in\n my life important.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my\n wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't\n have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from\n here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We\n weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just\n felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were\n going to grow up and be like, \"Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did\n everything. He's the one that get the money.\" She's like, \"I want to feel\n like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own\n heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I was like, \"Yeah, you don't have to say that it's my part or\n anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own\n stuff.\" She's like, \"No, but I just still feel like it's difficult.\" So\n right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix\n things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,\n and I understand my mom too at the same time like, \"Hey, you don't want to\n go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do\n you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.\"\n      \n      \n"
