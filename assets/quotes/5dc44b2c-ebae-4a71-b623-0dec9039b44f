  "text":"Axel: It's annoying sometimes, because sometimes even because of that,\n within the two blocks, they could search you about two, maybe three times.\n Because one guy will search you on the bikes, the guys on the bikes, then\n you're okay, they'll search you, they'll let you go. About another block\n later, you'll bump into guys that are just walking around and they'll\n search you too. Another block later, the guys in the cars, the trucks are\n going by, they'll stop in front. \"Hey, let me do a quick search, just\n random.\"\n      \n      \n"
