  "text":"Ivan: Okay. So I was 13 years old when I first got to the United States. At\n   that time, my mom was already in the United States. She'd been living in\n   the United States for about two years by then. And the circumstances why we\n   moved to the States, just seeking better opportunities because by that\n   time, we didn't have like a lot, what would you say that ... Here in\n   Mexico, we didn't have a stable life. We didn't even have the needs, we\n   didn't even have a house. So my mom moved to the States and after two\n   years, she brought us to the States. When I first got to the States, it was\n   a whole new thing, different language, different people, different culture.\n   And not just one culture, it was a mixture. You don't only have people from\n   one region, it's like a lot of races, if I can put it that way.\n \n"
