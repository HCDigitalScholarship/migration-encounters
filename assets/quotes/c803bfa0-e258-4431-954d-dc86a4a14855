  "text":"Jose: No, actually, I had a verbal offense with an officer, which I fought,\n   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also\n   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration\n   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.\n   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, \"Oh, they paid your bail.\n   You're good.\" I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was\n   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that\n   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at\n   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about\n   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got\n   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My\n   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.\n   And we're fine. They're like, \"Oh, we'll just see you at the county jail.\n   It'll be fine.\" But we were dead wrong.\n \n \n  "
