  "text":"They received a lot of discrimination at various\n   parts. We actually, my mom actually, got into a physical fight with a woman\n   at a store because she called her a dirty immigrant and wetback. My mom\n   physically got into a fight with her, and she was an employee of the store,\n   and it wasn't even called for.\n \n \n   Lizzy: The woman that said that to your mom was an employee?\n \n \n   Laila: Yes. Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: Were you there when this happened?\n \n \n   Laila: Yes, I was [Chuckles]. I remember everything she was saying, and my\n   mom was not speaking English, she didn't know what she was saying, and she\n   looked at me and I didn't want to tell her. I was so embarrassed for my\n   mom, for myself, and for everybody there just staring at her and listening\n   to all of the things that she was saying [Emotional]. I just froze,\n   completely. This person kind of knew Spanish, so she insulted my mom in\n   Spanish and my mom absolutely understood that at the first moment. She told\n   her, \"You don't need to treat people like this because you work here. It's\n   your job to help people that come here. You don't have to insult them.\" And\n   this person, she didn't care at all. So, she kept on insulting her and my\n   mom just got completely mad and they went into a physical fight. Both of\n   them. The lady didn't care, she hit my mom, and my mom hit her and it was\n   chaos. And then we got kicked out and they told us that they were going to\n   call the cops and that they were going to call ICE [Immigration and Custom\n   Enforcement] or whatever.\n \n \n   Lizzy: They threatened to call ICE on you?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah, so we had to leave. Later we knew that if they would have\n   called the cops, we could have probably fought back, legally because they\n   can't physically hit my mom if they're an employee. We were just scared,\n   they scared us out of doing anything by telling us that they were going to\n   call ICE.\n \n \n  "
