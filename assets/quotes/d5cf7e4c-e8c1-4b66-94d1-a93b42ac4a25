  "text":"Juan: Basically, it was a very hard decision. I came back by myself. It\n   basically was because when the president that is at the White House right\n   now, he changed the rules and everything. He made a task of making people\n   leave or getting deported and all that. And he started tightening all the\n   rules and the laws. And I'm living in the state of Texas, and Texas\n   participated a lot with that policy. And the police department was\n   cooperating with them, meaning that if you had a traffic ticket you could\n   get arrested and taken to immigration, to process your deportation.\n \n \n   Juan: The decision to come back was very hard and very difficult because I\n   was leaving my wife and my children behind. My home, my cars, and\n   practically all my belongings, I left them behind. But I'd rather have that\n   happening, than being arrested and maybe put in jail because I heard that\n   they're putting people in jail and they keep you there for a long time. And\n   I didn't want to go over that and be in jail for something like that. So I\n   decided just to come back and bring my clothes and as much as I could. But\n   it was a very difficult decision to come back and leave my family behind.\n \n \n  "
