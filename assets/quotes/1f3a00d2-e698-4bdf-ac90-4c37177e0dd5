  "text":"Noe: Yeah. For real. I feel like it's taking the manners from you. What\n   else? Kindness. The people ask you for money and everything. They're just\n   crazy. There's a guy in good working condition, just like, \u201cHey, give me\n   some money.\u201d Get out of my face, get the fuck out of my face, because I\n   can't stand those people. In good, working condition, they can have a job.\n   I got this in my mind, if you in that condition, a homeless condition, it\u2019s\n   because you wanted to. You have two hands, two feet, I don't see that you\n   suffer sickness or something like that, that will not allow you to work or\n   to have a job. There's a lot of work around here. There's work everywhere.\n   You just have to want to work first. That makes me mad a lot. Get out of\n   here, get out of my face, because I can't stand them. I can't stand the\n   people. I can\u2019t stand that.\n \n \n  "
