  "text":"So,\n   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest\n   itself?\n \n \n   Jesus: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so\n   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural\n   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't\n   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people\n   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are\n   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're\n   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a\n   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to\n   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you\n   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was\n   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?\" So, a little bit of jealousy\n   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever\n   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was\n   like, \"Why are you talking to her?\"\n \n \n  "
