  "text":"Anne: How does it compare--the food here to US?\n      \n      \n Axel: I stopped eating all that fast food. In the US, it was nothing but\n Burger King, McDonald's, Taco Bell. Just nothing but fast food. I think the\n only healthy... If you consider it healthy food that I would eat over there\n would be Chinese food, Chinese restaurants. Over here, it's all mainly, not\n homemade, but it's handmade. Our restaurants too, fast foods, they have\n their little machines and everything but over here it's like, you go and\n you buy some tacos, they're cooking it right there in front of you. They\n cut it open and cook it in front of you, they do everything right there in\n front of you. And in the States, you go to fast food, it's like, \"Okay,\n I'll order this.\" \"Okay, don't worry, we'll call you in a minute and you'll\n have your order ready.\"\n      \n      \n"
