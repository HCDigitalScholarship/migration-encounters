  "text":"Rocio: Of course, I went to see a lot of lawyers. They took all my money,\n   thousand dollars every time. Everybody telling me they going to help me to\n   go back. And of course until I say okay, no more paying to lawyers or\n   anything. And I met Yolanda Verona, the one who wants to create more\n   DREAMer moms, by Facebook and she asked me to represent moms here in\n   Mexico. And I said, \u201cOkay, but I just opened a Facebook page and everybody\n   are in United States.\u201d So, I was like, \u201cNo, I need to meet people here.\u201d\n   But in Mexico, I haven't met anybody, just one, Ana Laura Lopez, and she's\n   helping a lot people that came here\u2014she waits for them in the airport and\n   help them if they don't have place to stay or a job, or anything. But she\n   lives so far from me, so we met once but we can't even talk, you know to do\n   something together yet.\n \n \n  "
