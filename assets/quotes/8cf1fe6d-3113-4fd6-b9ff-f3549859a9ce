  "text":"Juan: The Mexican government don't care, don't help on anything, to the\n   citizens. The Mexican government, they just think of filling up their\n   pockets. That's all they care about. Versus the United States, you're\n   allowed to ... And that's why they call it the American dream, because\n   you're allowed to do as much as you want, as much as you can. And I've seen\n   many, many, many immigrants, undocumented immigrants, becoming millionaires\n   with starting their own businesses. And I know many cases where, if not\n   millionaires, they're living very good because they started their own\n   business and just because they're allowed to get their business going and\n   everything. Over here, the bureaucracy and the corruption, it's killing the\n   small businesses. The enterprise or the small business is under the\n   corruption and the bureaucracy of Mexico.\n \n \n  "
