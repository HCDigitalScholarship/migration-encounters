  "text":"Jeimmy: And the teachers, they were all so different. The English teacher\n   was like, \"Oh, okay, you know English. Perfect. Just do one examen [exam]\n   and whatever you get on that examen, va ser tu calificaci\u00f3n para todo el\n   semestre.\" [exam will be your grade for the semester]And I'm like, \"Okay,\n   10, there you go.\" A 10 for the whole semester. I didn't have to go to the\n   classes because the teacher already knew that I knew English.\n \n \n  "
