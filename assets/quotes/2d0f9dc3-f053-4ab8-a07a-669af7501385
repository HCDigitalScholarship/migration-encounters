That's like, I don't know, you tell that to your\n   kid, \"Hey you're illegal\" and that's what they kind of start to think as\n   they get older. Like, \u201cDon't trust authority, don't go to the police.\u201d You\n   just get in this mindset of wanting to be a criminal because it\u2019s just kind\n   of what path is chosen for you.\n \n \n  "
