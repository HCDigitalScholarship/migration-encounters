  "text":"Miguel: A lot of construction jobs, I was 14, and it was an under the table\n   job remodeling houses. And the guy I worked for, he was like, \"You're\n   really young.\" That was during the summer. So I was like, \"It's just a\n   summer job.\" He was like, \"Alright, I might hire you.\" And he was paying me\n   $10 an hour. And he was buying me food. And he was like taking me places,\n   he was really nice, really nice people. And they were actually very very\n   concerned about my legal status as well in the States. They were those type\n   of people that if they could help me they would. And unfortunately, I lost\n   contact with them because they left to Virginia. And I was in Oregon. And I\n   know if I would have been able to contact one of them, they would have been\n   able to help me with maybe a bond or something to pay the bail. But, they\n   were really good people and I wasn't doing much because of the fact that I\n   spoke English and Spanish.\n \n \n  "
