I was used to it at least,\n   because growing up my mom didn't have a job so she couldn't provide for us\n   even if she wanted to, because she's illegal. So what we would do is we\n   would make fake CDs, and every morning I would just wake up, go to\n   different little towns and stuff, sell CDs.\n \n \n  "
