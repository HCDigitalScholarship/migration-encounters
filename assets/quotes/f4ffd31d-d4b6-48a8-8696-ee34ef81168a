  "text":"They were\n like, \"Okay, look, we got the deal with the judge, he just said all you\n have to do is wait till Monday when the probation office is open again, so\n that way you go from here, your probation officer's going to pick you up\n here at the holding cell, he's going to take you straight to the probation\n office, they're going to go ahead and take your documentation, your phone\n number, address, everything they need from you so that way you can already\n get registered and that way, we know for a fact that you're going to take\n your probation and you're already registered into it.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I was like, \"Okay, yeah. Sounds like a deal.\" I'm already signing the\n paperwork saying that I'm pretty much going to be free on Monday, I just\n got to wait till Monday because of the probation office. The whole weekend\n I was excited. I was like, I'm leaving Monday, finally I'm out of here. I\n know I got to go through probation, but this time, I'm going to take it\n seriously. It's only one more year. I'm just going to chill out for a year.\n      \n      \n Axel: Monday came, they took me out of my cell, they gave me my regular\n clothes, everything, gave my paperwork to leave, everything was cool.\n Probation officer started getting there and they picked up everybody except\n me. And they asked me, she's like, \"Hey, what are you waiting for?\" I'm\n like, \"I'm waiting for a probation officer too.\" So I looked up my name and\n everything and they were like, \"Oh, well, actually, it looks like\n immigration put a hold on you just last night at one or two in the morning.\n So actually, we're going to have to put you back in your cell.\" He's like,\n \"But don't worry, we're going to put you back in the same one so that way\n you can go back in with the same people that you were in there with and you\n don't have to meet some new people and stuff.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: I'm like, I\u2019m not worried about that. I want to go outside with the\n people I've been knowing for years, my family and stuff. I was really\n disappointed at that point. I was really depressed. I got upset, I called\n my parents and my friends were like, \"Hey, are you out already? Where are\n you so we can go pick you up?\" I'm like, \"I'm inside my cell.\""
