  "text":"Anita: Like I don't even know. Are you different from other Mexican men in\n   a relationship kind of is the question.\n \n \n   Jesus: Yeah. That's the difficult thing, is not only am I binational and\n   Hispanic, I'm from the north of Mexico. A lot of my culture from the north\n   over there, it's really about machismo. And I was like, \"Oh man.\" Over\n   there, the reality is still women being abused, and all that stuff. So,\n   when I tend to drink, sometimes I get angry and I started getting\n   aggressive and like I told my ex, I was like, \"I can't drink, I can't\n   drink. Not with you.\" We tried drinking a few times, and things just kind\n   of got out of control. She would become controlling, and then I'd start to\n   get angry. I start to see my dad's side inside of me. And I'm just like,\n   \"No, this just can't happen.\" So, that's where we were running into issues\n   too. And coming from the States, I was raised in the Pacific Northwest and\n   there's a big movement for Civil Rights and stuff over there too, women's\n   rights and equality. So, I have a lot of those same mentalities still, like\n   respect women, try and keep things fair. But then over here, I feel like\n   women have been brought down so much, that they want to see how much more\n   they can get.\n \n \n  "
