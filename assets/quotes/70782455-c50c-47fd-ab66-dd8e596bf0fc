She was really distant from talking about that. For example, now that I\n   live here and I say that, \"Oh, my mom is an indigenous woman,\" she's like,\n   \"Oh, can you spoke a tongue or something like that? Can you spoke another\n   language?\" I'm like, \"No.\" \"Why not?\" She didn't really like to mention it.\n   It wasn't something that she brought up to people.\n \n \n  "
