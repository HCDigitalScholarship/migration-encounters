  "text":"They detained me there. I was there for six hours. I remember not being fed\n   until a police guy, I guess he was Hispanic, he asked me, \"Have you eaten?\"\n   I said, \"No, I haven't.\" He went and got me some McDonald's. I do remember\n   it was a long time, though. Then, they took me in to the county. I was in\n   Arkansas. I went into _____________. Then that's whenever I said, \"Okay, so\n   it's real.\" They put me into the outfit, it was an orange outfit. I was\n   separated with other people. It was hard because I didn't know, I didn't\n   understand like that. I said, \"Well, I don't think I can compare myself to\n   them. They really are people who either hurt people or they\u2019ve done\n   damages. I don't think I have done that.\" I was in there with those people,\n   so I guess they put me in the same category as those people.\n \n \n  "
