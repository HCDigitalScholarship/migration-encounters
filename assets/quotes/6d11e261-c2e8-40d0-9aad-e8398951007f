  "text":"Axel: Well, the license is a lot harder now, but I never got that at all.\n The only thing the cops ever did when they pulled me over in the car, the\n car was under my name, it was registered with my name, I had my insurance,\n everything. But I already knew that every time the cops pulled me over, I\n at least had to pay a $333 fine for not having a license. I would never\n tell them I don't have one, I would just say I don't have it on me. That's\n something that my parents always taught me from a young age, because they\n don't have one, and they're like, \"You'll never want to say that you don't\n have it. You just want to say you forgot it.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: Right. They'll let you go. They say, \"Okay, next time, make sure you\n have your license with you. Here's a fine for 330 for not having it with\n you.\" Now, if you say you don't have one period, they'll most likely take\n your car and everything from you because you're not even allowed to be\n driving at all, whether the car is yours or not. Over there, to work, you\n can work at any age as long as you had that fake ID. But even with that\n fake ID, you could only get into restaurants or fast food places. You\n couldn't get into Walmart or anything like that, because they ask for\n legal...They actually ran the social security check.\n      \n      \n"
