  "text":"Lizzy: Do you remember what your first day of school was like in the US?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. It was like, \u201cI don't know what the hell is going on.\u201d\n [Chuckles]. Literally, I just got in there and they were talking in\n English, and I was like, \u201cOkay, I don't know what the hell you're saying.\u201d\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Yeah. You probably didn't know any English, right?\n      \n      \n Jesus: No, I didn't. Exactly. I was just confused. I don't know what to do.\n Yeah. But I had a teacher that spoke Spanish. I remember she told me once,\n \"I'm going to help you out for a little bit. Hablar espa\u00f1ol e ingl\u00e9s.\" I\n was like, \u201cOh, that's cool.\u201d But I remember one day, I think she got\n frustrated or something, and she's like, \"I'm not going to talk to you in\n Spanish anymore. This is the last day I'm talking to you in Spanish. That's\n it.\"\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Oh, wow. Was that scary, to have her Spanish taken away?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I was just like, \u201cDamn. I don't know what I'm going to do now.\u201d So,\n I just had to learn English, and I did.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Do you think that that helped you learn more or made it worse?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I think it did, I think it did help me, because if she would've just\n been speaking Spanish, I would've just continued, so I wouldn't have\n learned as much.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Yeah, then you were forced to speak English?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, it was practical, you have to do it. So, I was like, \u201cAll\n right,\u201d so I did it.\n      \n      \n"
