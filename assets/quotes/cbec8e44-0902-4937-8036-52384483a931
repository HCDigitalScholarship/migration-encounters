Everything has always been extremely easy for me.\n   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.\n   I think the problem with human beings is that you\u2019re your only true enemy.\n   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you\n   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,\n   sniffles].\n \n \n  "
