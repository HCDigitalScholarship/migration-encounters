  "text":"Most of my friends were Americans\n   so they didn't know I was undocumented and I didn't tell anyone.\n \n \n   Anne: Did you know all along that you were undocumented?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, I did. But, my brother, he took a lot of more time to realize\n   that we were not Americans because when he went to the US, he was really a\n   kid, so he didn't realize that it was illegal. [chuckles]\n \n \n   Anne: Did your mother learn English, too?\n \n \n   Laura: She tried, but it was a little more complicated for her because\n   there are no programs that support those kinds of like, to learn English\n   undocumented. She's afraid that if she got into one of those programs, the\n   ICE is going to get her caught, so that's why.\n \n \n   Anne: So, she was afraid?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, she was afraid.\n \n \n  "
