  "text":"Dan: Yes. It was this lady where I went over and gave her an estimate. And\n   she offered to give me her credit card to go ahead and buy the material.\n   When I bought the material, it was more money that we quoted, but I told\n   her that it could vary. I gave her all the material. I gave her all the\n   receipts, and she was not happy about it. She went over and accused me of\n   credit card abuse. I got an attorney and it was like, \"Hey, don't worry\n   about it. I already got you a deal. It's only going to be 10 days in jail.\n   And it's going to be only weekends.\" And like, \"Okay.\" Immigration doesn't\n   work on weekends, so I will turn myself in on a Friday night and then I\n   will come out on Monday 12:01 in the morning so it will count four days. I\n   turned myself in and when I was about to get ready to get out, I called the\n   guards and say, \"Hey, I need to take a shower because I'm about to go to\n   work.\" So they let me out. Took my shower, went back to my cell. And then\n   about twelve midnight, they called me up and say, \"Hey, Cabrero, come\n   down.\" So I went down. They're like, \"Man, I cannot let you out because you\n   have an INS [Immigration and Naturalization Service] hold.\" I'm like,\n   \"What?\" They were like, \"Yeah, you have an immigration hold.\" \"No, not\n   really.\" That's when I lost my house, I lost my trucks, my trailers, my\n   tools, my home, everything.\n \n \n   Isabel: You were living with your family?\n \n \n   Dan: I was already with my wife and my kids at my own property. I was at my\n   own house. She had to let everything go. Yeah.\n \n \n  "
