  "text":"It was like I can maybe grow to be something or somebody out\n   here. All those dreams, all those ideas, all those great thoughts, all\n   those great ideas and great plans that you had get taken away from you like\n   literally, like in days. You don't have those hopes anymore. You're out\n   here, you lose all hope. I did. I mean I\u2019m alone out here pretty much.\n \n \n   Miguel: I mean I have my dad's sister and my dad's brother, but they're not\n   very, I can\u2019t count on them for things. I've struggled a lot. And right now\n   I'm without a phone, because I had to pawn my cell phone because I had to\n   pay my rent. I work and I get paid, it's just that it's really hard. I used\n   to live in a different state here. And I was paying 60 pesos every day just\n   for bus fare, getting to work and back and forth. And that was if I was\n   lucky to get a bus that would take me halfway to my house. But then again,\n   you have to pay like 30 pesos more for it. That's what was getting to me.\n   And right now I'm struggling a little bit with my rent. I just started\n   working here in April. In Tele Tech, and it's, I'm barely getting there.\n   And like I said, my family, I'd rather be struggling on my own than with\n   them because they live in an area where there's a lot of drug sale, a lot\n   of bad things. On my dad's side, and my cousins they've stolen from me.\n \n \n   Miguel: Yeah. And I don't even feel safe with my own family. So that's why\n   I tend to stay on my own. Like be on my own, if I eat, good, If I don't,\n   that's okay as well. At least I know it's because of me and not because\n   someone else caused it. But I'm trying my best right now to get back on my\n   feet because I lost a lot of things last year, in November. I got stabbed.\n   They took all my stuff. I had a laptop. I lost that. That's pretty much\n   what I had to go through to be able to be on my own to be free again, you\n   know just be like, \"Alright, you guys can rob me and do what you can, you\n   know, but at least I'll be okay.\" And, yeah, that happened last year. And\n   since then I still haven't really been able to recover."
