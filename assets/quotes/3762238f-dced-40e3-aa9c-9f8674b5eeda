  "text":"Laura: Okay. When I went to the U.S., I was 12 years old approximately. I'm\n   right now 26 years old. I used to live on Iguala Guerrero, and if you know,\n   Guerrero is one of the poorest states in Mexico.\n \n \n   Laura: So we were really struggling with a lot of payments. Sometimes we\n   didn't have anything to eat. We ate tacos, and that was all we ate in a\n   whole day. So the education was pretty bad. Sometimes we went to school or\n   sometimes we didn't because, well, we didn't have money to go to the\n   school.\n \n \n   Laura: My mom was getting paid well, a really low wage. She was getting\n   paid about 700 pesos per week. That's about ... I'm not sure. Is that $35\n   per week]? We were struggling a lot. When we went to the US, we're trying\n   to look for better living, having to eat something. I don't know. Like, a\n   lifestyle, a proper lifestyle.\n \n \n  "
