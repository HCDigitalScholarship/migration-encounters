  "text":"Sylent:\n \n \n   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to\n   hip hop, like, \"Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.\"\n   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that\n   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,\n   they say, \"No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you.\" Those\n   were the words. I'm like, \"What do you mean?\" It's like, \"Yes. The way you\n   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you.\" I\n   said, \"What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter\n   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?\"\n   \"No.\" Because I had piercings also. Then it's, \"Because our image is not\n   like that.\" I was like, \"Why?\"\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Every job I try to go get, it was like, \"No.\" I was shut down. I learned\n   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started\n   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go\n   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's\n   like, \"Wow. So, it was just all about image.\" If you look nice, they're\n   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or\n   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my\n   advantage and said, \"Okay. I need to do something.\" That's when I said,\n   \"Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking.\" I\n   started looking for schools.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Then there was this one school that they said, \"Hey, I don't care how you\n   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to\n   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit.\" I'm like,\n   \"Okay. I can do that, I guess.\" I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,\n   \"Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?\" I said, \"Why not? Maybe\n   it could be better.\" So, I did change for that school, but then I realized\n   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to\n   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, \"No. I can't do that no more.\n   I can't.\" Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's\n   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.\n   So, I said, \"No. I have to quit. I have to quit. I am getting paid well, I\n   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.\"\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   I got out, and then I realized that I didn't have to be different. I could\n   still be me, but I could act some way around certain people. Yeah, it was\n   hard because I didn't want to, I didn't want to but I felt like I have to\n   because if I didn't I wouldn't get what I wanted, or obtain what I would\n   get. But I do feel bad for becoming, not a total prick, but I do remember\n   saying, \"I don't know, don't buy from him because he's from the street,\" or\n   \"Don't buy your groceries there because it's not a good store.\" Things like\n   that.\n \n \n  "
