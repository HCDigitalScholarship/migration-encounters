  "text":"Dan: Well, at one point everybody\u2014when I said everybody, I'm talking about\n   my mom, my dad, and my sisters. We were able to qualify to be American\n   citizens after so long being a permanent resident. And in my mind, it was\n   like, \"Why am I going to be showing a visa going to my own country?\" That\n   was the only reason that I didn't want to go for it. Now I regret it, but I\n   just didn't want to do it because, I guess, lack of information, not enough\n   information that I was or I wasn't going to need that. And time went by and\n   I regret it now.\n \n \n  "
