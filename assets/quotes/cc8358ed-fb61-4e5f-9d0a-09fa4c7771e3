  "text":"Ben: I didn't want to waste two years. So, they deported me, I asked\n the judge to sign, and I signed and that same evening I was on the bus to\n Lorado, caught a bus to Saltillo, , and then this was a day before\n Thanksgiving, when I arrived in Mexico. And then I stayed there in Saltillo\n up through December, through Christmas. Christmas my parents came to visit,\n and my girlfriend had come to visit too, my girlfriend had come to visit\n around Christmas and then they left.\n      \n      \n Anne: They were all citizens?\n      \n      \n Ben: Yeah. And then we had plans to get married and my girlfriend, she\n was willing to come live here, give everything up in the states and live\n here, even though she's a citizen. So, I said, \"Well if you really feel\n strongly then come on.\u201d So, she came to Mexico and when she arrived here in\n Mexico, I went to pick her up at the border, she came on the bus right\n across from Eagle Path. So, I met her there and then brought her back to my\n family's house.\n      \n      \n Ben: Then we get there and we're there\u2014and then my parents had arrived\n there too\u2014and she goes, \"When are we heading back?\" because she thought we\n were going to Saltillo, because I told her it's a big city, better\n opportunities there. I go, \"Oh we're not going to Saltillo.\u201d She goes,\n \"Well where are we going?\" I go, \"You think I'm going to sit here and years\n later we're going to be worried about our kids, where they're at, because\n you know they're not going to stay put here. They're going to jump that\n border.\u201d And I go, \"So what are we going to do?\" \"Well I'm going to take\n that risk right now, I'm going to jump it right now.\u201d She goes, \"No you\n can't.\u201d I go, \"You watch me. Let's go, we're leaving tomorrow\".\n      \n      \n"
