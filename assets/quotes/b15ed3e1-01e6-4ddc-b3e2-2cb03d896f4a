  "text":"Laura: Yeah, I do remember it. Well, I'm afraid of mice. So, when we\n   crossed the border, it was actually really awkward for me because we went\n   into a tunnel. It was really dark, though.\n \n \n   Laura: So, when we went through the tunnel, I remember it was pretty dark.\n   We have a lot of mice on our feet and snakes. Oh my god, even if you have\n   the eyes open you cannot see anything because everything was dark. The\n   coyote was telling us not to make any noises. I was like, \u201cI want to scream\n   because I'm feeling the mice on my feet. I just want to scream and say, \u2018Oh\n   my god,\u2019 or \u2018Ah,\u2019 something, but I couldn't.\u201d\n \n \n   Laura: My brother, when we crossed the border\u2014my mom has already been in\n   the US for one year, so we crossed the border by ourselves]\u2014when we went\n   with the coyote, he was like, \"Do not make any noises. We're going to\n   walk.\u201d I don't remember how much we walk. We were pretty tired. We can only\n   carry one bottle of water and we have already taken all, and when we cross\n   the whole border, there was a car. It was waiting for us. We went to the\n   car, they put a bandage in our eyes so we don't see the road.\n \n \n   Laura: The coyote was always telling us to not make any noises because the\n   border patrol was going to get us caught. I do remember everything like the\n   experience was yesterday. So, when we got in the\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: So, it was just you, and your brother, and the coyote?\n \n \n   Laura: And the coyote?\n \n \n   Anne: That was it?\n \n \n   Laura: Yeah, it was me, my brother, the coyote, and another three people.\n   It was a partner: the kid, one kid, and another, a man. We were like five\n   people, six, seven people. Kind of remember\u2014it was a long time ago. My mom\n   was not there because we went by ourselves. She was already in the US so\n   she pay to get us into the other side. [Chuckles].\n \n \n  "
