  "text":"Axel: She didn't want none of that. And then one day, I don't know what\n happened. Her mom fell asleep with a cigarette or something, house caught\n on fire, everything burnt. Thankfully, nobody got hurt, but all of the\n clothes, everything got lost. I'm like, \"You see? Your TV got lost, all\n your furniture got lost, your everything, all this stuff got lost.\" I was\n like, \"You could have had all that stuff if you would have stayed at my\n apartment. You would have had your own personal stuff, nothing like that\n would have happened.\" I was like, \"But you took advantage of it, you took\n it all and did I don't know what with it. I'm not going to ask you, I\n really don't care. I gave it to you, so I'm not going to expect an\n explanations on it.\"\n      \n      \n Axel: And she got mad at me because of that. She got mad because I told her\n that stuff. I was like, \"Well, I'm not arguing with you, I'm just saying\n look, sometimes things happen for a reason.\" I was like, \"Everything\n happens for a reason, I believe that.\" My mom didn't like that about me.\n She didn't like the fact that I was so accepting of the things that\n happened to me in life. She was like, \"You shouldn't be like just oh well,\n everything happens for a reason or shouldn't be too upbeat about stuff.\"\n Not upbeat, but yeah, upbeat. I shouldn't be taking it so good, so lightly.\n She wanted me to take it more heavily. She's like, \"Hey, you're getting in\n trouble. You're going to get deported. You should be taking it more\n heavily, you should be upset.\"\n      \n      \n"
