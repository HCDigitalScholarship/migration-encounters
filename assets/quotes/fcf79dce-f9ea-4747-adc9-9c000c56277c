  "text":"Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle\n school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.\n There was a point where one of my teachers\u2014one of my reading\n teachers\u2014basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching\n wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the\n book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.\n      \n      \n Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah. So\u2014\n      \n      \n Isabel: In what grade?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I\n feel like, \u201cOkay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're\n saying I'm doing good.\" And I'm sorry, what was the question?\n      \n      \n Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,\n like refusing those opportunities.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I\n got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front\n of a bunch of people. The website was legit\u2014it was if you search poetry on\n Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point\n where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate\n inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran\n around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that\n risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get\n deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.\n      \n      \n Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yes.\n      \n      \n Isabel: What was it about?\n      \n      \n Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,\n yeah.\n      \n      \n Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you\n pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition\n for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that\n you can't go over.\n      \n      \n Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that \"No, you can't.\"\n Basically, for me it was like, \u201cSo what's the point? So what am I working\n for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,\n what's the point?\u201d And I really never saw a future after middle school.\n      \n      \n Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time\n staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.\n So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of\n the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that\n work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior\n year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?\n      \n      \n Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on\n it was basically work, work, work. And that was basically my life after\n junior year\u2014just work and work.\n      \n      \n"
