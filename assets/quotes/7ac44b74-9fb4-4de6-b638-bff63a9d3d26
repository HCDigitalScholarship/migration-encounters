  "text":"Donovan: Yeah. Because you really get in touch with mother earth. You\n   really understand what's going on. My teacher, she took me to South Dakota.\n   You talk to a lot of ancestors, a lot of wise people, and it's crazy. I\n   used to be mad at the world because I didn't have my dad. I was like, \u201cI\n   see everybody has their dad and I never had my dad.\u201d I met my stepdad when\n   I was nine. And he's an amazing, he's an amazing human being.\n \n \n   Donovan: I don't know, if it wasn't for him, I wouldn't have had this\n   stuff. He actually bought me my first pair of sneakers. I still remember,\n   they were some Filas, Grant Hill's, white and blue and red. I still\n   remember. Before my stepdad we were poor, poor, poor, poor, poor. We always\n   had dress shoes with shorts. We always had dress shoes with pants.\n   [Chuckles]. The kids are really not the nicest persons. [Chuckles].\n   Nowadays I like to clean my shoes, keep them really clean. I like to dress\n   how I like to dress. But if it wasn't for my stepdad, I don't know. I don't\n   think we would have had the advantage that he gave"
