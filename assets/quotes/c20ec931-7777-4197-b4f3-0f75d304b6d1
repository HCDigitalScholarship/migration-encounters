  "text":"Hugo: I've had ideas that there's some type of programs or something that\n   might help all people trying to go back and that would be awesome because\n   it would all be legal. And what I'm working on is, if in case an\n   opportunity comes up like that, I can show my past ten years: I've been a\n   productive member of society or the community or what not, and no illegal\n   activity, no bad, no ill will toward anyone, just working, having my\n   family, doing my thing. What I have to do, you know? I have my license. I\n   have my car. I pay my rent.\n \n \n  "
