  "text":"Anita: What has Mexico gained by gaining you?\n \n \n   Luisa: I think they've gained a lot. I think Mexico has gained a lot, but\n   they don't know how to appreciate it. They pretty much throw us aside.\n   Unfortunately, the Mexican government does not think that people who are\n   returning from the States have anything to offer, and they're dead wrong\n   about that. Honestly, if you look at a lot of these people that are coming\n   back, they have so much to offer. They have so much to give and they have\n   so much drive and they're hungry, but they don't make it easy for us.\n \n \n   Luisa: I had to go through hell in order to get my paperwork done for\n   school\u2014through hell, and then I still had to do two years. If that was\n   somebody else with a little bit less drive or a little bit less enthusiasm,\n   they would've given up and they wouldn't have continued with their studies.\n   They would've said, \"Fuck it. Why? They're putting me against the wall. How\n   am I supposed to do anything?\u201d Anyone else for sure would've, and I know a\n   lot of cases where they're like, \"Dude, it's just too hard. It's too hard\n   to keep going. They're asking me to do everything that I've already done,\n   and what they're asking me to do is subpar compared to the education that\n   I've had.\" So it's extremely discourag"
