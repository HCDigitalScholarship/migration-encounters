  "text":"Many: Well, back in 1995, it was kind of easy. It was easy to cross the\n   border. What I do, I just jumped onto the train on this side of Mexico and\n   I just wait for the train to cross the bridge and like four hours later, I\n   was in Corpus Christi, Texas. So, everything was new for me. I didn't know\n   what I had to do to go with my uncle, but I just find some people who speak\n   Spanish and they helped me to call my uncle and just let him know that I\n   was in Corpus Christi and he just go on and pick me up. That's what\n   happened.\n \n \n  "
