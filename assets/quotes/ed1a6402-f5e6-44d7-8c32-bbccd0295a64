One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to\n   Chicago\u2014a job opportunity\u2014so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,\n   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really\n   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us\n   in.\n \n \n  "
