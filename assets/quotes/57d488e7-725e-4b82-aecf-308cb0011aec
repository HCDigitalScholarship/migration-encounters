I know of people that\n   are living on the street, they don't have nowhere to stay because they\n   can't afford it, they cannot pay. How can they afford it if they cannot get\n   a job? If they cannot get a job, if they can't get a way to make their\n   living, how in the world are they going to do? What are they going to do?\n   So many, many end up in drugs or in alcoholism. And I just hope, my hope is\n   for this to reach the right ears and for someone to do something about all\n   this crisis. Because it's a humanitarian crisis, that's what it is.\n \n \n  "
