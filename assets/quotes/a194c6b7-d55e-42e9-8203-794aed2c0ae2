Were you in the gang or just\n   affiliated around it?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah, I was in the gang.\n \n \n   Isabel: In the gang as well?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: And what do you think drew you to that? Because one thing my\n   professor's interested in is the sort of factors that draw or bring kids\n   into gangs and that kind of activity, away from school and stuff, what the\n   trends are. What was it in your case?\n \n \n   Pablo: In my case, where I grew up, we did have a few different cliques\n   that were not getting along together. So it was basically... How can I say?\n   Just wanted everybody to know you, everybody to respect you, and know that\n   you were part of the best team, or best gang, whatever, that's it.\n \n \n   Isabel: So would you say it was a pride thing or more protection?\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah, it's a pride thing. It's a pride thing. Yeah.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah, especially if you had family members who were already in it.\n   That's on top of being sort of like brothers through that. You're also\n   already by blood, as well.\n \n \n   Pablo: Yeah.\n \n \n  "
