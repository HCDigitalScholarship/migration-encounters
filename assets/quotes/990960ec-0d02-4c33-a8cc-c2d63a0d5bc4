  "text":"Juan: When I came back, I came back by bus. And as soon as I crossed the\n   border, the Mexican border, it seems like I stepped into another world. It\n   was the same, the authorities, they are very rude, they are corrupt, they\n   want money for anything. They actually stole a document from my wife. My\n   wife, she's an American citizen, and they asked her for her passport. And\n   for them to give her the document as she was crossing to Mexico, they\n   charged her $60 for that document. When later I find out that it has to be\n   free. If you register, if you tell them that you're there and all that,\n   that document's supposed to be free. These policemen, they charged her $60.\n   Then, when I was getting my bags checked at the customs, they wanted me to\n   pay money to let me take my bags. And I just, I started fighting, arguing\n   with them. Not necessarily fighting, but I was arguing with them that, why\n   I had to pay them for something that was mine, it was my clothes, my shoes,\n   all my things. They wanted me to give money to allow me to take my things.\n   And when I started stating my case and fighting back, they had no choice\n   but to let me go. But it is that corruption in Mexico that makes it scary.\n \n \n  "
