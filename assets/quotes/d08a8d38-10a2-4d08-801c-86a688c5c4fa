  "text":"Miguel: Never really\u2026 I like fast cars but never really into illegal street\n   racing or anything like that. But out there in Portland, they had a\n   racetrack so I was able to go out there and see people race their cars and\n   things like that. I like technology. It seems like I want to study, I want\n   a career. I want to work in something that involves technology because\n   Mexico doesn't really have much technology and they don't really make much\n   of anything. And it would be somethin\u2019 great, to be able to be in a country\n   and do somethin\u2019 with their water system as well. I hear a lot of people\n   are left without water, it's very frustrating when you want to get up, take\n   a shower and there's no water, there's no electricity or there's no gas.\n   And that's the kinda things I don't like going through out here. And out\n   there, I was living in a one-bedroom apartment with hot water with, you\n   know, electricity. You pay your light bill, you're going to have\n   electricity, you pay everything.\n \n \n   Miguel: But out here, it's just like everybody is. I don't know, they don't\n   pay their electricity bills out here. So they just like hang off of other\n   people's light. And sometimes they find out, the next thing you know,\n   you're without electricity. Like, right now, we suffer from that. Our\n   lights get cut off a lot. Our water goes away a lot, too. And it's very\n   frustrating, because it's something that I'm not used to. I'm not saying\n   that I had the best life. But I lived comfortable. I wasn't rich, and I\n   wasn't wealthy, either. I was just being responsible and working and\n   getting my moneys, getting what I was working for. And that was a thing.\n   And out here's like, I think the more you work out here as well, the less\n   you make.\n \n \n  "
