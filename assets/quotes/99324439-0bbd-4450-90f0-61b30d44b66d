And I remember one time the cops came to my house, because my\n   little brother was playing outside and it was school hours. And they're\n   like, \"What is this kid doing outside?\" And I remember him crying outside,\n   because the cops got him. And I was like, \"Oh my God, what do I do?\"\n \n \n  "
