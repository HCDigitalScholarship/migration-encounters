It's still my dream.\n \n \n   Anne: Where will that house be?\n \n \n   Jose: In ___. I'm definitely going back to the States.\n \n \n   Anne: You liked ____?\n \n \n   Jose: Yeah. It's not really the city that I like. It's the people that\n   lived within it. My friends and my family and the relationships I had with\n   coworkers and stuff. The reason I would go back is not for the city itself\n   but for the people that are there.\n \n \n  "
