So\u2026we were like in this town,\n   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No\n   wait\u2026secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird\n   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only\n   white kid, I was, and it was weird.\n \n \n   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully\n   you for that, or like what?\n \n \n   Roberto: Well yeah, sometimes I got bullied you know. Yeah, ya sabes dos\n   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I\n   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that\n   as well. But like, me too, yo tambien me pasaba delante [I did the same]. I\n   used to call them also by their nicknames and all that stuff.\n \n \n  "
