  "text":"Anne: What position do you play?\n \n \n   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got\n   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I\n   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer\u2014my cousin who lives here\n   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just\n   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and\n   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were\n   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,\n   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about\n   it.\n \n \n   Anne: That's too bad.\n \n \n   Juan: Yes [Chuckles].\n \n \n   Anne: Do you follow the soccer leagues or national teams at all?\n \n \n   Juan: I used to be really into the teams, but not anymore. Right now my\n   focus is on other things and on the things that I used to think of. Right\n   now, I'd rather focus on other things than keeping up with teams.\n \n \n  "
