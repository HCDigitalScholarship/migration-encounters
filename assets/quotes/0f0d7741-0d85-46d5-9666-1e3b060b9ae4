  "text":"Sylent:\n \n \n   Well, since I learned that I was living illegally in the United States, I\n   got discriminated for that. They would call me \u201cillegal Mexican.\u201d So I took\n   that as a positive thing and said, \"Yes, I am,\" and I felt like I needed to\n   represent that not just for myself but for a whole generation because\n   there's a lot of people just like me whose parents took them to the United\n   States, and they struggled through the same thing. I felt that I needed to\n   represent them. I didn't get the tattoos until I came back to Mexico.\n   That's how it started. I do remember in high school, most of my friends\n   that I hung out with were all Mexican, we were all born in Mexico. I guess\n   that's how it started, just hanging out with friends and making jokes about\n   it.\n \n \n   Sylent:\n \n \n   Eventually it became something that we represented. Other people knew that\n   we were illegal so we took that another step and we said, \"Yes. Yes, we\n   are. We are illegal aliens. We are, but we're also Americans. We share the\n   same traditions, we celebrate Thanksgiving, we celebrate the 4th of July.\"\n   We had to be more Mexican than the Mexicans and more American than the\n   Americans. That's how it started.\n \n \n  "
