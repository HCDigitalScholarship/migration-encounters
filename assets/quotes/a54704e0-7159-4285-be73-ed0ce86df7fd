  "text":"Luisa: I'm not sure if you're familiar with Maus, the comic books. I\n   painted this huge painting because I painted as well [Chuckles]. Yes, I\n   paint, as well. It was another emotional or creative outlet that I had, and\n   I painted this huge thing for him and he still has it. I've asked him about\n   it recently and he'll take a picture of the painting."
