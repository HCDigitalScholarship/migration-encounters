I never had any papers or any ID or anything\n   like that, and I actually, I made up my own card, so I worked over there\n   too by cleaning yards. I actually worked for a little while in the boat\n   factory with my parents. I used to get paid, I think, $450 a week. That's\n   how I started saving.\n \n \n  "
