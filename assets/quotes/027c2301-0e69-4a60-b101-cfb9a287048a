  "text":"Josue: No, myself. I got made fun of in PE class. We were in Seattle, so\n   not a lot of non-English, well, Spanish speaking people. But yeah, I got\n   made fun of my English in PE. \u2018Cause I remember I was wearing like an Old\n   Navy shirt with an American flag right here. And there was a guy in my PE\n   class, which were the classes that were not ESL, so it was mostly white\n   people. And so, I remember him saying something to the effect of, \u201cHow were\n   you even wearing that when you can't even speak the language?\u201d\n \n \n   Josue: And so, I actually started to, what I would do is that I would get\n   music. I listened to a lot of music with a Spanish-English dictionary and\n   me sitting in my living room with that, a lot. And I was the first one in\n   my family to speak it. I don't even think a year went by before I remember\n   speaking where I felt comfortable I guess.\n \n \n  "
