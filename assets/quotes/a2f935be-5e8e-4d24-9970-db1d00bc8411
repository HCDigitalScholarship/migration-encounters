But you'll get used to it.\n   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my\n   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think\n   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one\n   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard\n   to get the food in the table.\n \n \n  "
