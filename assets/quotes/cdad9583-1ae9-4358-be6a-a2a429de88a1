Just barely, I guess.\n \n \n   Claudia: What was it like coming back to Mexico? You said you made the\n   decision on your own?\n \n \n   Yosell: Yeah, I mean, I already did know about it just a little bit, so it\n   wasn't too bad. It was just basically like Los Angeles, it's the same\n   thing, really. Just the differences, the corruption out here, and how\n   people treat you. I would probably walk down the street, and I would always\n   get a dirty look or something. I'd always get checked by the cops here,\n   that's a constant thing for me.\n \n \n  "
