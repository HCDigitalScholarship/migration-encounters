  "text":"In Miss S. class, I remember there were two boys who were nice to\n   me, J___ and\u2014 what's his name? Sorry. I still know him. He's still a good\n   friend of mine. O___. They both kind of spoke Spanish, so they kind of\n   helped me out as well, but I wasn't allowed to speak to anyone. The teacher\n   was not having it \u2026 She was extremely strict. I think she was the kind of\n   teacher that should not have ever taken up teaching as a job because some\n   people just don't have the vocation. Is that the word in English? They\n   don't have that in them and I don't think she had it, but they helped out a\n   lot. J___ and Osvaldo, thank you wherever you are now. I know O___ is\n   getting married soon, so yes.\n \n \n  "
