  "text":"Rocio: So that's when I need to make that decision to let him go, with my\n   friend. She's everything to me. Of course, she's very, very\u2014a great family.\n   She just have a son. So, she signed it like a tutor [inquisitive] to keep\n   him until I was able to come back. Because at the beginning I was fighting\n   to go back and talking with everybody, but they told me, you have 10 years\n   and you need to stay over there. So it was extremely hard for me to make\n   that decision, but it's not for me. It's his life. He has everything over\n   there. And I'm not going to take that away from him.\n \n \n  "
