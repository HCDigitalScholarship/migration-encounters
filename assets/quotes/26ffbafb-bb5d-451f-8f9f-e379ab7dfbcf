  "text":"Axel: Yeah, it's a big expense and the girl I got with, my ex-wife, she\n already had a baby. I had a stepson and then I was going to have my son,\n and also to buy stuff here and send it over there for my daughter. I don't\n send them money because I know the money that I could send a whole paycheck\n from that I get right now, and it would be like maybe $100 or $150 for\n them, almost nothing. So I know that instead of doing that, I know I could\n buy some stuff here. Toys, shoes, clothes and I could send to them, my\n parents will cover the fee of paying the shipping and I know it will help\n them a lot more than me sending them $100 or something like that, and it\n would affect me a lot more here.\n      \n      \n"
