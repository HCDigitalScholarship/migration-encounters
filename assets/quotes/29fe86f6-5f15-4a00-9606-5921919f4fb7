  "text":"Luis: And the only thing that I don't like is that just because I was\n   Mexican, they assume a lot of things. Like the first day I got into that\n   high school, I was called to the principal's office and he asked me, \"Are\n   you in a gang? Why are you wearing those colors?\" The same thing! \"What\n   colors? What do you mean?\" I was wearing blue this time and then I kind of\n   got the gist of it, right? So I told him, \"Is it because of the blue?\n   Because this is not my first time, that people are asking me these dumb\n   questions\".\n \n \n  "
