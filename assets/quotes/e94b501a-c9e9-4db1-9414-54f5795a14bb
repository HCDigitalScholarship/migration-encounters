  "text":"Anne: You were enjoying school to some extent, and soccer. Did you get in\n   trouble at all?\n \n \n   Juan: When I was in high school, I did get in trouble because I did get in\n   a couple of fights, but to the extent to say that I was a trouble maker or\n   I wasn't disciplined, or to say that I didn't care about school, no. I\n   consider myself not a good kid because I did get in trouble, but a kid who\n   cared for his well being as in school-wise. I wanted to graduate, I wanted\n   to continue to college.\n \n \n   Anne: How old are you now?\n \n \n   Juan: Twenty four.\n \n \n   Anne: You wanted to go off to college, but that didn't happen or did it\n   happen?\n \n \n   Juan: Right now I am in college.\n \n \n   Anne: That's good.\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. Yes.\n \n \n  "
