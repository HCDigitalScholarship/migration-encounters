  "text":"Anita: A lot of people have told us about domestic violence. Why do you\n   think there's so much domestic violence?\n \n \n   Olimpya: Culture.\n \n \n   Anita: Tell me. What do you think? Say more.\n \n \n   Olimpya: Well, here in Mexico, girls or women, we're raised to serve. We're\n   not raised to think or do something on our own because it's dangerous for\n   us. But it's weird because if we stay at home, it's dangerous as well.\n   [Chuckles]. Men here think that we are weak, that we're not able to, that\n   we're not capable. So they don't let us do what they think we can't. That's\n   basically it. And since we're raised by Mexican women. So, me as a woman, I\n   have a son. I need to teach him how to respect and let a girl be, but all\n   girls here, they're not the same. They think, \"No, you're a girl, you need\n   to serve. You're a boy, they serve you.\" Then the daughter-in-law comes,\n   and then she's like, \"No, you need to serve my son. You need to do this for\n   my son.\" So it's education basically, ignorance.\n \n \n  "
