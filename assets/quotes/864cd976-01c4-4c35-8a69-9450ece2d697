  "text":"Anne: Tell us why the university of Chicago only gave you a full\n   scholarship for one semester.\n \n \n   Laura: What I was telling you before is that, to get any scholarship or to\n   get into university, if you don't have any social security number, you\n   cannot get into college. So what I did high school, I didn't tell anyone\n   about my status because I was really afraid to get deported. So basically I\n   put a fake social security number in my... How do you say that? My forms?\n \n \n   Anne: Application.\n \n \n   Laura: My applications, yeah. I put a play social security number in my\n   applications. That's the reason that they accept me. But when they find out\n   that I was undocumented, well, they only provide me with a one semester\n   scholarship. That's the reason that I only studied for one semester in\n   university of Chicago.\n \n \n  "
