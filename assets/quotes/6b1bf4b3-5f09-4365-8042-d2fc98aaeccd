  "text":"Juan: No, so my mom, she did have to walk when she crossed the border,\n   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the\n   mountains. My brother and I \u2026 my dad found a lady who had two young sons\n   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time\u2014I was eight, my\n   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat\u2014and then, like\n   any other family, we crossed the border.\n \n \n   Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let\n   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,\n   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she\n   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever\n   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because\n   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones\n   that was able to make it back to their families.\n \n \n  "
