  "text":"Luis: Yeah. So I was really disappointed. I just told my parents, \"You know\n   I'm out. This country doesn't want us here and my dreams keep getting\n   obstacles and obstacles, I just can't.\u201d They didn't want me to and for two\n   years they were like really against it. But I mean at the end of the day I\n   was almost over eighteen, so what could they do, right? So, I came back\n   with the hopes of going to school, be better. I'm actually the only one in\n   my family that has a bachelor's. [Emotional] So anyway, I come back because\n   I want to keep studying and I want to stop that cycle of not being free to do what I\n   want to do."
