  "text":"She sent me\n   some money. She sent me like 150 bucks, $150 something like that. She sent\n   it in Mexican pesos. So I had to change it at a bank and I just took a bus\n   near the border and I crossed by myself. I heard from a guy that chocolate\n   and chiles secos are the thing to keep you warm at night because, holy\n   shit, in the desert the fucking nights were horrible. It was horrible. It\n   was hell. If I'm honest with you, it was hell.\n \n \n   Anita: On your way home?\n \n \n   Luis: Across the border. I just jumped the fucking fence. Didn't give a\n   shit, but I said, \"If one of these officers are going to catch me, then go\n   ahead.\"\n \n \n   Anita: But you were crossing the border to go back home?\n \n \n   Luis: I was crossing the border to get into Sonora. When I crossed the\n   border, I could just pretend that I was never an U.S. citizen. I can just\n   pretend that I was never in the USA at all. I could just pretend that I'm\n   just a Mexican kid in need or I can buy a bus ticket to wherever the fuck\n   I'm going. My mom said, \"You can just cross it. Just let an officer catch\n   you trying to cross the border. Try to be as dumb as possible, so they can\n   catch you.\"\n \n \n   Anita: So that they would put you on a bus home.\n \n \n  "
