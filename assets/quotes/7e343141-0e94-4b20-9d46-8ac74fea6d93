  "text":"I do want to go to school. It's been something for the last few\n years. At my last job I had to work, I had a day of like ten and a half\n hours and then I had two-hour commute. So that ate up most of my time, and\n I was just coming home to sleep basically. But I loved my job very much. I\n was like, \u201cOh, I don't need school right now. I'll figure it out\n eventually.\u201d And five years went by and right now I'm like, \u201cThis is kind\n of the perfect job for school because it's so relaxed.\u201d I am off on\n Fridays, I'm off Saturdays. I work from home a lot of days. But it's a lot\n of stuff that I have to ask my parents to do over there to go get my\n documents and stuff apostilled\u2014I think it's called\u2014or certified and then I\n have to translate them.\n      \n      \n Anne: All your education documents or transcripts and all that stuff.\n      \n      \n Brenda: Yes. So, I can eventually go to school here. Then there's this fear\n of like, \"Oh my God, what if I don't get into any of the public schools?\"\n Because I'm like, \"No, I want to go to one of the public universities\" and\n if I don't, that's another cost and now it's like I don't want to leave\n work because I like working and I'd have to do it on the weekends. Then in\n my head, I'm already like, \"Oh my God, am I already not struggling through\n to balance a schedule I don't even have yet.\" I'm just already stressed\n about it [Laughs]. But I do, basically, it's to go back to school because I\n do miss it a lot and I do enjoy it.\n      \n      \n"
