  "text":"Erik: Habits. Like for example the habits of my family. You know? If I stay\n   on my family, and they going to make a party, they might even don't have\n   money and they spend it all. I say, \u201cWhoa whoa whoa whoa, hold your horses.\n   I split the bill.\u201d Or something like that, you know? I don't know if you\n   get me. There's like a cultural thing down there. The city I used to live,\n   it was clean. And you complain about seeing trash on the ground and nobody\n   likes you. I don't know if that makes sense.\n \n \n  "
