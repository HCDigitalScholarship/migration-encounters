  "text":"Mike: And I remember it was me, my mother, my two little brothers\u2014my\n   sisters weren't born at the time\u2014and the two coyotes, the people that cross\n   you. Yeah, I remember that, because that was really, really hard. Just\n   being three days in the desert, especially when you're like three or four,\n   that right there just takes a toll\u2014\n \n \n   Anne: Is that how old you were?\n \n \n   Mike: I was in kindergarten when I crossed the border and, yeah, I remember\n   it was tough. I remember we didn't have any water, and the coyotes had beer\n   and I was so thirsty and they kept telling me, \"No, you don't want this.\n   You don't want this.\" But I was so thirsty, I just took a drink and it was\n   the best thing in life. [Laughs] I think that's why I kind of like it now,\n   but I don't have a problem with it, but...\n \n \n  "
