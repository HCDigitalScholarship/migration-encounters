  "text":"Melani: Well, my dad knew a lot of people that worked in construction and\n   he would always be like, \"Oh, could you get me a job with your employer?\"\n   and they would be like, \"Yes.\" So he would go from one job to another in\n   construction, and it was seasonal, temporary. So it would be for winter\n   months and summer months -- roofing and sheet rocking and stuff like that.\n   Sometimes he would get paid, sometimes he wouldn't get paid, and sometimes\n   he worked in restaurants, but they would always want to pay him less\u2014half\n   of the minimum wage or less.\n \n \n  "
