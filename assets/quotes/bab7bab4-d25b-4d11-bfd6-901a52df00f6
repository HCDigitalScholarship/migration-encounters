Fuck, you guys are killing\n each other for some dumb shit. I didn't want to be part of that.\n [Chuckles].\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Did any of your friends talk about why they did want to join?\n      \n      \n Jesus: I guess to get support or whatever from their other homies. I think\n it was mostly peer pressure for them. That's why they got involved. But for\n me, I was just like, \u201cMan, I don't want to be part of that.\u201d Stayed away\n from that.\n      \n      \n"
