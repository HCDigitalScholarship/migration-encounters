  "text":"Anne: What were your dreams When you were in the US? What were your dreams?\n \n \n   Mike: It's funny as I used to always have a dream of me actually speaking.\n   You know how Martin Luther King did? And this is crazy because I always had\n   this dream every night where I'd be speaking just like him and I'd have\n   crowds just like him. I still feel like I'm going to change society in a\n   positive way.\n \n \n   Mike: I don't know why. I'm just the type of person that I care about\n   everybody. I see the bigger picture, because I used to be selfish and only\n   for myself, but I got my eyes open. I just want to be a help. I want to be\n   the person that I wish I had growing up. That's what I want to do. Whatever\n   it is.\n \n \n  "
