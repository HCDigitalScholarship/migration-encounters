  "text":"ita: So, you said, though, that it was also difficult being undocumented\n and that that contributed to\u2014\n      \n      \n Billy: That pretty much affected my whole life in the U.S. Being somebody\n that spoke perfect English, and I had a lot of good characteristics, but\n just wasn't accepted because of the legal information. Funny story, though,\n one day I was skateboarding on private property. Police came and they\n arrested me. Because me and my friends, we hopped this fence. It was\n basically a school and it had a perfect hill. It looked like a skate park\n almost. So, me and my friends were like, \"Dude, we have to skate this.\"\n      \n      \n Billy: Anyway, we started filming. Police comes and they arrest us and so\n they take my friends' information and whatever and they look for me in the\n system and they can't find me. They were like, \"Mr. S__, we can't find you\n in the system. Where were you born? This doesn't make any sense.\" So, I'm\n like, \"Bro, this is it, this is it. I'm going to Mexico.\" They were like,\n \"Are you native American, sir?\" I'm like, \"Yeah, sure. I'm native\n American.\" \u201cOkay, well, that's fine. You're free to go, sir, don't worry\n about it.\u201d So, that saved my butt. The English and the way I looked saved\n my butt a lot.\n      \n      \n Anita: And your name.\n      \n      \n Billy: And the name, too, probably had something to do with it, yeah.\n      \n      \n A"
