  "text":"Yosell: Let's see, snowboarding. I would always go back out to Utah, to\n   Salt Lake, cause I loved snowboarding there and plus we'd always get free\n   gear out there from the sponsor. The best part I probably like out there\n   was camping out in the mountains. I really like camping a lot, I don't know\n   why, it's just something I always did like. [Chuckle]. And from surfing, I\n   don't know, it was always really into water.\n \n \n  "
