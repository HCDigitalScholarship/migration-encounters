  "text":"Ilse: I was angry when I had to go to the US because I had everything here,\n   you know? And then, I was so angry because they took me over there, and I\n   tried so hard, and I wanted to stay over there, and I had to come back.\n   I've had to change. I'm not trying to be like, \"Oh, poor me,\" and people\n   feel pity for me or anything at all, but it's just like, why can't a person\n   just live, and be where they want to be? That just gets to me. It\u2019s not\n   like I'm mad at the US, or I'm mad at my parents because they took me, I'm\n   just mad that people have to go through that, you know? Just to run away\n   from things, as kids. Because I know there's millions and thousands,\n   thousands, of kids that have to do what their parents tell them. But I'm\n   happy in Mexico, I can tell you that. It was probably the best decision\n   that I could have made. I don't know what would have happened if I had\n   stayed over there. Who knows?\n \n \n   Ilse: But I think it was a good decision, and mainly because I was so\n   dedicated, and I always knew what I wanted, and I worked so hard for it. I\n   didn't give up. I think that's the difference. And bumping into so many\n   amazing people who have been there for me, who have helped me. Like my boss\n   right now, sometimes he's kind of like my dad, you know? He knows my story,\n   and he helps me so much, and he tells me, \"You're going to see your parents\n   again, and I'm going to make sure, and I'm going to help you, and I don't\n   know what we're going to have to do, but you're going to see them again.\"\n \n \n  "
