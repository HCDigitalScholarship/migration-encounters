What are they talking about?\n   What do they see in me that I don't see in myself?\" And it sucked because\n   other people looked at my potential and I put myself so low that I didn't\n   even look at that. Every time they're like, \"Dude, you've got so much\n   potential.\" And I'm like, \"Yeah, right dude, what are you talking about?\n   You just trying to butter me up man.\"\n \n \n  "
