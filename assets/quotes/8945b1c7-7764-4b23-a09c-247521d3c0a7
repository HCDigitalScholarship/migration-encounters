  "text":"Anne: So, when did you first go to juvey? How old were you?\n \n \n   Hugo: I was 14. The thing is when you grow up and you feel like you were\n   born there\u2014my dad used to tell us, \"I don't know you guys are in the street\n   all day. I mean you guys have your home here, you can eat whenever you\n   want, you can shower whenever you want, listen to music whenever you want.\"\n   But that was boring to us. So, we would go into the street. There was three\n   of us. Three brothers. And we'd go into the street, kick it in the alleys,\n   you know like people do over there.\n \n \n   Hugo: We started hanging with certain people, you know? And things\n   happened, they come around with G-rides, stolen cars, things like that. And\n   it seems easy for you to take a joy ride, \u201cOh we'll take it over there to\n   certain people's houses.\u201d You get caught up. That's the first time I got\n   caught. I didn't steal the car. Somebody came by, I took it, but it was a\n   stolen car. I knew what I was doing, so they locked me up for grand theft\n   auto or receiving stolen property or what not.\n \n \n  "
