  "text":"Anne: Did you do well in school?\n \n \n   Juan: Yes. Even though English was a struggle, I always tried my best, and\n   when I was in middle school, I would get As and Bs. Then, when I was in\n   high school, like I mentioned, I was on the soccer team, which required for\n   you to have good grades in order to play. I really liked soccer, so that\n   encouraged me to keep my grades up to be able to play for the soccer team.\n   So yes, I did have good grades, you can say.\n \n \n   Anne: What position do you play?\n \n \n   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got\n   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I\n   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer\u2014my cousin who lives here\n   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just\n   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and\n   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were\n   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,\n   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about\n   it.\n \n \n  "
