  "text":"Anne: So do you think that you are different having been to the US for\n   those years? How did it change you?\n \n \n   Laura: They changed me. I believe if I have stayed here in Mexico, probably\n   I would never learn English. Probably, I would not have the opportunity\n   that I have right now to travel to any other places because I like to\n   travel a lot.\n \n \n   Laura: So, when I try to compare myself with my friends, with my friends\n   that we left in Iguala, what I see is that they didn't have the opportunity\n   that I have, like to learn things, to meet some new culture, to meet\n   people. Like they didn't have that opportunity. They stayed in that place,\n   and they were absorbed by the violence, by the narco traffic, and\n   everything. What I think is that I was really lucky. Kind of lucky because\n   some things got complicated, but some things were really an experience, and\n   they were a nice experience.\n \n \n   Laura: I learn a lot from people from the US. They have a different\n   culture, a different, like, you know, thinking. They don't think poorly.\n   Always one more, and in Mexico we don't have that mentality.\n \n \n  "
