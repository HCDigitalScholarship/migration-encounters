  "text":"ita: So, I'm going to ask you both these questions. In what way do you\n feel American?\n      \n      \n Billy: The fact that I understand the culture. The fact that I grew up in\n African American neighborhoods and lived the whole American experience. Not\n just that but I had friends from all over. Friends from Cuba, living in\n Miami. From Columbia. Then I had Asian friends, white friends, black\n friends. I got into the skateboarding culture which really introduced me to\n a big part of American life. Going out and filming with your friends.\n Learning jazz music showed me the history of the U.S. and why African\n American history is so important\u2014it really, in a way, shaped what the U.S.\n is.\n      \n      \n Billy: And so, in those ways I consider myself American. Just those\n experiences. But blood-wise, I'm Mexicano [Anita laughs]. Culturally and in\n terms of my roots I'm Mexican. I've been exposed to the tacos al pastor. I\n would give my friends Agua de Jamaica in the U.S. and they were like, \"Man,\n what is this, bro? Man, what is this juice?\" I'm like, \"Bro, this is not\n juice it's a plant.\" It's like, \"Man, this is good, bro. I got to buy\n this.\" And stuff like that. I've been exposed to the Mexican culture, yeah.\n And, of course, living in LA, Mexican culture's everywhere there. Think of\n it.\n      \n      \n A"
