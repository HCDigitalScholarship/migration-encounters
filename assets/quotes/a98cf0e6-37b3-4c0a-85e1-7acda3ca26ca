  "text":"Jose: Yeah. Actually, my brother's in jail right now. Yeah, I feel like he\n   was the one that was traumatized the most. After he was eight, nine, ten\n   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if\n   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because\n   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working. I\n   started getting my head straight. I was being mentored by older people. I\n   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should\n   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a\n   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and\n   stuff.\n \n \n   Jose: So while my brother was going through his stuff, I tried to mentor\n   him a lot, but it was always... It went in one ear and it came out the\n   other. I had struggled myself so I understood where he was coming from. And\n   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told\n   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned\n   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since\n   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was\n   doing, but I was going to tell him what could happen down the line. And\n   eventually, it did. He was getting locked up. He was like 16, 17 being\n   brought home by the police for doing whatever now.\n \n \n  "
