  "text":"Juan: When I had first come back, my plan was to graduate from college and\n   go back to the US, because that's where I feel happy, but that's no longer\n   my vision. I want to stay here, I want to help out my country because I\n   love Mexico. I love the culture, I love the people. But unfortunately,\n   because of the politics, the corruption, Mexico isn't so well. I know me,\n   as an individual, I can make an impact on society, on the communities. I\n   know that with my career as an architect I can make it happen.\n \n \n  "
