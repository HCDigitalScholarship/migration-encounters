  "text":"Axel: Over here, everybody looks the same, really. You can't really tell\n who's into the narcs, who's into some heavy drugs, who's into just being\n calm, who's maybe undercover police, something like that. Over here, it's\n like you can't really get mad at anybody on the streets, can't go off on\n them, can't really argue with them because that person could just be\n involved with somebody higher up or could be involved with the narcs, the\n little gangs that there is around the areas and all right, so now you mess\n with that person, so they already know where you work, they know you're\n around this area all the time. They'll come and get you the next day or\n they'll go away, come back with some friends and they'll mess with you, or\n like they said about the food stuff or they'll come and pick you up in a\n truck, they'll kidnap you for a while, torture you and just go and kidnap\n you just for fun. Just to leave you in the room and not eat for a couple\n days.\n      \n      \n Axel: It's never happened to me, but it's happened to my coworkers and\n stuff and they've missed work one or two days and they're about to get\n fired and they come back, and then they're like, \"Man, I was kidnapped. I\n didn't have no form of communication or anything, I was kidnapped for the\n past two days.\" All they ask for at work, because they know that it happens\n and there is no way for them to prove it, really, there's no way for you to\n prove it either so all they ask for you to do is at least go make the\n report with the police."
