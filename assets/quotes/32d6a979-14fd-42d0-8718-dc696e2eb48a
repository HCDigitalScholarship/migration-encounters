  "text":"And\n   since my father's deportation process was still\u2014we were still going through\n   that as well. I just had to go with my mom to a couple of hearings with her\n   and translate what they were saying and all of the information and all of\n   that.\n \n \n   Lizzy: So, you were in charge of translating for your mom?\n \n \n   Laila: Yeah.\n \n \n   Lizzy: They didn't provide any sort of translator?\n \n \n   Laila: Oh, no, they didn't even really care about the people there.\n \n \n   Lizzy: What was that like as a, you're still a child at that point, having\n   to act as a translator in a high-stress situation like that? What was that\n   like for you?\n \n \n   Laila: It was scary for me, thinking that we were that close to a police\n   officer. It came to the point where I was scared of the police, completely.\n   I couldn't even trust them with, I don't know, an emergency or something\n   because I knew that they might ask me for papers and I would be completely,\n   I don't know, done at that point. I was actually my parent's translator\n   since I was very young. They didn't have a lot of time to learn English,\n   they just decided to work. So, since I was a child, I would always go with\n   them into stores or places where they needed an English speaker, and I\n   would do that for them."
