  "text":"Axel: Yeah. They're like, \"We're going to give you a misdemeanor instead of\n a felony for the assault charge with the teacher since you already failed\n your probation. Since you're a minor, we understand you did try to do your\n probation.\" He's like, \"Look, we're going to put you here in this juvenile\n for two years. While you're in there, they're going to be giving you\n therapy sessions for anger management.\" He's like, \"They also talk about\n drug abusement, but it's a whole class so it's like a whole therapy class,\n so they talk about a whole bunch of stuff, but they'll also give you your\n personal sessions also to help you with your issues.\"\n      \n      \n"
