  "text":"esus: It makes me miss it somewhat because it was really nice. Life over\n there is super nice. You can't compare to living here. Everything's fucked\n up over here unfortunately. [Laughs]. It's a super nice country. Everything\n is beautiful, but everything is corrupt, and cops are assholes, people\n sometimes are assholes. There's a lot of drugs, a lot of violence.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Have any cartels or drugs tried to approach you, or have you had any\n experiences with them since you've been back?\n      \n      \n Jesus: The thing about the cartels is they're not really here in the city.\n They're mostly more south or more up north, because right here is where\n it's more controlled actually. That's what I'm learning. Right here in the\n city, it's mostly controlled, so the cartels don't come in here that much.\n Or if they do, it's low key. You don't really know about them.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: So that's not something you've had to deal with?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Nah. I had to deal with the casual guy that doesn't have nothing\n else to do but rob, steal.\n      \n      \n Lizzy: Have you gotten robbed?\n      \n      \n Jesus: They tried, but they didn't succeed. [Laughs].\n      \n      \n"
