  "text":"Luis: She greeted me in one of those horrible, no-one-knows-the-name-of-\n   cities of Durango, so we just bought some tickets and we went into Mexico\n   City. I remember at the time that I saw her, she just started crying\n   because she said, \u201cLook at how big you are. You look so handsome.\" And I\n   was like this. I didn't know what to say. She started crying and she said,\n   \"I'm so sorry that he had to die for us to get back together. I'm sorry\n   that my father had to die. I'm so sorry.\" But that was it. That was pretty\n   much it. That's the story of how I got back in here and it's just that\n   knowing that I'm never going to have the chance of saying sorry I\u2014\n \n \n  "
