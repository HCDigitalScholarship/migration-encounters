  "text":"Isabel: Do you think weed is just something to relax here and have fun, or\n   do you think it gives you a break from where you are?\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, it can do both, depending also on the person. Every person's\n   body is different. Every person takes it different. Me, I actually take it\n   to relax me. Sometimes I actually just take it just to have fun, relax and\n   chill, depending on the moment. There are days I work when I get so\n   frustrated I just need to smoke to just relax my mind where I'm just like,\n   \"All right, I'm cool.\" Because it brings me to where, \"Fuck it. It was just\n   a phone call. It was his job. Fuck \u2018em. It is what it is.\" And then when\n   I'm with friends, we're just like, \"Oh yeah, let's smoke. Just laughs.\"\n   Right there it's just haha, giggles, laughs, you're just clowning on\n   people.\n \n \n   Isabel: Everything's funny.\n \n \n   Weco: Yeah, everything's funny. You're just roasting. And I'm one of those.\n   I get to roasting everybody. I just like to have fun. So, yeah. sometimes I\n   do use weed to get my depression out.\n \n \n   Isabel: Yeah.\n \n \n   Weco: Sometimes it comes around when you get depressed being out here on\n   your own. But like I said, I just smoke. When I smoke, it goes away. My\n   mentality switches to, \"Look, you're on your own. Why suffer? Why cry?\" My\n   mentality just switches quick, and I stop being depressed about it. It is\n   what it is."
