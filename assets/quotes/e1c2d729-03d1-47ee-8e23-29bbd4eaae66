  "text":"Anne: So a couple of things to reflect on. When we talked to young men\n   similar to you who went as children and parents were working in the US\n   while they're growing up, a lot of them turned to gangs and criminal\n   behavior. You did not.\n \n \n   Juan: No.\n \n \n   Anne: What do you think the difference was?\n \n \n   Juan: I don't know. I guess some people\u2026 I would say my dad, he provided me\n   with the role model. Because I told you, my dad is a hardworking man. Since\n   we were little, we were nine or ten, he would make us go to work with him,\n   even on the weekends, even if we would just go and pick up trash or even\n   just to be there, he would make us go. In the way he taught us, that if you\n   want something you have to go out and do it. No one is going to get it for\n   you.\n \n \n   Juan: In my situation, my dad was a role model and he made it so gang\n   affiliation or violence never came to my head. I had cousins. One of my\n   cousins was gang affiliated and he is older than me for two years or three\n   years, so I saw that he was in a gang and he had a lot of friends and, in a\n   way, it did push me to want to be like him because I saw him, he had power,\n   but I always knew that gang affiliation wasn't my thing.\n \n \n   Juan: Because, again, through sports, school, my dad, going to work, that\n   helped me not get into that. I guess people who do get in gangs, I don't\n   know if they feel alone or they feel by being in a gang you have a new\n   family who has your back. That could also have them go towards a gang\n   affiliation. You don't know their background as a house, if their parents\n   are not well, or if they had a dad who was abusive or a mom who was\n   abusive.\n \n \n   Juan: A lot of things come from home when it comes to gang affiliation, or\n   the people that you hang out with, the people that you surround yourself\n   with. Fortunately, I was surrounding myself with good people who came from\n   good families and showed me different things in life that didn't have to do\n   with gang affiliation. When I was in high school, there was a lot of people\n   who were in gangs. I was friends with them, but to the point where I wanted\n   to be in their gang or affiliated with them that just didn't come to my\n   mind.\n \n \n  "
