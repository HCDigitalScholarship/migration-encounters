  "text":"Anita: So, have you become aware of any programs that help returning\n   migrants?\n \n \n   Jesus: Yeah. I went with Israel to some meeting where it was like all the\n   other big programs that actually help people out. And it was kind of\n   amazing to see that there was like nine or ten different people\n   representing their own associations and stuff.\n \n \n   Anita: So, these were sort of non-governmental programs, or were they...?\n \n \n   Jesus: As far as I know, yeah. Non-governmental.\n \n \n   Anita: Okay. What kind of programs? Do you know what they were about? Do\n   you remember their names?\n \n \n   Jesus: I know a few of them. I don't know them by name. But I know some of\n   them were centered towards helping women returning, some of them were just\n   centered towards helping migrants from southern countries.\n \n \n   Anita: Sort of economically, psychologically...?\n \n \n   Jesus: Yeah, just everything. Pretty much what New Comienzos does, but ours\n   is more centered towards United States returnees and deportees. Some of\n   these were more centered towards the specifics, like just women, women\n   abused, stuff like that. So, that was pretty cool.\n \n \n  "
