  "text":"Ivan: Yeah. I tried. I tried. But the photography business here, it's so\n   different. It's so different. I still deal with Mexican people, but it was\n   so different. It was so different. The culture here, most of the people who\n   hire photographers, they have the ways to afford it. And most of the people\n   here in Mexico City who have some higher or really high\u2026 they have money,\n   they're really bad people. I went to a few weddings here. People would\n   treat me like you were the worst. Yeah. Photographers here, especially who\n   do weddings and Quincea\u00f1eras, they get treated really bad.\n \n"
