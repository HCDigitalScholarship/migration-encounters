  "text":"Anne: If you could change immigration law in the US, how would you change\n it?\n      \n      \n Brenda: I don't know. I think it's just tough because I don't think it can\n be\u2014what is it they call it\u2014like a blanket solution of \u201cokay, let everyone\n go through\u201d or \u201cgive everyone automatic resident status\u201d or whatever. I\n remember there was a few things that I saw I think when John, I forgot his\n name, was really opposing Obama during his second re-election. But a lot of\n things that I saw were like, \u201cOh you have to go through schooling.\u201d\n      \n      \n Anne: John McCain?\n      \n      \n Brenda: Not John McCain\u2014maybe I'm thinking of George W. Bush the second\n time he went through. But I remember it was a lot of like, \u201cOh, the men\n going through a military training or going through school or making sure\n that you've gone all these years without any law-breaking and stuff.\u201d I was\n like, \u201cThat's fair because most immigrants are trying to stay out of\n trouble.\u201d I can attest to being scared of \u2026 \u201cNo, we have to be sure that\n we're good and making sure going to school or getting a job\u201d and I think\n that's just normal basic things to ask for.\n      \n      \n Brenda: But I think those would have been great. It's harder now. I don't\n see the appeal right now in the US, sometimes it's a struggle because of\n how the political climate has been going since I left. I left when Obama\n had just gotten into the White House. So, it was really hard to see that\n transition completely the last few years. But I definitely think a system\n has to come up because I feel like it keeps getting pushed aside. We'll do\n it later, we'll do it later. Definitely for the people in the DACA program\n now that they've never known anything else.\n      \n      \n Brenda: I think I would've loved it if I had gotten that opportunity or\n hadn't left before it was installed into place."
