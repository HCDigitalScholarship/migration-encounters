My\n   friends were working all the time. I guess nobody like, could supervise me.\n   Yeah, I had bad influences. I hung out with the wrong crowd and I guess I\n   had no purpose for going to school. I said, \"Why am I even going to\n   school?\" I didn't even know. I didn't even like see a reason, a good reason\n   to go. So it's like it didn't matter to me.\n \n \n  "
