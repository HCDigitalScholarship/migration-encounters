  "text":"Yair: What I miss over there also is just most of the time the lifestyle,\n   because I lived over there in a small country, a small town, and I could do\n   anything. I could go fishing, I could go to a lake, play basketball, really\n   anything, like going to the woods. I miss all that. Basically you can find\n   the same thing here in Mexico, but it's not the same as over there.\n \n \n  "
