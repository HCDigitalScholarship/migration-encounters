  "text":"I learned English in California.\n \n \n     Anita:\n \n \n     How?\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad\n     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was\n     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody\n     was like, \"The new guy\" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And\n     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL\n     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I\n     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had\n     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that\n     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was\n     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class\n     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling\n     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts\n     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. \"Huh?\n     Okay.\" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. \"Okay. I heard about him.\"\n     But then the language, I just heard the teacher going, \"Blah, blah, blah,\n     blah, blah.\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     Okay and I understood \u201cAbraham Lincoln,\u201d and that\u2019s all. \"Abraham Lincoln.\"\n     \"Good. What about him?\" Yes. It was difficult. Math? I didn't talk at all.\n     I was good at math because I learned \u2013here in Mexico, they're very good at\n     math and still they are very good at math. My algebra teacher \u2013 It was a\n     Chicano girl. I remember that Chicano girl. The teacher pointed at me for\n     something and then the girl told me, \"Hey he's calling you. The teacher is\n     calling you.\" She said that in Spanish. \"Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?\n     What does he want me to do?\" \"He wants you to go to the board and complete\n     the mathematic there.\u201d\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     \"Just go try to do it.\" She actually translated for the teacher, so I just\n     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.\n     The teacher was like, \"How do you do it? You got to show me how you do it.\n     How'd you get that result?\" When he looked at me with those surprised eyes\n     I was like, \"Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call\n     my parents.\" Then the girl says, the translator said, \"How do you do it?\"\n     \"Because that's how I learned to do it.\" \"Where do you learn to do it? He's\n     asking where you-\" \"Mexico.\" \"He wants you to teach him how you did that.\"\n     \"Well, this, this goes like this and you go like that\". \"But how come you\n     don't put anything on the board? How come you don't write anything? How\n     come you just put the answer?\"\n \n \n     Beto:\n \n \n     \"Because in Mexico you just got to do the math in your head. My teachers\n     will get mad if I do the math on the board. They don't like you to do\n     that.\" Here, now this is different from my times. If you do a subtraction,\n     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,\n     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do\n     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the\n     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,\n     \"Okay, I'll teach you guys more. This guy is crazy.\" I remember when he\n     called me crazy, \"This guy is crazy, how come he did this? I'll show you\n     guys how to do this.\"\n \n \n    "
