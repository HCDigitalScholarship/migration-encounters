I didn't\n   have enough money, because I feel like over here when people know that\n   you're not from here\u2014or that you're from over there\u2014they take advantage.\n   And I feel like my dad kind of took advantage of me. He basically said that\n   things were one price, but they were totally different.\n \n \n   Anne: Your dad? The one who kidnapped you?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah.\n \n \n  "
