  "text":"Anne: Did you ever get in trouble with like gangs or anything like that?\n \n \n   Many: No. Actually, (where we lived) it's a nice small town where it's not\n   too much violence there. It's not too many people. So, no, I never related\n   with gangs and everything because I was too young when I got married, so I\n   didn't have time. I knew people they were related with these kind of gangs\n   and groups, but I just talk to them for a little bit and then that's it. I\n   never get into a gang or something. I like tattoos. You can see. I love\n   tattoos because I like to draw a lot. I like tattoo too.\n \n \n   Anne: You can do it yourself?\n \n \n   Many: Yeah, some of them. Yes ma'am.\n \n \n  "
