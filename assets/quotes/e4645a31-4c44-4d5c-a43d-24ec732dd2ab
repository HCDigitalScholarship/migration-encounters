  "text":"Once I moved with him, he moved about two blocks\n down just to another apartment where it was bigger space, where I could\n stay with him and from there, we never moved again. That's when I started\n doing from like seventh grade, all the way up till I finished my last six\n years.\n      \n      \n Axel: Half of it, mom was everywhere and then the other half, I was in a\n stable location where I actually met the friends that I have now that still\n talk to me now that I'm here and that still help me whenever they can. I\n don't even have to ask them, they'll just tell me, \"Hey, right now I'm\n going to send you some money or I'm going to do this, I'm going to give\n your kids something, where can I meet them? Blah, blah, blah.\" I know that\n they're going to help me, but I don't like to ask them because it's not\n something that I don't really like to ask them for, for stuff because I\n know it's not their fault that I got deported or anything like that.\n      \n      \n"
