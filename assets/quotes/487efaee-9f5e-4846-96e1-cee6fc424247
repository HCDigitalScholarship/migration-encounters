  "text":"Lizzy: So, you did look into applying for DACA?\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah, but I wasn't able to. I was like, \u201cI can't even do that so\n ...\u201d\n      \n      \n Lizzy: That's really frustrating.\n      \n      \n Jesus: Yeah. Then I didn't see a future for myself over there because of\n all of that, and I didn't have paperwork. I did have a good job; I was\n getting paid good. But even that was unsure because I was kind of not doing\n it legally. [Chuckles]. So, everything, my life was unsure at that point. I\n had my own house, I was paying rent, all of that. Even so, I didn't see a\n future, because I was like, \u201cWhen am I going to get a house by myself, all\n this mortgage and loans and debt? I don't have paperwork. I don't have a\n secure job and all that shit. I'm not going to make it here. Even if I\n wanted to, it's going to be super hard. It's going to be double the time\n and I have to pay lawyers, whatever.\u201d So, I was like, \u201cI'll head over to\n Mexico.\u201d Plus, I have land here.\n      \n      \n"
