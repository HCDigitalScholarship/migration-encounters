It's because I would always hang out with the older people\n   since I always looked older. I was in middle school going to high school,\n   ditching, parties, and you know messing around with high school girls and\n   all of that stuff. And that's when you run into the police. They would take\n   me to truancy center when I would ditch sometimes, and they would catch us.\n   Things like that.\n \n \n  "
