  "text":"Anne: So after your son was born you did not stay with the young woman, and\n   she kept the baby and you just visited him?\n \n \n   Mike: No, no, no. I got us an apartment. I was working, I had gotten a car\n   and the thing was crazy because everything started working out all by\n   itself. I feel like it was blessing, after blessing, after blessing. And at\n   that time, that's when I was getting my work permit. I got my social. That\n   was all at that time. So I was able to provide for my kids. I was able to\n   provide for the mother of my kids.\n \n \n   Anne: You have more than one kid?\n \n \n   Mike: Yeah. I have two kids.\n \n \n   Mike: Same mother. Oh yeah, we had that kid because she was pregnant\n   before, but she had a miscarriage. Or, I don't know what they call it, but\n   the baby died in the womb.\n \n \n   Anne: A still born baby?\n \n \n   Mike: It was alive, but I think the [Exhale], hospitals since they\n   didn't\u2014you know when babies are really young, it takes money to take care\n   of them?\n \n \n   Anne: Premature?\n \n \n   Mike: Well he was six months and her water broke. He was still alive and\n   they told us that they could take him out, but he was going to have\n   problems. So they made us feel like he wasn't going to survive, and they\n   let him die in the womb.\n \n \n   Mike: And then when we found out, we tried to put a lawsuit on them, but it\n   was too late. But they felt bad. They still feel bad, because every year\n   they send us cards, all the nurses and staff. So I know they did something\n   wrong. I know they did.\n \n \n   Anne: That was the second pregnancy?\n \n \n   Mike: That was the second pregnancy, but since that went wrong, the mother\n   of my kids just got like depressed. Have you heard of a rainbow child? It's\n   when you have a kid after the first one passed away.\n \n \n   Mike: So that was our rainbow child, Eli, and that's when I started going\n   downhill, because my stuff got denied. I didn't have the privileges that\n   every normal US citizen gets to have. So I had two kids, no way to provide\n   for them.\n \n \n  "
