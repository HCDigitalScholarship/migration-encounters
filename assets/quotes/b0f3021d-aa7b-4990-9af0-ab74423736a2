  "text":"Jesus: Well, I like art. I like a lot of art. I like painting and creating\n things. I wanted to be an engineer because I think it would be really good,\n good help to society, make things a lot easier and better, more creative.\n The transportation system here sucks. It's good, because you can get it\n anywhere at any time, but it's contaminating the whole city. So, I gotta\n make some other things change. I think I would be able to help in that kind\n of sense, if I was to know all the engineering part of it.\n      \n      \n"
