  "text":"Zayuri: I don't want to say that I gave up, but I did thought, \"Okay, I'm\n   just going to work and try to get into college here, do college here, and\n   then try to get there,\" because it was a struggle even to pay the college\n   in here in pesos. So, I can't imagine having to pay a loan to pay the\n   college in the United States. I was thinking of that, just finishing\n   college in here and trying to go legally back there.\n \n \n  "
