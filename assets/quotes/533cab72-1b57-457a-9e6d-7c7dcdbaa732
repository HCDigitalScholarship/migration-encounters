  "text":"Ilse: First of all, from the experience of being at the border\u2026Because they\n   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to\n   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,\n   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can\n   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part\n   of the border. Help people in the border.\n \n \n   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican\n   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, \"Oh, you're about to do something\n   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you\n   from doing it.\" Why not change that speech? Why not say, \"Don't leave. How\n   can we help you so you won't leave?\" I mean, we could fix a problem from\n   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze\n   the people, make a profile\u2014there's a lot of people that are being deported\n   that have so much knowledge.\n \n \n  "
