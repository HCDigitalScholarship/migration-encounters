  "text":"Many: Yeah, it's hard. It's hard to live like that because my dream, when I\n   crossed the border, was have a good life, try to change my life. But after\n   that, I didn't regret it but I think would be better if I would stay in\n   Mexico because, I don't know how I explain to you, the reason that I\n   crossed the border, I was trying to change something in my life. Something\n   that I don't have when I was here in Mexico, but when I went to San\n   Antonio, what I found it was just... How you call it? How do you say? It\n   was not what I want. I lost my family, I've lost a few years of my life.\n \n \n  "
