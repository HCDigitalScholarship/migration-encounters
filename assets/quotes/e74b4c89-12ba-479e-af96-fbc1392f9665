  "text":"Jesus: That's a really good question. Well, for me, it was mostly I didn't\n even know I was going over there, so everything was just interesting.\n [Chuckles] Then once I got there, life was difficult for me being an\n immigrant, especially because I did it illegally. If I had done it legally,\n I think it would've been much easier, and I would've probably done a lot\n better, had a lot of things to look forward to and stuff. But I guess, just\n open your mind. Just to be open to people, not judge a book by its cover.\n If you get to know them, you might know that they have other things that\n are better. Do you want to better yourself, better the world, better\n everybody? It's hard. It's hard when you don't have access to things. A lot\n of people need support. A lot of people have good ideas, good intentions.\n They just need that support.\n      \n      \n"
