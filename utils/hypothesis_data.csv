 didn't pick me up or arrest me, but since they came looking for me, they
 left their card there. And so, I voluntarily went in, but I knew something
 happened, so I grabbed my driver's license, my social security card and I
 tucked it away. So, I go into the offices and immediately they put me on a
 pretty high, outrageous bond and—

 then there they told me I was under arrest and then they shipped me to
 Lorado. And I go before a judge in Lorado, and I go to fight this. I'm
 going to have to sit here two years or pay $50,000 bond. And I go, ""No,” so
 I just told the judge. I had an attorney, we had hired an attorney, but the

 a mistake, we could've won. But I did not want to sit there for two years

 courses that you took, were they designed to help you with your business?
 Did you think about that?
      
      
 Ben: Yes. The courses that I started taking were courses that I figured
 would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For
 instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of
 the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--
 definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance
 because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real
 estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor
 in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,
 but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in
 Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the
 opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that
 much capital to be able to take that much more on.

 the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines
 of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and
 free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all
 the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and
 trigonometry. I taught those at our private school, where my kids went to,

 had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have

   lot of business with China, and we import 80% of the things that we have in

   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this—they
   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal
   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some

   information on me because I got stopped going to work. It was really early,
   and we, the other guys that were with me, were about to leave the apartment

   people that were looking to buy a house for the first time. And I was doing
   quite well until I couldn't do it anymore because, since I was
   undocumented, I couldn't renew my driver's license. And when you don't have
   a license in the state of Texas, pretty much you can't do anything. You
   cannot travel, you cannot open a bank account, you cannot do pretty much
   anything. You can't go to a bank and do anything because you don't have
   identification. And the worst part was that in my business I needed to
   notarize documents, I needed to borrow money from banks to purchase the
   houses, and I needed a credit card to buy my materials to remodel my houses
   and all that stuff. And since I didn't have anything like that, I couldn't
   do nothing anymore, absolutely nothing. And it was a very, very hard time

   get there, you get there usually with no money, usually in need of

   know how to drive commercial vehicles, I was able to get a job driving a
   vehicle and I drove a bobtail truck, delivering gasoline and diesel. And I
   did that for a long time. And I took many driving jobs because of the
   commercial license that I used to have. I used to have several jobs driving
   commercial vehicles. But then when I got married, my wife didn't want me to
   do anymore that job because it was kind of dangerous. So I stopped doing

   in total a year and three months. I got out on bond. I went to my two
   immigration court dates. First one, they denied me. By the second one, my
   son was already born. So, my lawyer fought for it. He was like, ""His first
   time being a father,"" this and that. ""Give him an opportunity."" They did.
   They gave me a bond, $8,000, so I paid it.
 
 
   Weco: I was out for a year, then going to a party, hanging out with the
   friends, I got into a fight. Things happened. Luckily, I was the only one
   known there at that place. It was like if we go to a party, they just know
   me. This person got really messed up, ended up in the hospital. Three weeks
   later I found out I got a warrant for my arrest. I looked up, I called my
   lawyer and was like, ""Hey, what's going on?"" He's like, ""For a fight. Best
   thing to do is turn yourself in. You got a record of escaping."" As a minor,
   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee
   under their eyes.
 
 
   Weco: So, he's like, ""Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will
   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.""
   So I was like, ""All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I
   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too."" He's
   like, ""All right.""
 
 
   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.
   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,
   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then
   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.

   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.
 
 
   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?
 
 
   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on
   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a
   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not
   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing
   we was going to get to, I said, ""All right. We finna get off the freeway.

   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal
   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going
   to have to catch me."" That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with
   the wrong one.”
 
 
   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?
 
 
   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was
   like, ""Man, it's now or never."" So, I just went ahead and got up. First
   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.
   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the
   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was
   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab
   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went
   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,
   ""What am I doing?"" I'm like, ""Man, I just made this worse."" So, I was like,
   ""I might as well just complete with it.""
 
 
   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?
 
 
   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I
   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, ""I
   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it."" So, I just
   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,
   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through
   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.

   ear and they're like, ""What is that?"" And I was like, ""Aw damn, I'm done.""

   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next
   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.
   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I
   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out
   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going
   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.
 
 
   Mike: So they were like, ""Dude, you got to do something. You either going
   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to
   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do
   a voluntary departure and you go."" At that time I felt like I wasn't any
   good to anybody. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family."" So I just
   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran
   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was

   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just

   on him. I would treat him like the parent that I never had who wanted to be
   back in my life. So you know you could kind of treat him like however you
   want? That's how I would treat him. And I just started realizing over time
   my dad just—this guy really cares about us. He's providing for five kids
   and still doesn't ask for anything.
 
 
   Mike: It just started growing on me and we started getting along and it
   started getting better. But yeah, I would not get along with my mom, or my
   dad at all. And my mom was—I feel like a lot of Mexican women and men, they
   have something against black folks even if you want to or not. I feel like
   that's racist too, because my mom would always be like, ""Why do you hang
   out with them? Why do you do this? Why do you do that?""
 
 
   Mike: I'm like, ""Because they're cool, man. They're like... I feel like
   these are my people. They've gone through the same struggles, a lot of the
   same stuff that happened to them. They would happen to me."" So I would
   always bring them over, and I remember one time my mom got so mad she
   grabbed an orange and threw it at my friend, but my friend was so tall, he
   just caught it.
 
 
   Mike: These were kids from Nigeria. They're African—these guys are like,
   ""Whoa."" So he caught it and then he just said hi to my mom. My mom was so
   mad that day, man. I didn't come home for like two or three days just
   because of that. I got a lot of stories. I'm sorry I get out of track.

 things to do. In religion, all the religions teach the same thing. Love one
 another, peace. So why can't all of them be just one religion? But, no.
 It's just separation. It's just changing separation, having to unify people
 when everybody's already separated, they've been like that for decades,
 takes a lot of people. I think the solution to that would be just unifying
 the country, and making that one goal, one human goal. The one goal that
 every human could have, and everybody could have access to food and shelter
 and stuff, but based on wanting the people to grow, want their knowledge to
 grow, because more people put their minds on one thing. It's easier for it
 to be done, it's proven. You get five people to flip a car over, they'll do
 it. If one person tries, they're never going to do it. So just changing
 everybody's mindsets and having the opportunity for everybody to live
 correctly, I think that would make a better world. It would help everybody
 use their minds for other things than just work. They could use it for
 their creative sides where they could start creating things that could help

 have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody
 should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read
 the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And
 I just feel like somebody could have said, ""Well, hold on, this makes no
 sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened."" But it was never,
 ""Okay, what happened?"" It was always, ""Okay, you did this."" So that's where
 I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had
 no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the
 bad guy because a little baby got hurt.
      
      
 Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were
 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,
 ""You know what, he did something,"" it was, ""You're going to jail,"" just
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, ""There's no way that I'm
 going to get past this."" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was
 not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was
 different, I was completely—
      
      
 Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through
 things in jail of all these things, I told myself, ""Why are you here then?
 You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why
 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing
 for some time?"" I was like, ""Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going
 to go home, you're going to see your mom."" And then out of nowhere you get
 this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, ""No, no, no, no,
 no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No."" And so it
 was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.
 The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation
 that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all
 I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not
 being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or
 recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very
 hard.

 you consider yourself Mexican or American?

 Isabel: Why do you think that is?
      
      
 Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking
 around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].
 So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I
 talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I
 guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it
 and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and
 down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't
 belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and
 I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much
 all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all
 that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal
 ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in
 America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was
 some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped

 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""

 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""

 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.

 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""

 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself

 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

12838,text,42820,47400,"Isabel: Yeah. I understand how you would really not want to ask anything
 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for
 detention for two months?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes.
      
      
 Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the
 treatment you experienced there?
      
      
 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""
      
      
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And

 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own

 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the

 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?

 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my

 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.

 back onto the bed and then that—

 got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.

12848,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
","Time in the US, Relationships, Having Children,  Complications, Break-ups, Domestic Abuse, Violence, Feelings, Despair, Tragedy, Arrests, False Accusations",Angelo
12849,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years

 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all

 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.

 But I ended up being deported.

",Lack of mental health resources,Angelo

 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I

 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",conflict,Angelo
12851,text,9192,15590,"Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.

 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.

 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get

 still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had
 to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending
 because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left
 alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many
 times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or
 I would have a friend that said, ""Let's go do this,"" I'll be, ""No, I'm
 going to get in trouble."" Or, ""No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from
 here."" And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had
 Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that
 were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was
 always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, ""Oh I
 have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback."" And so that was
 very, very, very difficult for me.

 what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody
 what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and
 that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,
 to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but
 maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really
 introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,
 you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.

     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]

     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a

     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's

     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad
     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was
     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody
     was like, ""The new guy"" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And
     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL
     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I
     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had
     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that
     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was
     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class
     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling
     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts
     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. ""Huh?
     Okay."" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. ""Okay. I heard about him.""

     something and then the girl told me, ""Hey he's calling you. The teacher is
     calling you."" She said that in Spanish. ""Mm-hmm. What you want me to do?

     Beto:
 
 
     ""Just go try to do it."" She actually translated for the teacher, so I just
     went in without talking. I just finished the equation. It was an equation.

     How'd you get that result?"" When he looked at me with those surprised eyes
     I was like, ""Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call
     my parents."" Then the girl says, the translator said, ""How do you do it?""
     ""Because that's how I learned to do it."" ""Where do you learn to do it? He's
     asking where you-"" ""Mexico."" ""He wants you to teach him how you did that.""

     come you just put the answer?""

     you just do this subtraction. That's it. If you are going to do division,
     you just put the answer in and put the few steps down there. You don't do
     the minus thingy on the bottom and continue with the big line on the
     bottom. No, you just do the equation and that's it. My teacher was like,

   to the car to see what happened and to see if they could help anybody,
   there was two kids dead there. They were probably between fifteen to

   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't
   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get

   Luisa: Being undocumented in the States, I think it's like being a bird in
   a golden cage. That's what it is. You're not allowed to go anywhere. You're
   not allowed to move. You're not allowed to do many things, but you're in
   this pretty golden cage that looks nice and you have certain things, but
   you don’t know what it’s like out there. It's awful. It is. It's like being

   your life. Can you talk about that too?
 
 
   Luisa: Being undocumented is being in the shadows. You feel this entire
   barrier between you and your friends and your teachers and the people that
   you're around and surrounding yourself with. You can never get too close to
   someone because you have this big thing lying in front of you. You can't
   let them know, so they don't really know you. It's a big part of it. You
   can't share the fear with anyone. You can't share this anxiety that you
   live with every single day. My mom was driving around and every time she'd
   drive, it was anxiety. I'd feel anxiety because what if she got pulled
   over? My mom—she’s an amazing driver—but what if she got pulled over? What
   if we got caught? That's it for everyone. We're done. That kind of thing
   affects you and you're not allowed to tell anyone. You have to live in the
   shadows. Nobody really knows.

   Luisa: Well, I think [Pause] our entire lives pretty much we were just … I
   was not allowed to tell anyone. I knew I was undocumented probably my
   entire life, but I think it never really hit home until certain things
   started happening. For example, my best friend, a Yugoslavian, her family
   is extremely very, very white [Chuckles]. Her grandparents are Yugoslavian.
   Fun fact, her grandfather was in the Second World War. I got a lot of good
   stories from him. [Laughs]

   was invited to. I was at her cousin's wedding. That's how involved we were.
   We were best friends.

   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed
   to tell this? This is a secret and—
 
 
   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.
   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty
   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I
   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science
   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not
   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you
   if you're an American citizen or not.
 
 
   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, ""I am
   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American."" She was put
   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in
   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm

   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that
   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…
 
 
   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave
   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,
   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone
   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who
   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad
   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,
   ""Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I
   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The
   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on
   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.
 
 
   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with
   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this
   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.
 
 
   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?
 
 
   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my
   dad after three, four years?
 
 
   Anita: You asked him to take you back?
 
 
   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't
   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, ""No,
   that's not happening with us.""
 
 
   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?
 
 
   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking
   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my
   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're
   human beings.
 
 
   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or
   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me
   leave the room. She was like, ""I can't see you right now. Leave the room.
   You're so much like your dad. Leave."" It really affected her. I get it.

   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.

   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the

   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took

   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, ""Oh, my God. What's

 asked me, I would have said American, definitely. I think six years of

 weird because you don't really... I feel like you don't really know how

 So for me, English is number one. I think I really enjoy the culture that
 they have work-wise. Work-wise, or at least, despite the fact never having
 worked there in school and such, it's a lot of no bullshit, you're here to
 do what you're here to do. And one of the things that for me has been
 really hard to adapt to here is that the culture in that sense is very
 different. Despite the fact that Mexicans are such hard workers and they
 are, sometimes they're also very lazy. And so I appreciate having grown up
 in a culture where you don't really beat around the bush. It's direct, it's
 to the point and it's not about just...

 last week with a friend, is I'm the type of person that in a restaurant, if
 I don't get a proper service or something, I speak up. And not necessarily,
 not talking about rudely, just I speak up when it's normally not done here.
 People tend to accept or just sit back and let things slide by. And I don't
 think that that's something that happens a lot in the States, or didn't,
 not speaking about the current government, but when I grew up there, it was
 just flu—I remember that things were fluid. And I don't know if that's also
 because as a kid, you don't notice or know of all the issues that are going
 on around, but yeah, I would say to summarize: English, definitely; the
 working mentality of no beating around the bush and directness; and kind of
 going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get
 your point across without hurting others.

   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,
   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't
   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.

   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other
   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out
   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had
   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like
   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else
   to help me out.

   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can
   have this at home.

   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view

   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the
   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in
   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for
   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing

   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,
   maybe look into those parents and help them.

   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in
   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been
   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years
   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my

   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not
   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.
   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who
   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who
   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But
   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking

   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This

   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?
   Yes, a plea.

   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going
   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.
   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did
   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A
   misdemeanor.
 
 
   Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean
   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,
   ""Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the
   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from
   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,
   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but

   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't
   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the
   US.

   expunge from your record?

   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you
   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you
   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it

   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, ""I don't

   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here
   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just
   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and
   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were
   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,

   case? You want to do something?” I said, “No.” And I told her I just want
   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the
   left, he was like, “No, like he has charges.” They wanted to deport me,
   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me ‘cause I'm not going
   back. But he said, like “He's got this, charges,” whatever. I don't know
   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with
   anything ‘cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained
   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him
   and the guy said, “Okay, we're deferring the charges.” That's just what he
   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].

   to do about it?"" And the director would try to find a solution or what so

   I can't do anything about it. I can’t be just behind your kid all day."" So

   Jeimmy: Yes. I think it took me like about two years to integrate into

   and there's Chilango. So, Chilango is way different than Spanish. They're

   [carnal means] brother.” What other words did they use? They would use
   expressions like, “ay ese hombre es un Don Juan,” [that man is a Don Juan]
   and I'm like, ""Who's Don Juan?"" And they're like, ""Oh no. It just means
