   ""Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”

   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon

   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're

   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting
   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because
   reading transports you to different places and different languages and
   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been
   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, ""You
   know what? I'm going to be independent,"" so she moves aside. She starts her
   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.

   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to

   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the
   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their
   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.
 
 
   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,
   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the
   attire?
 
 
   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would
   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took
   over.
 
 
   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he
   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, ""Oh, my God. What's
   happening?"" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually
   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,

 they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he
 had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have
 my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be
 able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's
 the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to
 learn, was that little recording machine.

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.
 
 
     Beto:
 
 
     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]
     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started
     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a
     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a
     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's

 what I wanted to, I want to travel the world, I want to learn every single
 style of cooking. I got Italian down, I got American style down, and I had
 a little bit of the London, English, all that. And I just want to keep
 learning, and I want to expand my portfolio, I want to learn as much as

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for
 detention for two months?

 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""

 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.
      
      
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.
      
      
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.

 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""
      
      
",cycle,Angelo,1,6
5121,text,32214,32786,"Isabel: Just in the moment when your baby fell off the bed, was she pushed
 back onto the bed and then that—
      
      
 Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave
 the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally
 got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.
      
      
 Isabel: That is just such a tragic…Like it's the worst way that could have
 gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing
 that, and that was the most difficult thing to -
      
      
","Time in the US, Feelings, Tragedy",Angelo,2,1
5122,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.

 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",Lack of mental health resources,Angelo,3,3
5124,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally

 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't

 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.

 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road

 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not

 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the

 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of

 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.

 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?

 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 was very hard. I feel like an outsider so I wouldn't really go up to
 people, I wouldn't go up to any other races. So it was very hard, I would
 really stay to myself and to that just one friend. Even sports, I couldn't
 do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted
 it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that
 belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my
 academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always
 told ""No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that
 you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way
 there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a

 ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,
 we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home
 and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,
 didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't
 seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just
 that mindset that, ""Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and

   related to deportees and I was wondering, you like many young men you came
   over with kids and growing up in the States for whatever reason end up
   getting in trouble. Why do you think that is, that it's such a prevalent
   pattern?
 
 
   Mike: I feel like it has a lot to do with you realizing that it's not like
   people say, because in America you're taught to believe if you really want
   something you could achieve it. And when you realize that that doesn't
   apply to you, that's what I feel like that's the big spiral down that you
   go to.
 
 
   Mike: Once you realize that it's not really how you were taught to believe,
   or not for you in that case, I feel like a lot of kids just give up and
   lose hope, because it's already hard as it is. Not being able to get a job
   and still trying to do things right without breaking the law. And then when
   you realize it's never going to change for you, man, you just like,
   ""Whatever. Okay."" Or, ""If I can't get it like this, I'm going to get it
   like that.""
 
 
   Mike: And a lot of thing is survival too. A lot of people have to survive.
   A lot of people don't have the luxury of being able to get up, go to work
   every day. A lot of people wish that they had a job. Would kill to just get
   up early and just get that paycheck. I know a lot of families that they
   have to go through the most, but they still do it, because they have to.
   They have no choice. And it's way better than here. And I didn't understand
   that until now.

   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next
   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.
   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I
   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out
   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going
   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.
 
 
   Mike: So they were like, ""Dude, you got to do something. You either going
   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to
   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do
   a voluntary departure and you go."" At that time I felt like I wasn't any
   good to anybody. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family."" So I just
   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran
   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was
   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I
   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just
   said, ""Screw it.""

   like “Me, me, me.” When I started getting older, I realized like, ""Dude,
   she only did it to give us a better life.""
 
 
   Anne: So you are saying the decision to come to the US was what...
 
 
   Mike: Not even that, it's just getting with my stepdad. I'd always had
   trouble listening to male authority, just because I didn't have that at
   all. So every time he would tell me to do something, I'd get so mad. I just
   want to punch him in the face. And it sucked, man, because he would always
   try to tell me stuff—he would do it for my own good.
 
 
   Mike: He would never get out of hand talk to me, but I would always explode
   on him. I would treat him like the parent that I never had who wanted to be
   back in my life. So you know you could kind of treat him like however you
   want? That's how I would treat him. And I just started realizing over time
   my dad just—this guy really cares about us. He's providing for five kids
   and still doesn't ask for anything.
 
 
   Mike: It just started growing on me and we started getting along and it
   started getting better. But yeah, I would not get along with my mom, or my
   dad at all. And my mom was—I feel like a lot of Mexican women and men, they
   have something against black folks even if you want to or not. I feel like
   that's racist too, because my mom would always be like, ""Why do you hang
   out with them? Why do you do this? Why do you do that?""
 
 
   Mike: I'm like, ""Because they're cool, man. They're like... I feel like
   these are my people. They've gone through the same struggles, a lot of the
   same stuff that happened to them. They would happen to me."" So I would
   always bring them over, and I remember one time my mom got so mad she
   grabbed an orange and threw it at my friend, but my friend was so tall, he
   just caught it.

   never stayed in my record, but I was getting in trouble constantly. And I
   liked it, because my parents would have to suffer. That's the sucky thing
   about it. Looking back at it now, I put my mom through a lot of stuff, and
   it sucks.
 
 
   Anne: So what kind of crimes did you commit?
 
 
   Mike: Basically it was just petty things. They would always catch us for
   skipping school. One time I remember my friend went into a gas station and
   stole some cigarettes, which is—how do you grab the cigarettes in the back
   counter? And I was with that guy. Fights. I also loved fighting. It's just
   a way of me just getting my anger out.
 
 
   Mike: I got a lot of disorderly conducts and it was for fighting. It's just
   something about fighting that just releases the stress. It just releases my
   anger. And since I didn't want to take it on my family, I would just
   always, whoever wanted it, I'd be the first one to step in. And it's crazy
   because I was the shortest one I remember. I was the shortest one man.

   want us.” Little did I know all that. She told me all this stuff that
   happened and I just started busting down and crying. And I was always mean
   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she
   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom—got my mom butt naked and
   put her in the closet—and left her there and then took us to Texas… I used
   to be mean to my little sister, but after I heard that, I was just like—me
   and her just got close and stuff. Yeah.

   in my pocket, and I had a dollar. A freaking dollar. I was like, ""God I

   moved back to Arizona, because we thought my dad wasn't there anymore.

   three months. And at that time my dad found us—because one of my family

   people. I mean, a lot of people do bad things, yeah. But it's not because
   we're immigrant. Everybody chooses what to do. They choose their own path.
   A lot of immigrant families, like I mentioned, go for a better future for
   their children and for themselves. A lot of them leave their home countries
   not because they want to, but because they have to because of violence,
   because of war, because of a lot of things. A lot of people in the US think
   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they
   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think
   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting
   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to
   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed
   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He
   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside
   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out
   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, ""Get
   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck"" at gunpoint. And he
   was like, ""Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my
   kids are in the car."" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in
   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I
   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he
   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.

   know if you're going to go back home. You don't know if you're even going
   to make it back home. In the news, constantly, there are women being found
   dead, beaten, shot. Even when you go into the public transportation,
   constant fear of having someone get in and shoot a gun. It's constant where
   I live. Public transportation is probably the worst thing you could go on
   because it's constant. The people getting on there to rob other people—they
   just shoot without even thinking twice. They shoot you and they don't care.

 me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued
 asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it
 has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and
 nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's
 pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the
 bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I
 remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I
 didn't like it. So I was like, ""I'm not doing this."" And without any
 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always
 tell you, ""we are hiring people,"" but it's only people with experience. So
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the
 supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't
 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a
 big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who
 found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take

 has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and
 nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's
 pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the

 remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I
 didn't like it. So I was like, ""I'm not doing this."" And without any
 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always
 tell you, ""we are hiring people,"" but it's only people with experience. So
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the
 supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't
 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a
 big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who

 compare it to, well, maybe not compare it. It's just, I feel that the fact
 that I didn't want to be here at first really affected the adapting into

 wonderful. It's just, there is a lot of beauty, there's a lot of kindness,
 if you know where to look, or even if not, but just, there is a lot of
 good, but it took me a really long time to see it. It took me years to

 to my sickness. I started hemorrhaging. I started to bleed out and it got
 to a point where it got really, really bad. I was hospitalized about four
 times. And yeah, it just got really, really bad to a point where I just
 didn't want to be hospitalized anymore. And so I told my parents that I
 refused to get hospitalized and my parents said, ""Well, we bought you a
 ticket to Mexico, so.""

 out of the hospital and I wasn't getting any better and I wasn't getting
 any treatment, except blood transfusions and such, my mom sent my medical
 records to my uncle. Don't really know what the discussion was there, I
 just knew that she sent him my papers. And from what I know, my uncle told
 my mom, ""You're either going to let her die there or you're going to send
 her so that I can help her."" So my parents were like, ""Okay."" And they just

 a little bit of human in everyone, but it's definitely not the same when
 you have papers. In terms of care, it's kind of... I don't know how to
 explain it but just, when you're in the hospital, people will make sure
 that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the
 word. But other than that, it was hell trying to get attention. It was my
 mom trying to ask, “What's wrong with her? What can they do?” Doctors just
 going, ""She just needs birth control. Put her on birth control and that's
 it."" Me going on birth control and nothing, not helping. And my mom just
 kind of desperate I would say, trying to get answers, falling again in the

 can't sue the doctor for malpractice because you're not even supposed to be

   Maybe not, because I grew up as a Chicano. Maybe not that much. I do
   remember other people being discriminated because they were from Mexico but
   from provinces, so they got even more. They got called paisanos. They were
   darker skinned, so I did feel it, not me personally, but I did feel it for

   Yes. That's, I guess, because of the area where we lived. I don't know. I
   guess my parents always wanted us to live in the nicer area so I would hang
   out with people like that. Then, when I would go see my friends, they
   didn't have white neighbors they had Mexican neighbors or people from other
   countries. In the area where I lived, we were the only Mexicans in the
   area. I do remember my neighbors that were black, the person on the side,
   he was my middle school coach from PE classes. We grew up in a very nice
   area. We had a front yard, a back yard, we had a pool in the back, we had a

   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such
   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of
   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say
   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a
   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four
   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my
   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a
   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.
 
 
   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the

   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that

   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,
   ""Okay."" So, I was like, ""It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I
   could just live with just one. That will be okay."" I was trying to not pay
   that much attention to that.

   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple

   ""Yeah, this is okay."" I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing
   for the phone. I was like, ""Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this
   one."" Then I got robbed. They took that phone—
 
 
   Isabel: In the same day?
 
 
   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw
   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even
   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, ""Yeah,
   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?"" And they didn't
   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was
   trying to scam him. They were like, ""Yeah? He took your phone? And why do
   you have one right there?"" And I was like, ""I can prove that they're both
   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,
   whatever you ask me."" They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?

   anything about it."" I was like, ""Okay. I think I'm going to leave right
   now."" I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was
   on that phone. I was like, ""I don't know how am I going to get to my
   house,"" and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, ""Okay,
   can you guys take me there?"" I said that to the police officers. They were

   officers, I was like, ""Yes! I'm going to get my things again!"" I didn't
   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,
   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if
   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press
   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that

 You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like … I was always
 told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many
 of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get
 into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.
 But I was always like, “No, because if something happens to me or the
 police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would
 involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.” Here I think I would still do
 the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, “You
 can't go out.” I'd be like, “Okay.” I'm still very obedient. All right, I
 don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with

 years. At my last job I had to work, I had a day of like ten and a half
 hours and then I had two-hour commute. So that ate up most of my time, and
 I was just coming home to sleep basically. But I loved my job very much. I
 was like, “Oh, I don't need school right now. I'll figure it out
 eventually.” And five years went by and right now I'm like, “This is kind
 of the perfect job for school because it's so relaxed.” I am off on
 Fridays, I'm off Saturdays. I work from home a lot of days. But it's a lot
 of stuff that I have to ask my parents to do over there to go get my
 documents and stuff apostilled—I think it's called—or certified and then I
 have to translate them.
      
      
 Anne: All your education documents or transcripts and all that stuff.
      
      
 Brenda: Yes. So, I can eventually go to school here. Then there's this fear
 of like, ""Oh my God, what if I don't get into any of the public schools?""
 Because I'm like, ""No, I want to go to one of the public universities"" and
 if I don't, that's another cost and now it's like I don't want to leave
 work because I like working and I'd have to do it on the weekends. Then in
 my head, I'm already like, ""Oh my God, am I already not struggling through
 to balance a schedule I don't even have yet."" I'm just already stressed
 about it [Laughs]. But I do, basically, it's to go back to school because I

 Brenda: We waited a long time. It was about a year and a half because
 everybody was like, “It's going to be about three or six months, three or
 six months.” And that passed, we were finally stuck there and it was
 because of the Hague Convention—if I'm not mistaken—which is like an
 international adoption thing that a lot of countries sign into to try to
 avoid human trafficking for children. Everything that we did with my aunt,
 which was technically live with her for two years, begin the adoption
 process before I was fifteen. All of these things that we did, we were
 supposed to have done them here in Mexico. And we tried to dispute it
 because we were like, ""We've never lived in Mexico and my aunt's not from
 Mexico. Why would we go to Mexico to do this?"" So they're like, ""No, but
 you can keep appealing it. But that's the process, you were supposed to do
 all of that in Mexico."" The point is that we didn't want to, there was no
 reason for us to go to Mexico. We've never been there, my brother left when
 he was one and I was three. So, we were always in the US and so it didn't
 get declined completely, it just got, I guess, on hold and it's been like
 that for the last—when did this happen—like five, six years? So on my end,
 I'm good being here. I like being here, but it's because of my brother and
 his autism and he's very much in his own world of his habits and what his
 plans are and everything. It was really hard for him to come.
      
      
 Brenda: It was a complete disruption to his routine. It was a complete—like
 being away from his parents, being with people he didn't really know that
 well. Being in a different country, like language he doesn't speak as
 well—everything was hard. So, I don't touch that process because I know
 it's technically still going on and the hope is that one day he can go
 back. Me, I'd be happy to just go visit once, maybe often. But for him,
