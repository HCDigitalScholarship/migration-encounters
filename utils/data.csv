 assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in

 things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take
 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't
 have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they
 have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out

 would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For
 instance, I took business management, small business management, was one of
 the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--
 definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance
 because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real
 estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor
 in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,
 but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in
 Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the
 opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that
 much capital to be able to take that much more on.

 the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines
 of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and
 free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all

 the horse stables of course I grew up around it because the owners of the
 stables, they would talk to us in English and they would give us candies,
 they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he
 had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have
 my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be
 able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's
 the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to
 learn, was that little recording machine.

 American kid?

 high school, the high school I went to, there was very few Hispanics-

 one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like
 working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And
 then finally, poof and from there everything changed.

 stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to
 go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED
 program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I
 just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college
 courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on
 them!

 mother would give me these little comic magazines, Mexican comic magazines,
 and she'd have me read them. And then she would make me write letters to my
 grandmother. So that's how I was able to learn a little bit of, keep the
 Spanish and English.","Time in the US, Mexican traditions,  Spanish language",Ben

 parents decide to take you?
      
      
 Ben: Well, they decided to take me because of hardships here. My father
 had already left to the United States. He was already working over there
 when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left
 to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my
 mother, my brother and I, and took us with him, back to Dallas, around the
 outskirts of Dallas.
      
      
 Ben: He was good with horses, so he was working at a horse stable, a
 very prominent horse stable, that caters to most of the people around SMU,
 or Southern Methodist University, that keep all their horses there. So,
 mainly it was to give us a better life, because things are bad around that
 little town. There's no opportunities.

 I didn't know much about it but what my parents told me once I got older
 was where we lived, it was a small ranch type area, and there was a lot of
 narc activity going there and it got to the point where one of my uncles
 got injured in some type of crossfire, and so they wanted to avoid that for
 us and they also wanted a better life for themselves and see for their
 whole planning the family type part, so they decided they wanted to come to
 the States. And they came, they crossed over when I was really young. My
 mom told me that she carried me in her arms whenever she crossed me over,
 and so it was... I don't have any idea about it, but that's what she told
 me. I kind of have an imagination of what kind of went down.

 get kind of annoying at some point. Everybody at all times, for every
 single thing. It's just like, everybody, at all times, for every single
 thing, and like people here go to school and they have English homework, I
 don't mind doing that, but then when we go somewhere and they're hanging
 out and every other thing, they're like, ""Hey, what is that? Or how you say
 this or how do you do that or how do you say that or what does that mean or
 what does this..."" It's like all right, I can't really do what I want to do
 because I got to go over here and translate everything else or tell you how
 to say all this other stuff just because. I don't mind, but it's like to a

 confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to
 have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in
 the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be
 safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,
 go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see
 me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that
 stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All
 right.
      
      
 Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but
 at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to
 help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be
 able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm
 not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's
 why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that
 they could say, ""Hey, your dad's never there."" He's like, ""No, but he's
 always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him
 emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me
 that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in
 my life important.""
      
      
 Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my
 wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't
 have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from
 here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We
 weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just
 felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were
 going to grow up and be like, ""Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did
 everything. He's the one that get the money."" She's like, ""I want to feel
 like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own
 heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.""

 anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own
 stuff."" She's like, ""No, but I just still feel like it's difficult."" So
 right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix
 things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,
 and I understand my mom too at the same time like, ""Hey, you don't want to
 go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do
 you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.""

 here, moved in a place around here. That's where my family is at. I don't
 have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over
 there, since I had first got there, I was struggling. I didn't have a
 phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,
 anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a
 year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the
 minutes and stuff, since it was a little place, you had to go buy a card
 with minutes to call. Once the card was over, you had to buy another card
 or they had to pay and it wasn't good.
      
      
 Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little
 young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's
 always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm
 not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom
 provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and
 be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing
 something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they
 need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than
 myself. Like I said, shoe brands, all that stuff don't matter to me. I want
 to have my family, I want to be happy and make my kids happy. See my family
 grow and see my kids grow. See what they become, because I expect them...

 anger issues, and when I was in school, one of my teachers always... you

 some reason, he always wanted to pick on me, even though I wasn't raising
 my hand. And I was having some bad times with the whole issues with my

 was having some issues so I was kind of having issues moving around at the

   and basically left to reunite with my dad, who had left first. He saw an
   opportunity and thought that it would be better for us. So, we packed our
   things and then my mom, brother, and I, we went over to meet my dad.

   government do to help Mexican deportees and the family that they leave
   behind? What do you think?
 
 
   Ilse: Well, for one thing, a lot of people that are deported don't even
   have a criminal record. They don't have no background or anything that
   says, ""Oh, you're a bad person, and you can't be here."" Maybe just really
   giving them a chance to—especially when you deport the dad, or the mom, and
   they leave their family behind. Like, why would you separate families? I
   mean, that's not even humanly fair. It's so unfair. It's so, so unfair.
 
 
   Ilse: I understand their ground, I understand that “Why would they be
   invaded by Mexicans?” But they also have to understand the situations here.
   Maybe work along, like I said, fix a problem from the root. I don't know.
   Both governments have to sit down and talk about this. Like right now, the
   importing tariff that was imposed of five percent on all the Mexican
   products being exported to the U.S. unless we stop the people crossing
   over. But if we had more opportunities and the governments both worked
   together to make the economy grow here and have more chances for them not
   to even think about leaving, it would change a lot. So, we have to analyze
   why people are leaving, and try to fix that problem. And they should work
   together. It sounds so easy, right? But it's so complicated. [Laughs]

   ""Oh, well, I came back because I wanted to."" And then, them looking at me
   weird, like, ""Why would you come back if you were over there?"" Or when they
   ask, ""Did you have to come back because you were illegal?"" Dude, well,
   yeah, I came back because I couldn't stay over there, but you don't have to
   treat me differently.

   back and forth, and they don't understand; ""Well, why don't you get a visa?
   Why did you leave without a visa?"" “No...” And I think changing that
   mindset, too, from the people that are here— the people that were born here
   and everything—there must be a way to make them understand that we're still
   Mexican. It wasn't our decision most of the time, why we had to leave. You
   know?

   deport people, you know? I think a few years back, they had flights to
   Mexico City, but they canceled that with the Trump administration. So now,
   they pretty much dump them on the border, and they have to see how they can
   find help. So, I think one of the things we have to strengthen is our part
   of the border. Help people in the border.
 
 
   Ilse: When I left, I remember how the Mexican government, the Mexican
   officials, they gave us a talk. Like, ""Oh, you're about to do something
   that's not right, but if it's your decision, we can't force you or stop you
   from doing it."" Why not change that speech? Why not say, ""Don't leave. How
   can we help you so you won't leave?"" I mean, we could fix a problem from
   the root, why they're leaving. And then, when they do come back, analyze
   the people, make a profile—there's a lot of people that are being deported
   that have so much knowledge.

   that, when it was raining, too... This was like a breaking point. There was
   a little, small creek, or little river, I guess you could say. When there's
   a thunderstorm and it's so dark, the thunder and then you're blacked out,
   you're blinded because of the light. And then, we lost track of the people.
   So, my mom and I got lost, right?
 
 
   Ilse: So, we had to cross the little creek thing, and then my mom just
   slipped, and she was about to just keep going with the flow, and I was
   so... God is amazing, because I just can't believe He gave me the strength,
   you know, to save my mom. And this man came back for us. It's just so
   crazy, because who does that, you know? Who actually comes back to check on
   people when you have to take care of yourself? He helped us, we crossed it,
   but we were still lost. So, once again, we got to a point where, like,
   ""Okay, we're going to wait it out.""
 
 
   Ilse: But it rained so hard, and it was so hot, and we didn't have anything
   to eat or no water, and then I was just like blacked out. My mom says that
   I was gone for hours, and I was hallucinating, and literally, she thought I
   was going to die because it was so bad. So, the men that were with us, they
   went out looking for water or something, and they came across this—they
   said it was kind of like a pond kind of thing, but it was more like animal
   pee and, I don't know. So, they brought that back. My mom still had some
   limes, and my mom put lime in it, and she kept trying to get me water, and
   that's how like, I came back apparently. That's what she said. I don't
   remember anything about that.
 
 
   Ilse: So, the coyote comes back, and he's like, ""Okay, I found out a way.
   We're good to go. We just got to keep walking."" And that was the third day.
   And so, we kept walking, and I don't know where we hear the helicopter, and
   we hear the vans, and dogs, and they caught us, you know? We were so close.
   So close. And yet so far, literally.

   siblings, with a coyote or did you just go by yourselves?
 
 
   Ilse: My dad had a friend in the States, and he had family in Guerrero. So,
   they're like, ""So you guys won’t come alone, meet up with that family, so
   you can all come over."" And so, we met this family. It was a mom with a
   son—he's older than me for about two years, I think, and a girl. She was,
   at that time, she was like five, I think. She was so small.
 
 
   Ilse: My brother, he was seven at the time; so he's younger than me. And
   so, we met up in the city and we traveled to the border. The plan was to
   cross the border through the desert, all of us, with a coyote. But my
   brother and the little girl were too young. I was too young, too, but I
   didn't want to leave my mom. So, they separated us.
 
 
   Ilse: My brother went with this other family, who took care of him, and he
   crossed the border asleep in a car, which was... it was, I want to say
   easy, but after hearing his story, and how he had to suffer because these
   people hit him, and you know, abused him, because he couldn't do anything.
   People were just mean to him, and he was trying to protect the little girl,
   that then I understood that it wasn't easy for him, either.

   look at you like if you were some kind of alien, because they've never seen
   many Latins, you know? Because we arrived to a really small community in
   North Carolina, and it was kind of, like, hillbillies, and they're pretty
   racist. [Laughs].
 
 
  ","Time in the US, North Carolina",Ilse
4104,text,1139,2469,"Claudia: Right. And do you remember your first day in the United States?
 
 
   Ilse: Definitely! [Laughs]. You see, I was very angry from the time my mom
   told me that we had to leave Mexico. I was happy in Mexico. I have a lot of
   friends. I mean, I was only nine, but when you're nine, especially I think
   prior to this generation, you're very aware; at least, my mom always made
   me like that. She'd educated me to always be independent, and to always
   work hard at everything that I did. Obviously, at that time, I only went to
   school, right? But I also sold candy outside of my house so I could help my
   mom out a little bit, and I did so well in school, you know? I was so
   happy. I actually got a scholarship being in Mexico so I could keep going
   to school. I had straight A's. You know?
 
 
   Ilse: And just out of nowhere, my mom coming up to me and saying, ""You're
   going to have to leave everything behind because we're going to go see your
   dad,"" that was just so shocking for me. And then, the whole journey to get
   to the US, which I'll never forget, and it's... I really pray that no
   nine-year-old ever has to go through that type of stuff. And then, getting
   to the US and not knowing anyone, and feeling totally out of place, and
   that first day was just so awful for me.

   stay with my mom and my brother, and yeah, it was hard because my mom

   supposed to be just a family visit, and it kind of extended a little bit
   longer than it was supposed to. Then I just went back. My mom called me.

   anyone should go through that. It's pain, it's painful. You don't know how
   many nights I've fallen asleep crying just thinking about everything that
   someone could say to you or things that they have said to me. You don't
   know how much your words can hurt a person. How much just a simple word
   could end their life. A lot of people have committed suicide because of
   that, because they couldn't bear with everything that's going on. A lot of
   people have lost their lives. I don't think it's fair. No one should have
   to be afraid of going outside or going to work. You're just going to work.
   You're not doing anything bad. You're not going against the law. I mean,
   you're working. You're trying. As a student, you try every day. Other kids
   do bully you if they find out that you're not a U.S. citizen. They'll call
   you names. They'll pick on you. Some have been kicked, punched, etc. That's
   not what a kid should go through, especially not if you're really young. A
   lot of five-year-olds go through that. Imagine a kid going through that. An
   innocent child that shouldn't be put through that.

   deporting people like Joana?
 
 
   Joana: Well, they lose mainly trust because you don't trust anyone. You're
   always afraid. We live in fear. You don't trust anyone. What they lose is
   workers. We pay taxes. They lose, maybe, ties to certain things in Mexico
   because they do have to export, import. If this keeps going on, at the end
   of the day, they're going to stop because Donald Trump doesn't apparently
   want us in the United States, so why does Mexico have to give them anything
   that's Mexican? I mean, Mexico is a country where they do have a lot of

   Joana: There's a lot... Being American, to me, it means you can do, you can
   be free. You can live your life like you want to. That doesn't mean you're
   going to break the laws. That doesn't mean you're going to commit an
   offense, but it means that you can actually live freely and without the
   worry that you're going to get deported anytime. I don't think that's
   living because you're always afraid. You're always afraid of anyone and
   everyone. You never know when that person's going to stab you in the back
   and call I.C.E. on you. That's what everyone's afraid of. Everyone doesn't
   want to say that they're undocumented. No one wants to admit it because

   American?
 
 
   Joana: I guess in every way. There's a lot more connection to me with an
   American citizen than there is with a Mexican citizen. The cultures,
   they're so different. I mean, pizza isn't really even pizza here to be
   honest. A hamburger isn't a hamburger. It's an American dish. In Mexico
   they have other foods. They have other cultures. They have a variety of
   things. Being American, to me, it feels like I can go travel. I don't even
   know how to explain it. I just don't know how to put it. I guess, it means
   to me, it feels like... I really, I don't have the words right now. I guess

   people, hard-working people. They are falling between the cracks because
   these people, they're not paying attention to what is happening here.
 
 
   Juan: We know of many people, they're very talented and they can't get
   opportunities because they don't have an ID. For Christ's sake, they don't
   have an identification to get a job. I just know of a friend of mine, she
   was interviewed twice, and getting very good bilingual jobs. And she
   couldn't take them because she didn't have the identification to take the
   job. And that, it hurts. It hurts very much to see people struggle like
   that. Being discriminated and kicked out of a country that don't really
   like them. And then you're just hoping to make it work here in their own
   country, when all this government and these politicians and these people in

   terrible and it hurts because it's just a matter of, if they were doing
   their jobs, I can almost guarantee you that almost no Mexican people would
   want to go to the United States and work and find a better life. And they
   do, I did, because I had no opportunities, I had no opportunities here. If

   way. All of these immigration things, it's all about politics, it's all
   about control, controlling the American people and controlling the Mexican
   people. If they wanted to, they could have many agreements, so we didn't
   have to go illegally. And they could have had many, many agreements to
   allow people to go to work and come back. Because people don't want to go
   and stay. People do not want to go and stay there and live there. They want
   a better life. And they want to make money and many times just come back

   the United States gave me more opportunities than my own country gave me.

   identification that a Mexican citizen can have to do anything—to open a
   bank account, to rent a house, to get a passport, to get a driver’s
   license. That identification we cannot get because they are in elections
   and we are not allowed to get in until the election is over, which is in
   July. Ever since March, I haven't been able to get an identification where
   I can reestablish my life precisely because I cannot open a bank account, I
   cannot get a job. When you get a job here, they want you to get that
   identification. They want you to show that identification just to show that
   it's you. During this time, all the deportees and people returning to
   Mexico are going through a very difficult time. Just because these people,
   all they care is about that stupid election. All they care is about getting
   their jobs and getting elected and all, while we ...

   just giving us the long run. They are just giving us, ""Oh no, they didn't
   authorize the payment, you need to come back the next month."" And next
   month… It's been three months already, I have not been able to get anything
   from them. And I haven't been able to get a job because I don't have an
   identification. That is so stupid and ridiculous because how are we
   supposed to live? How are we supposed to pay our rent or to even get money
   for transportation to go and look for another job?
 
 
   Juan: I can go look for a job, but it doesn't matter, it doesn't do any
   good because I cannot identify myself. I don't have an identification to
   identify myself. And the same problems that I have is the same problem that
   I see in many, many people returning to Mexico from the United States.
   These people, they are in very, very bad shape. Very bad shape because they
   cannot get a job, they cannot open up an account, they cannot register
   their kids in school. They cannot do anything because the authorities, they
   don't care. They don't care about us, they don't care about nobody but
   themselves. Another thing that I hate, I hate, I hate, it's like the time
   stopped and it never moved. When I came back, it was the same corruption,
   the same corrupted politicians, the same people that, instead of helping
   the citizens, they're helping themselves, putting money in their pockets.
   And all that money that is supposed to go to our programs to help
   immigrants and people like us? They're going to their pockets.

   was the same, the authorities, they are very rude, they are corrupt, they
   want money for anything. They actually stole a document from my wife. My
   wife, she's an American citizen, and they asked her for her passport. And
   for them to give her the document as she was crossing to Mexico, they
   charged her $60 for that document. When later I find out that it has to be
   free. If you register, if you tell them that you're there and all that,
   that document's supposed to be free. These policemen, they charged her $60.
   Then, when I was getting my bags checked at the customs, they wanted me to
   pay money to let me take my bags. And I just, I started fighting, arguing
   with them. Not necessarily fighting, but I was arguing with them that, why
   I had to pay them for something that was mine, it was my clothes, my shoes,
   all my things. They wanted me to give money to allow me to take my things.

   basically was because when the president that is at the White House right
   now, he changed the rules and everything. He made a task of making people
   leave or getting deported and all that. And he started tightening all the
   rules and the laws. And I'm living in the state of Texas, and Texas
   participated a lot with that policy. And the police department was
   cooperating with them, meaning that if you had a traffic ticket you could
   get arrested and taken to immigration, to process your deportation.

   was leaving my wife and my children behind. My home, my cars, and

   happening, than being arrested and maybe put in jail because I heard that
   they're putting people in jail and they keep you there for a long time. And

   I got two escapes. As an adult, I got one. So, I'm automatically an escapee
   under their eyes.
 
 
   Weco: So, he's like, ""Turn yourself in. It looks better for you. It will
   make it look like you're trying to get things right, trying to do right.""
   So I was like, ""All right. Just give me a minute. Let me get some money. I
   got to leave some money at home, got to leave some money for me too."" He's
   like, ""All right.""
 
 
   Weco: So, after that, I turned myself in. I did four months with the state.
   They dropped some of the charges, then I did some time. Then after that,
   immigration came and picked me up again for violating my first bond. Then
   that's when I actually did two years trying to fight my case.

   actually did eight months with federal. I did federal time first. Then the
   judge actually gave me time served since it was my first time. I was the
   first offender that was 19 years old in there. Even my lawyer that was
   there, she was like, ""You're my first young offender here in federal
   court.""

   to get away. Somebody is going to lose this one."" So, during that process,
   I actually was able to take my handcuffs off.
 
 
   Isabel: How'd you do that? Just removed them?
 
 
   Weco: Yeah, I pulled them out. I pulled them out. He didn't put them on
   that tight. So, I pulled them out, I got loose. After that, we had a
   minivan. I still remember today. It's a minivan, the middle seats are not
   even there. I'm in the back seat. As soon as we get to where I was knowing
   we was going to get to, I said, ""All right. We finna get off the freeway.
   It's a stop light. If that light turns red, I'm gone.""
 
 
   Isabel: How old were you?
 
 
   Weco: I was 19, going on 20.
 
 
   Isabel: Was it like an adrenaline? Were you nervous? What was it like in
   that moment?
 
 
   Weco: My mind was just like, ""Fuck it. It's my life or his life. It's going
   to be my life. He ain't going to..."" I looked at it like just, ""What? Just
   because he says and somebody higher than him says just because I'm illegal
   they're going to deport me? You're fucking with the wrong one. You're going
   to have to catch me."" That's the way I looked at it. “You're fucking with
   the wrong one.”
 
 
   Isabel: So, then the light turned red, and what happened?
 
 
   Weco: As soon as we got there, the light was actually turning yellow. I was
   like, ""Man, it's now or never."" So, I just went ahead and got up. First
   thing I did was punch the window. It cracked. After that, he turned around.
   He was on the phone. I still remember the whole action. He was on the
   phone, dropped the phone. He was trying to put the car in park. He was
   trying to take his belt off. He was also trying to grab his gun and grab
   the cell phone at the same time, but it was just too much. So I just went
   ahead. And as soon as I punched the window, it came in my mind. I was like,
   ""What am I doing?"" I'm like, ""Man, I just made this worse."" So, I was like,
   ""I might as well just complete with it.""
 
 
   Isabel: Right. Like the damage is done, you think?
 
 
   Weco: If I did it, I might as well just do it. Because either way, if I
   don't do it, they're going to hit me with attempt to escape. It's like, ""I
   might as well just go all the way out. I already did it."" So, I just
   punched the window again, and my whole body went through it. I just fell,
   hit the floor, got up, hit the freeway, jumped a couple fences, hid through
   a alley, and I was gone. I was gone.
 
 
   Isabel: So, what happened?
 
 
   Weco: They didn't find me.
 
 
   Isabel: What?
 
 
   Weco: They didn't find me. It took them four days to find me.

   Isabel: Was it just weed or other drugs as well?
 
 
   Weco: Let me remember at that time. No, at the time it was weed and coke.
   It was weed and coke and a handgun. I got arrested for that. I actually
   went to trial. I won my case, but you know after that, immigration, once
   they get ahold of you, you got to go with them.
 
 
   Weco: So, they gave me a court date with them. But during that, I had to be
   transferred from one jail to another jail, from a state jail to an
   immigration jail. During that process, I asked the officer, I was like,
   ""What's my situation look like?"" Well, he told me straight up, he was like,

   Weco: I was being bad. Really, I was being bad. I was with some friends, we

   how it is. We used to be young, crazy. When I was 13, I caught my first

   get into fights stuff like that.
 
 
   Anita: So tell me about this. We're trying to understand this, what is so
   exciting about gangs?
 
 
   Diana: I believe in my situation, you know I cannot speak for everybody,
   but in my situation it was most likely the losing of interest in school
   because when I was here in Mexico, I was one of the ones with the good
   grades and I had some other set of goals here. So then when I was over
   there, everything changed. I got sent back and then what they were teaching
   was like, for me it was way below grade. So then I started hanging out with
   bad people and then my mom was working all the time, so I had a lot of
   alone time.

   Here you know for sure that the people that make more money, they don't
   treat everybody the same. Also, in the jobs that happens a lot too. A lot
   of people have more preferences and there's a lot of that kind of things.
   Over there I never experienced that. Over there, in my experience, if all
   the time I did a good job, they let me know I was doing a good job, and
   they put me up in another position stuff like that, I could grow up in the
   – it wasn't that hard, but here is, since let's say if there is a position
   that you want, but then there's somebody else that wants it and he's
   friends with the manager or something, he's going to get it first, that
   kind of things.

   know how over there you, let's say when you're driving, when I started
   driving, you know how over there you have to respect the people that are
   walking and then you follow rules a lot more. Here nobody cares. If you’re
   walking, the cars just, they don't care about you, and here you also see
   that the traffic's worse always because let's say if the lights are not
   working, it's not like over there that you know that the person on the
   right goes first. You stop, and you know it's like that. Everybody knows
   that, so you do it. And then here is like no, everybody wants to go first.
   It causes chaos and then a lot of people, mostly that is very insecure. The
   first time we got robbed, we were taking my son to school, and they stopped
   us and they had guns and they took everything. They even took his backpack
   and it’s like, why do you need his backpack?

   because it was different because I see over there, there's people that are
   there for a lot of years and they don't learn to speak English. A lot of
   people that go over there from Mexico, they want everything to adapt to
   them. They want stuff to be in Spanish, and I mean it's okay, but I think
   that at some point, if you are living over there, you have to adapt, to the
   living over there. And also, it's better you start meeting more people, you
   have more opportunities, they treat you different.

   Diana: Yeah, maybe because I was 19, so it was fun, it was really fun.
 
 
   Anita: Was it hard to find all these jobs without papers?
 
 
   Diana: It was because let's say my mom's family and then they mostly work
   at restaurants and stuff like that. But I don't really like restaurants
   stuff. Working at a restaurant, I don't like it that much.
 
 
   Anita: Why?
 
 
   Diana: I don't know. I'm not that friendly with people. Then I found the
   movie theaters and then they – is because you know how you don't say that
   you don't have papers, so they probably thought since I was young I was
   just like a teenager and then they didn't really ask me are you papers real
   or anything. I had fake papers.
 
 
   Anita: And you had fake papers of all these different jobs?
 
 
   Diana: Yes.
 
 
   Anita: And nobody ever asked you anything?
 
 
   Diana: No. I'm pretty sure they assume because you know there's a way to
   know because the social security numbers that they give you, if you know
   about it, they're not actual. They might be from people that are from the
   50s or stuff like that. So there's a … but they don't really – I'm pretty
   sure a lot of them knew, but they don't really ask, they probably be like,

   worked all day too and stuff like that. And then here I tried to go back to
   school, but because they needed me to certificate the school that I was
   over there, and I couldn't because my mom didn't get prepared at all she
   just sent me back. They wanted me to go back again and start all from where

   cutting school a lot, so then you know how they contact the parents and
   stuff. So, she had to go out of her work to go and take me to school and
   stuff like that so – but what did make her just say “no, no, no, I don't
   want you-“ is because I started fighting a lot more. And then there was one
   time that we were – she had then, because of I caught school, she would go
   pick me up now. I had to be at school. Then one time she pick me up and
   then we got on the bus. I usually didn't get on the first bus because it

   when I got there, because I did not speak English, I got bullied a lot. So,
   starting you know hanging out with the people that were in gangs and stuff

   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next
   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.
   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I
   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out
   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going
   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.
 
 
   Mike: So they were like, ""Dude, you got to do something. You either going
   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to
   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do
   a voluntary departure and you go."" At that time I felt like I wasn't any
   good to anybody. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family."" So I just

   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was

   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just

   planting them, and I was like, ""Please, God..."" When I was praying, I was
   like, ""Please God, let me get this food so I can feed my brothers and

   just lied to us and said that my mom didn't want us.

   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she
   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom—got my mom butt naked and

","Mexican childhood, Memories",Jesus C
8737,text,39145,40554,"Jesus: Changing a government, the thing that has been established for over
 decades, is like changing religion. [Laughs]. It's one of the hardest
 things to do. In religion, all the religions teach the same thing. Love one
 another, peace. So why can't all of them be just one religion? But, no.
 It's just separation. It's just changing separation, having to unify people
 when everybody's already separated, they've been like that for decades,
 takes a lot of people. I think the solution to that would be just unifying
 the country, and making that one goal, one human goal. The one goal that
 every human could have, and everybody could have access to food and shelter
 and stuff, but based on wanting the people to grow, want their knowledge to
 grow, because more people put their minds on one thing. It's easier for it
 to be done, it's proven. You get five people to flip a car over, they'll do
 it. If one person tries, they're never going to do it. So just changing
 everybody's mindsets and having the opportunity for everybody to live
 correctly, I think that would make a better world. It would help everybody
 use their minds for other things than just work. They could use it for
 their creative sides where they could start creating things that could help
 better mankind as a whole. Like free energy. Water is infinite—not really,
 because we're killing it, you know? [Laughs].

 control it. It's only 1% that controls that system. So, trying to change
 the government is going to be the hardest thing to do. I'm guessing it's
 more like changing yourselves, changing the people, because the people are
 the majority of the people that live in the United States. So maybe just
 changing off from that racism and that stereotypes and all that, and going
 a different way, taking a different look at life where we're just humans.

 even know I was going over there, so everything was just interesting.
 [Chuckles] Then once I got there, life was difficult for me being an
 immigrant, especially because I did it illegally. If I had done it legally,
 I think it would've been much easier, and I would've probably done a lot
 better, had a lot of things to look forward to and stuff. But I guess, just
 open your mind. Just to be open to people, not judge a book by its cover.
 If you get to know them, you might know that they have other things that
 are better. Do you want to better yourself, better the world, better
 everybody? It's hard. It's hard when you don't have access to things. A lot
 of people need support. A lot of people have good ideas, good intentions.

 things because over there, it's more liberal in the States. They reserve
 some things, but if you ask them for help, they might be more willing to
 help you than here, because everybody here is super sketchy: ""I don't know
 if you're going to rob me, I don't know if you're going to do this.” If I
 go out and I ask somebody, ""Can I borrow five bucks just to get home?""
 They're not going to want to do it because they think I'm just going to go

 I'm bad or something. I don't know why. Last time I got kicked out of a

 They're mostly more south or more up north, because right here is where
 it's more controlled actually. That's what I'm learning. Right here in the

 there for about half a year, a year, before my mom, my brother and I went
 to join him. I was three when we went over there. So I was very little. I
 just remember he would call, and he would say like, “Are you going to be

 wasn't very sure if she wanted to move over there.

 people that … It's a good pay for all you have above anyone else is
 English. There's a lot more educated people than me without jobs here in
 Mexico—that’s the only thing they don't have, English—and I might get paid
 twice as much. And that's all the friends that I've made through the call
 centers through English, bilingual jobs. I’ve been very fortunate because
 it's people that I can talk to in Spanglish with each other and that
 understand me culturally, which is another thing.

 it?
      
      
 Brenda: I don't know. I think it's just tough because I don't think it can
 be—what is it they call it—like a blanket solution of “okay, let everyone
 go through” or “give everyone automatic resident status” or whatever. I
 remember there was a few things that I saw I think when John, I forgot his
 name, was really opposing Obama during his second re-election. But a lot of
 things that I saw were like, “Oh you have to go through schooling.”
      
      
 Anne: John McCain?
      
      
 Brenda: Not John McCain—maybe I'm thinking of George W. Bush the second
 time he went through. But I remember it was a lot of like, “Oh, the men
 going through a military training or going through school or making sure
 that you've gone all these years without any law-breaking and stuff.” I was
 like, “That's fair because most immigrants are trying to stay out of
 trouble.” I can attest to being scared of … “No, we have to be sure that
 we're good and making sure going to school or getting a job” and I think
 that's just normal basic things to ask for.
      
      
 Brenda: But I think those would have been great. It's harder now. I don't
 see the appeal right now in the US, sometimes it's a struggle because of
 how the political climate has been going since I left. I left when Obama
 had just gotten into the White House. So, it was really hard to see that
 transition completely the last few years. But I definitely think a system
 has to come up because I feel like it keeps getting pushed aside. We'll do
 it later, we'll do it later. Definitely for the people in the DACA program
 now that they've never known anything else.

 hadn't left before it was installed into place.","Reflections, The United States, Policy to help migrants, DACA",Brenda

 Brenda: I think here it's harder, I took a course a couple of years ago. It
 was like a Shakespeare course and it was all in English and I remember
 being like, “Oh, this is the luckiest thing I've ever found.” I took it and
 I liked it a lot. But I know when I would try to speak to some of the other
 guys in Spanish, it was hard. My Spanish has gotten better, but it's still
 hard to communicate certain things. So probably not theater. I like cooking
 a lot. So maybe something like gastronomy or I looked a lot into sociology,
 insight, and psychology. I like those for all being interesting.

 years made you a different person than you would have been if you had grown
 up here?
      
      
 Brenda: Probably. Sometimes I have very optimistic ideas about certain
 things. I think that—not as a judgment towards anyone—I'm a good kid over
 there. Sometimes a lot of it was because of fear of if you get in trouble.
 You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like … I was always
 told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many
 of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get
 into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.
 But I was always like, “No, because if something happens to me or the
 police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would
 involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.” Here I think I would still do
 the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, “You
 can't go out.” I'd be like, “Okay.” I'm still very obedient. All right, I
 don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with
 anyone.
      
      
 Brenda: I just do as I'm told. I think it would've been similar, but maybe
 have … I don't know, I probably would have started working a lot younger
 helping my family out and such. Over there because I couldn't work, it was
 mainly to stay in at home babysitting my siblings. I think those kinds of
 things, I wasn't as exposed to a lot of the world as I was—or am now, here.
 I think that would have been different with my exposure.

 could see if I like it here. Then worst case, I get my papers, I do school
 here and I go back over there—especially, economically it might've made
 more sense.” My mom was always like, “No, three more months, next month.”
 So, [Sigh] it went like that for a year and a half. When I came back, my
 brother, I would try to take him out as much as I could. He always chose
 American places like Chili’s or whatever places. I was like, ""That's fine,
 but it costs a lot more money."" So, money that my mom would send me that
 would last me months, in one outing with him, I would use it all because I
 wanted to make him happier, have him be calm. So, I was like, ""This isn't
 going to last."" So, I was like, ""I need to get a job."" That's when I

 didn't end up being able to get residency or anything, and I don't know why
 we went with him specifically. But he just kept saying, ""You have to

 this time, I keep seeing that a lot of people that do this immigration
 process, in particular, don't leave the US. They never leave the US, they
 stay there.” Everybody goes, ""I know, but you don't understand it's

 “You better never get pregnant, you better not whatever.” There was never
 any discussion of like what I was supposed to do to avoid getting pregnant,
 but it was just in my head. It's always been like, “All right my parents
 said not to do that so I'm not going to do it.” But I think sometimes it's
 just that it's like, “what else are you going to do,” or “how else do you

 old enough. So, I did it again. I remember the first year and not
 understanding a lot when I first got there. Then I recall the second year
 when I first started preschool being like, “Oh my gosh, I understand
 everything. I know what they're saying, okay!” And just being really happy
 that I was understanding because I had promised my dad I was going to learn
 English when I got there.

 was like, “Oh, I don't need school right now. I'll figure it out

 involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.” Here I think I would still do

 six months.” And that passed, we were finally stuck there and it was
 because of the Hague Convention—if I'm not mistaken—which is like an
 international adoption thing that a lot of countries sign into to try to
 avoid human trafficking for children. Everything that we did with my aunt,
 which was technically live with her for two years, begin the adoption
 process before I was fifteen. All of these things that we did, we were
 supposed to have done them here in Mexico. And we tried to dispute it
 because we were like, ""We've never lived in Mexico and my aunt's not from
 Mexico. Why would we go to Mexico to do this?"" So they're like, ""No, but
 you can keep appealing it. But that's the process, you were supposed to do
 all of that in Mexico."" The point is that we didn't want to, there was no
 reason for us to go to Mexico. We've never been there, my brother left when
 he was one and I was three. So, we were always in the US and so it didn't
 get declined completely, it just got, I guess, on hold and it's been like
 that for the last—when did this happen—like five, six years? So on my end,
 I'm good being here. I like being here, but it's because of my brother and
 his autism and he's very much in his own world of his habits and what his
 plans are and everything. It was really hard for him to come.

 being away from his parents, being with people he didn't really know that
 well. Being in a different country, like language he doesn't speak as
 well—everything was hard. So, I don't touch that process because I know
 it's technically still going on and the hope is that one day he can go
 back. Me, I'd be happy to just go visit once, maybe often. But for him,
 because for him, it's so important to go back to the US.

 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,
 ""You know what, he did something,"" it was, ""You're going to jail,"" just
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, ""There's no way that I'm
 going to get past this."" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was

 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing
 for some time?"" I was like, ""Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going
 to go home, you're going to see your mom."" And then out of nowhere you get
 this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, ""No, no, no, no,

 Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking
 around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].
 So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I
 talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I
 guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it
 and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and
 down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't
 belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and
 I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much
 all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all
 that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal
 ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in
 America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was
 some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for
 detention for two months?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes.
      
      
 Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the
 treatment you experienced there?
      
      
 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""
      
      
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't

 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.

 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I

 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult

 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own

 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me

 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.

 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.

 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the

 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?

 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.
      
      
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,

 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.

12849,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?

 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need

 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts

 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—

 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running

 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""

 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",Lack of mental health resources,Angelo
12850,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound

 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,

 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the

 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of

 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",conflict,Angelo
12851,text,9192,15590,"Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.

",kitchen,Angelo
12855,text,6167,9191,"Angelo: Yes, it was very difficult. Growing up like, up until middle
 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.
      
      
 Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah. So—
      
      
 Isabel: In what grade?
      
      
 Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I
 feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're
 saying I'm doing good."" And I'm sorry, what was the question?
      
      
 Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,
 like refusing those opportunities.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I
 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get
 deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.
      
      
 Isabel: And this is a poem you've written yourself?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes.
      
      
 Isabel: What was it about?
      
      
 Angelo: I think it was a love poem, it was most definitely a love poem,
 yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I love poetry too. I only imagine how awful would be to when you
 pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition
 for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that
 you can't go over.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that ""No, you can't.""
 Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working
 for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,
 what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah, I feel like some students in high school have a hard time
 staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.
 So, like being a high school student and knowing that you can't because of
 the law, I can only imagine being very discouraging in terms of doing that
 work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior
 year, so what happened there and where did you go from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well I dropped out of school because I had a baby. So from then on

 do sports because I didn't feel like I fit in. I never felt like I fitted
 it in. And throughout all my school experiences, I never felt like that
 belong to me because there was many times where I had opportunities for my
 academics to get awards or be presented with some stuff, but I was always
 told ""No, you're not American so you can’t do that. And there's no way that
 you're going to go to another state they're going deport you on the way
 there, we're going to get pulled over.” And so, I really didn't see a
 future there for me.

 interaction with people—like the way you felt othered—or did people
 explicitly say, “You have no opportunity here?”
      
      
 Angelo: Mainly it was my parents. My parents wanted us to keep to
 ourselves. My parents just raised us with that mentality that we're here,
 we're your family, there's nobody else. So you go to school you come home
 and that's it. So, any other projects, and the after-school activities,
 didn't even come to mind because I didn't see it for myself. I couldn't
 seem to picture myself having fun in after-school activities. It was just
 that mindset that, ""Okay, I got to go home because we're not from here and
 something bad might happen.""

 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and

 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.
 
 
     Beto:
 
 
     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]
     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started
     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a
     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a
     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's
     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to
     move forward.

     bullying. You just got out of the school, ""Okay, why are you doing this to
     me,"" and you fight. That's it. No words, no nothing, no bullying. It was
     like, ""I'm not fat. I'm not skinny. I'm not short."" No. Teachers were very,
     very strict. Also, my cousins my age, we lived this experience with the
     teachers who were very strict. You don't do this, you don't do that. I
     remember them having my hands or my fingers together and they had a ruler,

     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad
     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was
     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody
     was like, ""The new guy"" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And
     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL
     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I
     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had
     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that
     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was
     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class
     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling
     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts
     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. ""Huh?
     Okay."" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. ""Okay. I heard about him.""

     How'd you get that result?"" When he looked at me with those surprised eyes
     I was like, ""Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call
     my parents."" Then the girl says, the translator said, ""How do you do it?""

     asking where you-"" ""Mexico."" ""He wants you to teach him how you did that.""

   was happening, not fully. I knew that it was because it was better for the

   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press
   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that
   is my nice phone.”
 
 
   Isabel: You bought with your own money.
 
 
   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to
   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, ""What happened? You
   look so sad."" I was like, ""Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about
   it in the morning."" I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying
   with her, and she was like, ""What happened?"" I was like, “I don’t know
   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the
   beginning.

   someone spends time in the United States, then everyone assumes, oh,
   because you lived in the US for a while, you think you're better or you
   have more money or all these ideas may not even be true.
 
 
   Zayuri: No, it's not even true. So, my father told me, ""You're about to
   turn 18. You go to Mexico."" I was talking about going to college, and he
   said, ""Oh, hell no! You're not getting to college in here."" I was like,
   ""Well, why not?"" He was like, ""Have you ever heard of a student loans?"" I
   was like, ""I think I have seen memes about it. That's about it."" But I
   couldn't understand. Still, right now, it's a very abstract concept to me.
   How can you debt that much money by going to the school? How is going to
   college that expensive? That's crazy expensive.
 
 
   Isabel: No, I know.
 
 
   Zayuri: It's just way too scary for me. He said, ""We can't afford to pay
   college here. If you want to go to university, it's going to be in Mexico,
   and choose a state where you have family because you are going to live with
   them."" So, I went to Zacatecas, and I got into college. I didn't even last
   a semester. I drop out. It was just too much. It was horrible.
 
 
   Isabel: What was difficult?
 
 
   Zayuri: Everything. I mean, being away from your family and having to—I
   mean, they helped me out, or at least that's what my father said, but I
   still had to pay a part of the rent and food services and everything and
   having to work and going to a college at the same time. Also, especially in
   Zacatecas, the salaries, the wages, are so low. It was depressing.

   anything like that.
 
 
   Zayuri: Well, languages I always liked, and art class. Yeah. Music and
   painting mainly. I'm such a stereotype. [Laughs].
 
 
   Isabel: Of what?
 
 
   Zayuri: I'm really a stereotype because I also like things like math and
   all of that. But I wasn't even that good. I like it because I saw it as a
   challenge for myself, but I wasn't even that good.
 
 
   Isabel: Yeah, but that natural curiosity is still pretty unique. Like, oh
   my god, I'm not great at math, but I really love school and I want to do
   well. It would always make me so upset when somebody was naturally just
   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.
 
 
   Zayuri: Yeah. And what is motivating to become better is because right now
   I only speak good English and Spanish. That's it. Now, I've been trying to
   learn German for like a year and a half, but on my own completely, just me
   and the Duolingo and that's it. [Laughs]. But it hasn't been that good. One
   time I was in Zacatecas and I saw a girl, and she was German—I don't
   remember how I figured out that she was German.

   because I also have anxiety. So, the noise really triggers me out, and I
   get headaches and stuff. I was like, ""Yep, got to get out of here.""
 
 
   Isabel: Yeah. You mentioned that you liked school.
 
 
   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].
 
 
   Isabel: I'm the same way.
 
 
   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they
   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I
   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because
   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't
   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and
   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are
   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's
   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes
   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, ""Why do they
   have that and I didn't?"" I'm really happy for them. I understand that they
   are just getting better.

   That's illogical to think. And just to have them be a little more
   understanding of the kids that come back from the States. Personally, I
   went through a lot of discrimination from my own people because I didn't
   perfectly know or understand the language. So, I would like them to try to
   ease on to those kinds of people that come back from the States. And don't
   think that, oh you're made of cash or you're not Mexican because you don't
   speak Spanish. I mean it's not that, it's that we're used to something
   completely different. We went to school in the States, so you couldn't
   speak Spanish in school because all of your teachers spoke English.

   seeing the city, and other Mexican people see them, or hear them, they
   start making fun of them. And it's like, why are you making fun of them?
   There's no point. I have gotten into some conflicts with my cousins,
   specifically, because they think it’s funny for other people to speak
   English when for me, it's a privilege to have been able to speak another
   language other than Spanish. For me, it's an advantage. For my cousins,
   it's a laughing matter, and it does get me angry because I have told them,
   ""I mean, you wouldn't like to be in the States and speak your native
   language and have someone make fun of you and tell you don't speak Spanish.
   No. That's your native language, that's what you know."" Don't make fun of

   Laila: What I would personally like them to understand is, we're not bad
   people. I mean, a lot of people do bad things, yeah. But it's not because
   we're immigrant. Everybody chooses what to do. They choose their own path.
   A lot of immigrant families, like I mentioned, go for a better future for
   their children and for themselves. A lot of them leave their home countries
   not because they want to, but because they have to because of violence,
   because of war, because of a lot of things. A lot of people in the US think
   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they
   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think
   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting
   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to
   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed
   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He
   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside
   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out
   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, ""Get
   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck"" at gunpoint. And he
   was like, ""Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my
   kids are in the car."" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in
   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I
   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he
   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.

   don't have papers. Just because we don't have a paper to validate our
   residency in the States doesn't mean we don't like being there, doesn't
   mean we don't love the US. In my school we used to always pledge our
   allegiance to the flag, you know? And a lot of people would be like, ""Well
   you don't have papers, you're not from here so you shouldn't be doing

   all the opportunities I have. It's just that one paper that I don't have.
   So just to have them be a lot more open minded and open hearted to people
   like that because, honestly, all those things that are said that Mexico
   sends their worst, that's not true. I know a lot of people that were in my
   high school that were actually getting to go on a foreign exchange student
   to Japan and to other places because they were the top of the class or top
   of the state. They were going to the best universities and they were all

   people fear immigrants from other places but it's like, no, you don't think
   we go to the States with fear? You don't think we're scared of being there?

   students had to walk home far distances, scared of their parents going for
   them because they stayed out there for a while and they were stopping cars
   coming out of the school. They stopped the teachers, they stopped everybody
   just because of the color of their skin. You got stopped and you got asked
   for papers or ID, even though a lot of us knew it was illegal for them to
   stay outside of a school and ask for papers.
 
 
   Lizzy: Absolutely.
 
 
   Laila: They still did it and if you refused to answer, they would still
   take you in. It was just mostly a lot of kids leaving school through back
   doors, through the fields, the baseball fields, all of that. They were just
   jumping the fences and leaving because we were really scared to get
   stopped. I remember I had to tell my mom to stay away from the school
   because this was happening. And I actually had a friend who was born in the
   States and her parents were there legally who offered to take a couple of
   kids home because they saw that everything that was happening and that they
   were stopping, like relentlessly, people. Just asking for papers, and so
   they had to carpool a couple of kids home because their parents couldn't
   come close to the school.

   was actually the current sheriff of Arizona, and my high school was mostly
   Latino. Mostly immigrants. We were all mostly from fourteen to seventeen, a
   couple of eighteen-year-olds. And there was one day that there was somebody
   circling, there was a rumor circling that there was going to be a raid
   close to the school. We thought well, it's a school. Why are you going to
   come raid a school? That wasn't even a thought for us.
 
 
   Laila: We went to school, and at the time that we were going out, there
   were sheriffs surrounding the school, stopping parents, stopping students,
   seniors. There was a senior, a girl that we all kind of knew, she was
   really nice to everybody, she got stopped because the sheriff said that her
   back light was out or something like that and it was just an excuse to stop
   her. She didn't have anything. She didn't have papers, so when the sheriff
   told her ""I need to see an ID, I need to see something. She said, ""Well I
   don't have any papers."" So, at that moment she got taken in and sent to a

   of money as well, to re-validate all of your studies so I just got
   completely frustrated, and I told my mom I didn't want to go back to

   school but I'm going to Saturday classes and all that, and I was able to
   get certified for high school. Yeah. But it is really hard to go into

   they don't accept anything. You just have to start from zero. So a lot of

   would do that for them. They received a lot of discrimination at various

   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,
   ""Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I

   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're
   human beings.

   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me

   When I put my mind to it, I get what I want. It sounds bad, but it's true.
   I think the problem with human beings is that you’re your only true enemy.
   You block yourself from doing everything in life, and the moment that you
   accept you can do everything, you can actually do everything [Laughs,

   Luisa: That's what I wanted. I wanted a challenge. I wanted something more.
   I wanted teachers who actually listened. I wanted teachers who paid
   attention. I didn't want teachers who were bored and sick of it because
   these students are like Puerto Rican and gang members and they don't
   matter. I didn't want that. I wanted somebody who cared, but I didn't get
   that. I kind of got it. I got the IB program, which was great [Chuckles].

   as an illegal immigrant, you kind of get the feeling you're a criminal and
   that's the kind of path. That's like, I don't know, you tell that to your
   kid, ""Hey you're illegal"" and that's what they kind of start to think as
   they get older. Like, “Don't trust authority, don't go to the police.” You
   just get in this mindset of wanting to be a criminal because it’s just kind
   of what path is chosen for you.
 
 
  ","Immigration status, Being secretive, Broken system, Hiding/lying",Jesus A
15965,text,16657,18058,"Jesus: Like I said, [Sigh], over here, and I hate to say this, it's like
   law is lawless. Israel has brought this up before too. 1% of crimes get
   solved here. The reality is, if a husband gets mad at their wife, whatever
   amount of violence he brings onto her, chances are it's not going to get
   resolved, and not quickly and it's not going to be fair way. So, I just
   feel like—oh wait, what was the question one more time? Sorry about that.
 
 
   Anita: I was wondering whether women are more jealous or possessive here
   than in the States?
 
 
   Jesus: Yeah. So, I feel like up in the States because the laws are more
   fair, if you hit a woman up in the States, the law's going to come down on
   you. Regardless of whether or not you actually did hit them, or didn't, the
   law's going to come down, and it's going to take it down on the man
   whatever way possible. And so, women over there are more willing to be
   like, ""Hey, you know what? You're messing around with this other girl. I'll
   go mess around with someone else."" So, it's safer for them. They can go out
   to the club and be like, ""This guy, he doesn't mean this. So, I'm going to
   go out with my girls, hook up with another dude.” Over here, if they try
   and do that, sometimes you get the issue of where the guy gets jealous and
   like I said, the crimes don't get solved here very quick, so...

   relationships in the States makes you approach your relationship
   differently than a Mexican woman would. And what are those differences?
 
 
   Jesus: The differences that I've noticed so far, I feel like coming from
   the States and being binational, I'm quicker to move on in the
   relationship. It's like, ""Oh, let's move in together."" Over there, you're
   more independent, there's more money, so you're more willing to get your
   own apartment and be like, ""Hey, just come stay at my place."" And then they
   stay for a week or two. And over here it's like, ""Oh hey, come and stay at
   my place."" And they're like, ""No, I can't do that, because my mom, this and
   that."" And moving in with your partner here, is pretty much like getting
   married. So, it's a big cultural difference there too.
 
 
  ","Relationships, Cultural differences",Jesus A
15967,text,12376,13509,"So,
   sort of in a relationship, how does that cultural difference manifest
   itself?
 
 
   Jesus: Cultural differences? Like I said, she's from the big city too, so
   it's not just the cultural difference, but it's like a big city cultural
   difference too. I don't know. I come from a small town where you don't
   really hang out with your ex. You're not really connected with the people
   that did you wrong because everybody in the town knows each other. Why are
   you going to go and hang out with this person? Especially when you're
   dating someone else. Why would you go back with your ex? But this is such a
   big city, and it makes sense that you wouldn't want to... It's so easy to
   get lost here so why would you want to lose connection with somebody you
   already know? I don't know if that makes any sense. So then for me, it was
   like, 'Why are you still talking to your ex?"" So, a little bit of jealousy
   on my part, but then a little jealousy on her part too. Because whenever
   she'd see me talking to another girl, even if it was work related, it was
   like, ""Why are you talking to her?""

   Jesus: Just being a carrier, connecting semi loads to semi drivers.

   you got to wrap your mind around the entire industry. You're not just
   connecting one person to another. You have to understand all the standards

   that time, my mom was already in the United States. She'd been living in
   the United States for about two years by then. And the circumstances why we
   moved to the States, just seeking better opportunities because by that
   time, we didn't have like a lot, what would you say that ... Here in
   Mexico, we didn't have a stable life. We didn't even have the needs, we
   didn't even have a house. So my mom moved to the States and after two
   years, she brought us to the States. When I first got to the States, it was
   a whole new thing, different language, different people, different culture.
   And not just one culture, it was a mixture. You don't only have people from
   one region, it's like a lot of races, if I can put it that way.

   I put it in words? Mexico is even, I would say, I don't know. I don't know
   about that one. They tried to make changes in the past, but it hasn't
   worked. The major problem here in Mexico is the corruption. It's all of
   Mexico is, the way it is right now, because corruption is just with
   corruption. I will say like, I don't know, I don’t know. I don't know how
   to change that, how would they do that? Because every time a new president
   comes in, they're like, ""Okay, we're going to make a change, everything's
   going to change, no more corruption."" And then they get to the power and
   they forget about that. They want everything for them, so I don't know how
   they will change corruption in this country. Because I will say they, they
   change the whole government. They make a new system, but people still going

   because we're a society, we keep evolving as humans because we've been
   evolving since we were first here in the Earth. And it's not just
   physically, it is intellectual. Your mind just keeps growing and keeps
   growing, keeps growing, keeps growing nonstop. And I think welcoming people
   from another ethnic groups is part of evolution. It's going to happen one
   day. Especially the government now is trying to stop it, but that is going
   to happen someday. And I would say what the United States as a country

   struggle with addiction now?
 
 
   Roberto: Less, yeah, less. I still smoke, I'm still a pothead. But like I
   think the problems are less. Because when I was in the States, man it's

   the States, things have changed. I would like to visit, I would love to
   study. It will be nice studying over there. But I always say that Mexico is
   always going to be a country where you have things in legendary mode. If
   you were playing like a video game, and you put it in hard mode or in
   legendary mode. You'll get stuff, but you have to work for it, like really,
   really, really hard. And in this case in the United States, well, I think
   you have it more easier, a little bit more easy. So if you're successful
   here in Mexico, I think in the States you can be a badass. Yeah, that's
   what I always think.

   Of course, if you have that support, thank God that I had the support of my
   family, part of my mom, that helped us out, and move further. But I think
   if we never had that support, it'll be very difficult, from be to one
   country, well, the economy is better to a different country where it's hard

   pueblito, so I went to school over there, in what, high school? No
   wait…secundaria, middle school, I'd say. So I don't know it was weird
   because like, muchos morenitos y asi, soy y el unico guero... Like the only
   white kid, I was, and it was weird.
 
 
   Sergio: You were the only white kid with green eyes, and did people bully
   you for that, or like what?

   nicknames, funny ass nicknames I got, [inaudible], and tampoco me dejaba, I
   wouldn't let them call me that anymore. I used to get in trouble for that

   most of my family, a part of my mom and dad, are here. So it's like, well
   if my whole family is here, well, I'm Mexican. But I could have family over
   there, but it's like a minor. I mean, it's not like the whole family that I
   have here, and the family that I have in the US. The family that I have in

   Roberto: Like at what age, or?
 
 
   Sergio: What age.
 
 
   Roberto: Well like several years, like when I began living with my dad,
   like when I was in finishing high school, like we were just talking about
   that and he let me know, like that you were not legal there. We were
   supposed to go like to Disneyland, and well we stayed there. We didn't
   return to Mexico, just stayed there. We had a place to stay.
 
 
   Sergio: So before that, did you always think you were a US citizen? Or what
   did you think?
 
 
   Roberto: Well yeah. Well, how can I say? Because like when you're kind of
   you know, young, yeah you don't really think of that stuff. But well yeah,
   I remember that when I used to go to school, like you got to stand for the
   flag, and sing the... It's called-
 
 
   Sergio: Pledge of Allegiance.
 
 
   Roberto: Yeah, to the flag of the United States of America. [Laughs]

   the United States of America."" And that's that. When I was in elementary,
   yeah, lo sabía todo. I used to know it all.
 
 
   Sergio: And did you feel like it belonged to you? I mean you never thought
   you were different, right?
 
 
   Roberto: Yeah, I guess because I'm white. Because like I mentioned, you
   know, I didn't know that I was illegal there. And since I have family that
   was born in the States, so I was like I probably born in the States too.
 
 
   Sergio: So then when you found out, what did that feel like? What was going
   through your mind?
 
 
   Roberto: Oh like, ""Damn. For real?"" I was like, I don't know, yeah, I
   couldn't pictured it, but it makes sense, you know? I think it has like a
   long process to be a citizen. And well, I wasn't born in the States, I was
   born in Mexico. But as well I knew that when I was more a little bit, when

   wasn't doing pretty much well in school, I had issues with my mom I used to
   argue a lot with her, and addiction problems.

   Roberto: Yeah, of course because my mom had the support of my family. And
   well, when she came here in Mexico, yeah well, it's difficult. Like I

   He was there for three years, and then he was able to save up money to have

   know why he chose Utah, but in specific, Provo. That's where I grew up.

   Juan: Yes, Provo [Chuckles]. What my dad always says is that he wanted to
   provide us with a better future because my dad comes from outside of the
   city, like the states in the south of Mexico. He lives in the small
   villages where the houses are still made out of mud or their houses are
   barely standing—where the actual Mexican culture comes from. I guess we
   could say the indigenous people. That's the kind of place that my dad was
   coming from. He just wanted to provide us with a better future than he
   could provide us here in Mexico. He wanted us to go with him to the US and
   to be able to create a better future and better opportunity for us.

   Well, personally, I have family here, my aunt, and she was nice enough to
   allow me to stay in her house. In that part, I didn't struggle to have a
   house, but there's people who do come back and don't have any family here,
   or they do have family, but they've been rejected by them and they don't
   have anywhere to stay. I don't know if maybe having shelters for them.
 
 
   Juan: I know New Comienzos helps people who … Sometimes they do go to the
   airport and they do welcome them to Mexico. I haven't seen any other
   community do that for their own people. New Comienzos does stand out
   because they do go out of their way to make you feel at home. When I had
   just recently got here, New Comienzos helped me out as well and I felt like
   I was part of a community, that I wasn't alone, that I have somebody else
   to help me out.
 
 
   Juan: If maybe helping out New Comienzos grow bigger, or making new
   communities for people who do come back, get deported, help them with
   shelters, work, emotionally. There's a lot of things that the government
   can do, a lot of programs that they can provide. For example, my program
   that I want to give out, making houses out of plastic for people who can't
   afford them. I can make them affordable so they can live there and they can
   have this at home.
 
 
   Juan: Then, build a community where we all help each other, change the way
   people see things here in Mexico, have them have a different point of view
   in life, grow as a community, help each other out. There's a lot of things
   that the government can do, but, unfortunately, won't be done because of
   the current government that we have. When we get into politics, there's a
   lot of things that just— we all see positive things, but with all the
   corruption here in Mexico, it's hard.
 
 
   Juan: Unless we change the government and we put somebody who's a doctor or
   an architect or an engineer to become president and they have a different
   point of view, not just the political view, we won't be able to change
   anything. It's more of a Mexico thing. I guess we're not going so far; we

   the US, do you have suggestions for how it might change?
 
 
   Juan: Right now, the latest news that I heard was they say that for the
   DACA people who have it, they're having a way for them to be citizens in
   the future, that they're not going to remove that. That's a good thing for
   my brother, because he's still over there and he still has DACA. One thing
   that I would want to consider was are the parents who actually do go out
   and who have been living in the shadows, who just go to work, go home, go
   to work and go back home, who just want to provide for their families,
   maybe look into those parents and help them.
 
 
   Juan: I don't know if they get citizenship or get something so they don't
   have to be in the shadows. Because a perfect example, my dad, he's been in
   the US for twenty years now, and he's never received a DUI, he's never been
   in jail. He's received tickets, traffic violations, but in the twenty years
   he's been there, he's maybe had six or five. People like that, or like my
   mom, who's a home … How do you say? A home-stay mother who takes care of
   her daughter, who takes her to school, makes sure that her daughter is not
   home alone, is on top of her school, goes to the parent-teacher conference.
   In a way, maybe look out for those kind of people or immigrants who
   actually don't do any harm to society. I do know there's other people who
   are bad or are out doing trouble, getting DUIs, stuff like that. But
   there's people who hide in the shadows who are good people, hardworking
   people that just want to provide a better future for their family.

   So at the moment, right now, I don't think I will ever adapt to the way
   people are here in Mexico. I don't know if you've met Mexicans who are from
   not the center, but the outside of the cities, their personality is just a
   lot different than a US citizen. They have different thoughts, different
   priorities, which makes them have different personalities.
 
 
   Juan: In that way, I am thankful that I grew up in the US, because the way
   that I am, I consider myself somebody who's humble. I don't really like to
   get in discussions or stuff like that. I'd rather just do my own thing, be

   felony, you can take up to six to twenty years in prison."" Right there, my
   whole life was—I hit the bottom. I was nineteen with a first-degree charge
   and it all went along, my parents, they got me a lawyer.
 
 
   Juan: I was in jail for five months fighting my case and then they found

   Juan: Yes, I wasn't guilty. I was proven innocent, but the thing is that
   since it was a first degree felony, they usually don't drop it down. This
   is what I found out when I was in jail—because you learn things when you're
   in jail—that when you have a first-degree felony, they drop it down to a
   second or third degree and then they give you a plea. How do you say it?
   Yes, a plea.
 
 
   Anne: A plea.
 
 
   Juan: That wasn't my case, because I couldn't live with the felony on my
   record. From a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A
   misdemeanor, so obviously I wasn't guilty at all. I was proven innocent
   after five months [Chuckles].
 
 
   Anne: Couldn't they just wipe it out altogether? Why did it have to be a
   misdemeanor?
 
 
   Juan: Because the state couldn't lose, that's the thing. When you're in
   jail, you learn a lot of things and my lawyer at the moment, he explained
   everything. If we were to take it to trial and the state loses, it's going
   to look bad on them. Obviously, they're not going to let me live clean.
   They're going to want me to take one charge at least. So, what they did
   was, from a first-degree felony, they dropped it down to a Class A
   misdemeanor.
 
 
   Juan: They couldn't take off all of the charges because that would mean
   taking it to trial—it's going to cost a lot of money—so they were like,
   ""Accept the plea deal and then you're free to go, but you will have the
   Class A misdemeanor. With time and with the lawyer, you can remove it from
   your record, but not a felony. A felony will always be on your record.” So,
   I took the deal, and then as soon as I took the deal, I was free to go, but
   immigration got me right there.
 
 
   Juan: Immigration got me, they removed my DACA, and after that I started my
   process with immigration. I was in jail for, in total, eight months. Five
   with the state then three with immigration. I think I would have been able
   to stay if I was married to a US citizen or if I'd had a kid, or if I had
   something that tied me to the US. But since I was nineteen, I wasn't
   married, I didn't have any kids, I didn't have anything that tied me to the
   US.
 
 
   Anne: The Class A misdemeanor, that's one of the misdemeanors that is
   disqualifying for DACA?
 
 
   Juan: Yes.
 
 
   Anne: Did they know? I guess your lawyer knew that this was going to
   happen.
 
 
   Juan: Yes. He knew that they were going to remove DACA.
 
 
   Anne: Though he told you that it's the kind of misdemeanor that you could
   expunge from your record?
 
 
   Juan: Yes.
 
 
   Juan: He did say we can stay, take it to trial, and here's the big dilemma.
   You could either win with the jury or you can lose with the jury. If you
   lose, then you can look up to twenty years in prison. But if you win, you
   live clean you know? But do you really want to take the chance? Taking it
   to trial does take a long time. It can take up to a year or a year and a
   half in jail, and I was already five months in jail. I'm like, ""I don't
   want to be here anymore.""

   Juan: It depends. I could play center mid or forward. But ever since I got
   back to Mexico, I haven't played soccer. I guess it's a personal thing. I
   don't find soccer fun anymore. I did play soccer—my cousin who lives here
   with me, he has a soccer team. All of his friends play with him, but I just
   don't feel like I fit in, so I played a couple of games with his team and
   it doesn't feel the same. I don't feel the same playing soccer as if I were
   to be playing with my friends in the US, so I don't know. It's been a year,
   year and a half, since I played soccer. I just don't feel the same about
   it.

   high school soccer team, so I would talk to all of the white kids, but
   there were people like me who came from Mexico or came from other countries
   from Latin America, who … My friends who were white, they were all nice to
   me, but when they were talking to the other kids that were not in their
   circle, I could see the racist part would come out.
 
 
   Juan: They would tell them, ""Go back to your country,” or “You can't even
   speak English right."" Even if I didn't speak English right, they wouldn't
   tell me anything because I was their friend. Since the other people that
   weren't their friends, they would be mean to them. I guess I never really
   stood up for that. If it doesn't bother me, then I'll just let it be. On my
   behalf, I was lucky enough to be part of their culture, but I know people
   do struggle and people do get rejected in school, in elementary.

   Juan: No, when I went to Utah, I went into 4th grade and then I didn't know
   any English. What did help was that the elementary that I went to, they had
   an ESL—I think it's English Second Language—available for people who didn't
   know any English, so that helped out a lot. My brother and I didn't know
   any English. My mom didn't know any English. My dad didn't know any
   English. It was just rough.
 
 
   Anne: How long did it take to learn?
 
 
   Juan: To learn, I guess you could say by the end of high school my English,
   it still wasn't fluent, but the accent wasn't there as much. After I
   graduated high school, when I was in call centers, that's when I was able
   to practice my English on the daily, and I was trying to copy the way that
   natives spoke it. But it took me 10 years to be able to—

   meaning she had to get smuggled in, so she crossed by walking in the
   mountains. My brother and I … my dad found a lady who had two young sons
   who looked like us. What she did is when it was night time—I was eight, my
   brother was nine, I still remember we were in the back seat—and then, like
   any other family, we crossed the border.
 
 
   Juan: The guy from immigration, he just dimmed his light at us and they let
   us pass, so we didn't struggle. We just crossed with the car like normal,
   but my mom, she did struggle. I think she took three weeks. From what she
   tells me, it's the worst thing that could happen to her. Because whenever
   immigration were close by, they had to hide. I guess it's do or die because
   people do die when they cross the border and she's one of the lucky ones
   that was able to make it back to their families.

   really don't remember—I was six years old. I just remember that I was in a

   but from the beginning, not onto the third grade that I was supposed to be.
   No, in first grade because I didn't know Spanish, and most of the subjects
   that are needed for Spanish. I was great in English. They took my English
   classes away so I can retake Spanish, but on second level. They were
   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I
   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I
   finished middle school. What's been a little bit of problem is high school,
   because I was still... It's not easy to forget old habits. In that moment,
   school was like, I care about it, but not 100%. Since I like soccer, I used
   to go and play soccer in my time in class and all that. That was a problem.
   The distraction, soccer, then all those things I didn't know and stuff like
   that. They even paid me classes for Spanish and for another subject into

   me, even though I'm not their child. They took care of me, and they're
   still taking care of me, even though I'm older. I have my own life. I can

   Maybe when you're a kid, you don't realize it, you just live. But once you
   truly know the love for your family, for your parents, it hits you. Not
   having my dad and my mom when I was in my important point of my life, a
   teenager. Right now that I’m 20. I haven't been with my dad so he can't
   support me. He can't give me that advice, that hug that maybe you would
   like, right?

   an animal for something so small. I'd rather be back in my city as a free
   man and try to earn my right to go back to the States legally and just live
   over there. It wasn't a good thing or a good feeling to be driving around,
   just being anywhere, having a fearing of being detained for any minority. I

   I got kicked out of school, he sort of kicked me out of the house and I
   ended up living with a buddy and I started working with him. Not with him,
   but we started working together and that's when I started making money.

   making enough money to help you out with bills and stuff. I feel like this

   people are in the States. A lot of people think they're just there to take
   their jobs, but it's not. People just want a better life. People just want
   to be part of something. I feel the States is probably one of the best
   countries in the world and it will be for the future because it's a
   culmination of so many countries and so many cultures. You take every other
   culture away, what's there really in the States? Everybody in the States
   was an immigrant at some point and people forget that. A lot of citizens
   that are racist towards immigrants forget that their grandparents at some
   point immigrated from another country for the same reasons they did. I just
   want people to remember that America is a country of immigrants.

   many cultures for me to learn and see. Food. The freedom. The fact that you
   don't really have to worry about the things you have to worry about here.
   Here, you can't even be walking at night. You have to be looking around the
   corner because you never know. There's probably like a 50% chance if you're
   walking out a night, you're probably going to get robbed. And in the
   States, it wasn't ever like that. I remember being 14, 15 walking home from
   a buddy's house at 10 and nothing you know? The security. I felt secure.
   And my friends, honestly. Also, the currency. Currency was like a really...
   How do I say this? It's pretty easy for people to make money in the States,
   you know. And you don't really need to have a really good job to supply
   enough for your house. And even people in low income still have enough to
   survive. And here in Mexico, you got to really hustle really hard to even

   and I cleaned. It was like a misdemeanor. But other than that, I was also
   arrested once prior to that for no license, but at that time immigration
   laws weren't that strict. I was in county jail for like maybe two hours.
   They just fingerprinted me. And they were like, ""Oh, they paid your bail.
   You're good."" I was out. I just went to court, paid my fine, and that was
   it. That was all I ever heard of that. Actually, when I got arrested that
   second time, when I got deported, I didn't even worry at all until I was at
   immigration. I mean, I got arrested and everything. I didn't worry about
   it. Even though at the time I was with my little sister when I got
   arrested, I called my sister to tell her to come pick up the kid. My
   brother-in-law came to pick up the car. They took the car and everything.

   sister and a buddy and his kids. We had gone to McDonald's and I was
   driving back home and I was going like five miles over the speed limit and
   I was pulled over for speeding. Because I didn't have a license, I was
   taken to county jail. At county jail, immigration got ahold on me and
   that's when I went to the immigration detention center and that's where I
   was given my choice of either fighting my case or just leaving voluntarily.
   And I just thought it was the best idea to leave voluntarily and try to
   come back legally. There was a couple of options I could've taken. I
   could've fought my case, but in most cases, it was like a five percent
   chance of winning. It really depended on the judge. I didn't think I was
   going to win. Most of the reason people win is because they have property,
   have kids. They have a reason to be there. I didn't have kids. Even though
   I was a main supplier at the house, main supporter, it didn't matter to the
   judge's eye. So he gave me the voluntary leave and I took it. Thought it
   was my best option.

   evictions. They maintained houses for banks, bank-owned houses. So we
   trimmed the grass, cleaned out the property, whatever. And if a house was
   evicted, like a month ago, we had to go and take out everything the house
   had in it, take it out to the dump. Just maintain the houses until they
   were sold by the bank. Sometimes we did a little bit of touch-ups, paint
   and stuff like that. After that job, I started getting into paint. I
   started painting for maybe a year. And paint was really bad hours and
   really low pay so I started looking for other stuff. Eventually, I did
   tile. I did flooring.
 
 
   Jose: And eventually I started working in framing, where is where I got the
   most money. I think I started with like 80 bucks, but I was only throwing
   trash. I was only picking up scraps, throwing trash, and it was a pretty
   easy job for like 80 bucks. But then I started getting to know the job and
   they started teaching me stuff and I started making like 120, 140 in a day.
   So, then I started liking it. I started putting more effort into learning
   and get a higher position in the job. And I started working until I was a
   master and I was the one... Actually, before I came, I was a group manager
   and since I spoke good English, I was able to talk with the builders and
   since I knew the work and stuff, I started making pretty good money. My
   employer at the moment his English wasn't that good, so I put him onto a
   lot of people. I helped him with work and with managing his business. Yeah,
   that's where I started making like 20, 20 plus. I was also getting bonuses.
   After a house was done, I would get a little bonus for helping out extra.
   Yeah, I started making really good money there. That's when we really came
   up. We used to live in really cheap apartments until we moved up and

   years old, he was the one that acted out the most. I mean, I'm not sure if
   it was to do what I do, to do what the older brother does, or just because
   he was doing it by himself. Like I said, as I grew up, I started working. I
   started getting my head straight. I was being mentored by older people. I
   was working with older people and they were telling me the things I should
   be doing instead of splitting into the wrong way. And I was mentored by a
   lot of people. People that I still keep in touch with now. Coworkers and
   stuff.

   I felt like I grew up best by learning from my own mistakes and being told
   what could happen and then making that mistake and being like I was warned
   about this. I warned my brother about everything. I would just... Since
   that was the mindset I grew up in, I couldn't really help what he was

   for me to understand what the teachers were telling me and all that. During
   middle school, I was actually in advanced classes. The whole advanced
   classes thing was when my parents were splitting up and I started acting
   out and getting into trouble and stuff. And that's what led me into high
   school. Once I got into high school, I was kicked out of all my advanced
   classes because I was acting out in my classes before that. Eventually,
   through that whole year, it was a big downfall for me. As my parents were
   splitting up, I was acting rebellious, trying to get attention.

   get my act together and learn English as quick as possible. There's a bunch
   of classes in the States that teach foreign kids to learn English. Whether
   you're from any Latin American country, Asia, or whatever. I remember being
   an ESL and I remember being surrounded by Hispanics, Asians, and there was
   like a Russian kid.

   it is now. But back then I remember we were driving just on the street. We
   could see the border and then you know the river? The bridge? We got out
   maybe like a couple of miles before that, went into the bushes. We waited
   until nighttime. At nighttime, we went in inflatable rafts. I was on
   somebody's back and they crossed us over one by one. Once everybody crossed
   over, we ran for a couple of minutes to a Walmart. I remember going inside
   the Walmart ‘cause my sister had lost her shoe in the whole running and
   they had bought her a shoe. After the Walmart, we were taken to a hotel
   safe house and we were actually ditched at the safe house. My dad had to
   hire, or pay, for another coyote to go pick us up in Texas—we got stranded
   in Texas. Yeah, another whole different coyote had to come and pick us up.
   And that coyote delivered us from Texas to ____, where I've been living for
   like 16 years.

   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to
   hip hop, like, ""Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.""
   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that
   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,
   they say, ""No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you."" Those
   were the words. I'm like, ""What do you mean?"" It's like, ""Yes. The way you

   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's
   like, ""Wow. So, it was just all about image."" If you look nice, they're
   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or
   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my

   it could be better."" So, I did change for that school, but then I realized
   that my identity or my personality started to change as well. I started to
   become somewhat of a prick. Yes. Then I said, ""No. I can't do that no more.
   I can't."" Because that's how the system takes you in and eventually it's
   not you that changes the system but the system that eventually changes you.

   have everything I have because of that, but I can't lose my identity.""

   for about a year, a year and a half—and they took my mom, me, brother and
   sister all of us at once, about a year and a half after that.
 
 
   Sergio: Did your dad migrate for economic reasons for the family or
   violence or discrimination?
 
 
   Josue: I think that it was money, yeah. But I don’t think that—I think
   money may have been like 50% of it. I think that he was running to start
   anew from something, I don't know, ‘cause we were not in a bad situation

   Sergio: So, what was the hardest thing about it? What were some of the
   challenges you had?
 
 
   Josue: Like I said, I didn't know the city at all to begin with. I didn't
   know anyone down here that could even like tell me how to get a job ‘cause
   I've never had to get a job with papers. You know, the right way. I never
   did that. Yeah, so that would have been helpful.
 
 
  ","Return to Mexico, Challenges, Employment",Josue
19915,text,24112,25445,"Josue: Coming back? Like of the entire process? I mean, being with ICE was
   horrible. And it's horrible because... So the people that have you
   detained, like in Tacoma, they're all American. And they never really
   mistreated us, not really. But whenever they turned us over in San Diego
   with ICE, they all got their last names right here, and every single one of
   them was Latino. You know, ‘cause they got their last names right there.
   They were the ones, you know, that had us up against the bus with our hands
   up with the guns pulled out.
 
 
   Josue: There’s a lot of them. So yeah, they're the ones that were screaming
   at us. They never spoke Spanish, it was always English. I remember one of
   the guys, ‘cause they had us walk in from the airplane to the bus with our
   hands up, and I think somebody put them down—I mean we're still shackled
   up, you know, everything. And they put them down and they all like started
   screaming at him, pointing the gun on him too. So that to me was like the
   worst of the entire thing. Just having somebody that, you know, they're all
   Latinos, treat you that way. I think that was the worst. And I don't know.
   Maybe the other part is the place that you go into after, right when you
   cross the border, they don't really give you any information.

   Josue: No, not that either. ‘Cause I think that it's iffy, like whenever
   you want to use your diploma from the States, they don't just say, “Okay
   you did that and so you can now go on to college or whatever.” I don't
   think it's like that. You have to do something.
 
 
   Sergio: Has that been hard for you with your culinary background?
 
 
   Josue: I mean I wouldn't want to study that. I would actually want to study
   something that I can use here, like business or something, something where
   I can grow. But like I said, from what I've heard—I don't know too much—you
   do have to do something so that they can validate what you did in the
   States down here. But I don't know enough about it. That's it.
 
 
   Sergio: So that's too much for you, you don't want to go through that whole

   if I didn't like one job, I wanted to be able to say, “I don't like this

   right on Fifth Avenue.
 
 
   Sergio: How long were you in County?
 
 
   Josue: It was just a few days, like maybe a week, 10 days.
 
 
   Sergio: How did you feel there?
 
 
   Josue: It was okay. I was in a different area where you really are like in
   a fish tank ‘cause it's all glass right here and the cops are right there
   on like an island and they're literally just looking down at you. So it was
   fine. I mean it was horrible ‘cause it was county, but yeah, they didn't do
   anything wrong.
 
 
   Sergio: You didn't experience any abuse?
 
 
   Josue: No, no. They had us, really just watching us right there. So no, it
   was just the fact that nobody told me anything, they just kept on telling
   me to wait, that somebody would tell me what was happening. And that never
   happened.
 
 
   Sergio: So, if you were detained, you were detained by ICE. How long did
   ICE detain you for?

   Josue: Tacoma, Washington.

   Josue: Oh no, that was fine. Yeah, yeah. I think that was fine.
 
 
   Sergio: You ever have a bad experience?
 
 
   Josue: No. Well the thing is they are not ICE. They're a private company. A
   horrible part there was with ICE, whenever they actually get you to ICE.

19921,text,10481,13973,"Josue: Oh, it was really stupid [Chuckle] Because I was driving my dad's
   car, and I went to a friend’s in downtown Seattle. Left the car parked in a
   parking lot, and then I went to my friend's house, or whatever. I was
   coming back and I didn't have my driver's license with me—I forgot it that
   day. And so, somebody I guess called the cops saying that maybe I looked
   suspicious or something because the cops came, they got me, I didn't have
   my ID, the car wasn't under my name. And so they said that they were
   charging me with car prowling, which at the end they dropped everything
   because that was not the case. And yeah, that's what happened. They took me
   in.
 
 
   Sergio: So, the police detained you?
 
 
   Josue: Yeah, it was the cops. And so, they got me and then I spent a few
   days in County. Ain't nobody told me anything. Like I would ask, like “Why
   am I exactly here? Can I speak with somebody?” And they kept on telling me,
   like “Oh, you're going to get your hearing,” whatever. But I never did. A
   few days after that, ICE came and you know they start asking like, “When
   did you come in? What's your social security number?” All those questions.
   And then they left. A couple of days after that, they came back, but you
   know already with the shackles and everything for a bunch of people. And
   that's how they took us down to the detention center in Tacoma.
 
 
   Sergio: What year was this, that that happened?
 
 
   Josue: 13? 2013.
 
 
   Sergio: So, you never actually went before a judge for this case that the
   cop stopped you for?
 
 
   Josue: Never. I had a persecutor right there when I had my hearing in ICE,
   with a judge, cause I told her, she asked me, “Do you want to fight the
   case? You want to do something?” I said, “No.” And I told her I just want
   to sign the voluntary departure. As soon as I said that, the guy to the
   left, he was like, “No, like he has charges.” They wanted to deport me,
   which wouldn't have made a difference really for me ‘cause I'm not going
   back. But he said, like “He's got this, charges,” whatever. I don't know
   how they can call them charges when they never really charged me with
   anything ‘cause I never had a hearing on it. And so then I explained
   exactly what I said to you. I told the judge, she turned and looked at him
   and the guy said, “Okay, we're deferring the charges.” That's just what he
   said. And she said, okay, she signed it. That's it. [Chuckles].
 
 
   Sergio: That's wild.
 
 
   Josue: It was.
 
 
   Sergio: So, they just looked at you and they were like, “Okay, we're
   dropping everything?”
 
 
   Josue: Yeah, yeah, yeah. The persecutor just said, he used that term,
   “We're not dropping the charges, we're deferring the charges,” something
   like that. She said, “Okay,” signed it. And that's how I got the voluntary
   one.
 
 
   Sergio: So, were you informed of your rights during this process?
 
 
   Josue: No, I would say no. No because whenever I explained it to the judge,
   I told her like, “Whenever I was in county, nobody ever told me anything. I
   didn't know anything of whether we're charging me with. Whenever ICE came,
   same thing. They just took me and didn't say anything.”
 
 
   Sergio: Did you have a lawyer helping you through it?

   what's funny is before I actually came to Mexico, about a year before, I
   called my mom and I told her that I wanted to come back. So like nine
   months after that, that's when I got caught. So first I had bail, and then
   whenever I had my meeting with a judge, like my hearing, she asked

   come back to Mexico. So, here, I had to go back to middle school for like
   four months and then to high school again.
 
 
   Tim: You guys came back voluntarily?

   want to go to school. I didn't understand what the teacher said to me. I
   didn't like going to school because I didn't understand anything. Then they
   started giving me like, ""Okay, you are going to be half your time here and
   half your time in a Spanish class."" So that kind of helped me understand.
   And then when I was like in second grade, then they're like, ""Okay, you're
   ready to be in a full English class."" Yeah.

   months, five months, I was always the new girl. I would be changed from
   school super often. So I've been to a whole bunch of schools. The only
   school I remember that I went three years straight was Shiloh Park
   Elementary School. I went there three years straight, which was from third
   to sixth grade. But then when I was going to go middle school, we ended up
   changing to another city.
