   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that
   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…
 
 
   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave
   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,
   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone
   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who
   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad
   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,
   ""Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I
   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The
   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on
   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.
 
 
   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with
   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this
   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.
 
 
   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?
 
 
   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my
   dad after three, four years?
 
 
   Anita: You asked him to take you back?
 
 
   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't
   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, ""No,
   that's not happening with us.""
 
 
   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?
 
 
   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking
   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my
   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're
   human beings.
 
 
   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or
   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me
   leave the room. She was like, ""I can't see you right now. Leave the room.
   You're so much like your dad. Leave."" It really affected her. I get it.

   Luisa: [Sniffles] Because of my mom, I got to meet extremely interesting
   people that opened up my worldview more so than it already was, because
   reading transports you to different places and different languages and
   cultures and you learn so much, and you feel like you have actually been
   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, ""You
   know what? I'm going to be independent,"" so she moves aside. She starts her
   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.

   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to
   watch. We went to their homes, I think—[Pause] I don't remember his name,
   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the
   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their
   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.
 
 
   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,
   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the
   attire?
 
 
   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would
   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took
   over.
 
 
   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he
   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, ""Oh, my God. What's
   happening?"" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually
   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,

 paperwork, no drivers, no identification, and I had a harder time getting a

 ID here—the toughest time here then I did getting ID in the United States.

 somebody going to work over there and pay $6,000 to a coyote, they could
 pay $1,500 at a processing center to apply and get placed in a job by the
 US government legally. But you know what? US government don't wanna do
 that, because they want to keep them costs down. And so, does private

 them a bus ticket and some type of cash, to get him back to his place of
 origin. Job opportunities, some type of government incentive for employers
 to hire new arrivals.
      
      
 Ben: Some type of, I want to say grants, there should be some type of
 assistance to help, some type of temporary housing assistance, maybe in
 monetary assistance or vouchers, something. Not just dumping. One of the
 things that's causing a lot of crime right along the border is you take
 1,000 people a day and dump them, right there on the border and they don't
 have no food, they don't have nothing. And these gangs come along, they
 have an endless army supply, they can supply their armies and never run out
 of people as long as they're dumping people right there. Because you're
 dumping people there with no money, no food, nowhere to go. There's
 shelters, but them shelters are full.

 would help me, not just in my business, but in personal wealth later. For

 the courses that I focused on. And then the other course was psychology--
 definitely something that I knew would help. Then real estate finance
 because I figured later with accumulating some money I could invest in real
 estate. Understanding real estate finance was a very very important factor
 in me being able to grow my business later. I didn't know that at the time,
 but later I purchased my first home and then we purchased a home up in
 Indianapolis. And then when I hit a point where I needed to grow, I had the
 opportunity to take bigger jobs and bigger contracts, I didn't have that

 the house, take the property, rent it out to somebody to pay that, or lines
 of credit and then we'd do a job, I'd get the money, pay that loan off, and
 free that line of credit up later on. But apart from that, I did take all
 the basic arts classes, English, algebra, I had some calculus and

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.
 
 
     Beto:
 
 
     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]
     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started
     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a
     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a
     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's
     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to
     move forward.

     to Disneyland?"" ""Yes."" ""Mickey mouse is big?"" But that's simple stuff. They
     don't ask much. I'll give you another example. I had a friend that didn't
     know, ""Hey, what is a money order?"" ""That's like a voucher. We don't have
     these here."" “Oh, that's a money order.”

     because they're getting money, and they're learning English. That's the
     25%. Some of them, because they're in school, they learned it maybe by
     playing games. When we're in training and we have to actually introduce
     ourselves, I'm amazed that they learned English playing games online or by
     watching movies. I was like, it took me a lot in the States to learn
     English because I was just listening to English. But it took me a little
     while and they're just like, ""Oh I learned it by watching, I don't know,
     Finding Nemo and Toy Story.” I'm laughing at all of it, ""Yeah you did.
     Yes."" We've had this guy introducing himself, he actually knew the Toy
     Story song and I was like, ""Yes, you did learn English with Toy Story.""
     That's the 25%. Some of them, they do need it because they're actually in
     school here, they study they're actually just trying to keep on learning
     and move on.

     You get to learn too. That's one of the advantages because you're learning
     too, because you're managing money, people's money, you actually get to
     know. I mean, on my end, that's what I've learned. I don't talk bad about
     the call centers. I learned a lot. I never, well, in the States I never had
     a credit card due to the fact that I was an illegal immigrant. But here I
     have been managing people's credit cards, and it's like, ""Oh, I didn't know

 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,
 ""You know what, he did something,"" it was, ""You're going to jail,"" just
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, ""There's no way that I'm
 going to get past this."" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was

 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing
 for some time?"" I was like, ""Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going

 around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].
 So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I
 talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I
 guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it
 and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and
 down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't
 belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and
 I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much
 all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all
 that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal
 ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in
 America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was
 some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped

 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""
      
      
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.

 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.

 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to

 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.

 you never wanted to be.

 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.

5123,5123,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're

 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that

 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",physical,Angelo,1,3.0
5124,5124,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",conflict,Angelo,1,3.0
5125,5125,text,9192,15590,"Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.

 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are

 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.
      
      
 Isabel: That's definitely college level [Laughs].
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah. So—
      
      
 Isabel: In what grade?
      
      
 Angelo: I was in the eighth grade. And so that was awesome for me because I
 feel like, “Okay, I'm not from here, but they're praising me, and they're
 saying I'm doing good."" And I'm sorry, what was the question?
      
      
 Isabel: No, no, that was perfect. I was just saying it's a hard dynamic,
 like refusing those opportunities.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. And so after middle school, I was also into poetry a lot. I
 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that
 risk of if we go, we're going to get pulled over, and we're going to get
 deported. So, you can't receive that certificate.

 pour yourself into a piece of art, like poetry, and then get recognition
 for it, and how amazing that feels, but then having that last hurdle that
 you can't go over.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah. So, once we got that established that ""No, you can't.""
 Basically, for me it was like, “So what's the point? So what am I working
 for? If I finish high school, I'm not going to be able to go to college,
 what's the point?” And I really never saw a future after middle school.

 staying motivated knowing that they might be able to go to college someday.

 work. You mentioned you stopped going to school midway through your junior

 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are

   I knew it so I was like, ""Dude, I'm done.""

   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next
   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.
   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I
   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out
   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going
   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.
 
 
   Mike: So they were like, ""Dude, you got to do something. You either going
   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to
   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do
   a voluntary departure and you go."" At that time I felt like I wasn't any
   good to anybody. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family."" So I just
   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran
   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was
   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I
   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just

   Laila: What I would personally like them to understand is, we're not bad
   people. I mean, a lot of people do bad things, yeah. But it's not because
   we're immigrant. Everybody chooses what to do. They choose their own path.
   A lot of immigrant families, like I mentioned, go for a better future for
   their children and for themselves. A lot of them leave their home countries
   not because they want to, but because they have to because of violence,
   because of war, because of a lot of things. A lot of people in the US think
   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they
   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think
   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting
   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to
   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed
   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He
   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside
   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out
   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, ""Get
   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck"" at gunpoint. And he
   was like, ""Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my
   kids are in the car."" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in
   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I
   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he
   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.

   She says that one of them told her to go home. Not risk her kids and there
   was no reason for that. [Pause] There was no reason for that [Chuckle], but
   I guess my mom says she's very stubborn. So she wanted to reunite her
   family and we were able to cross on the fifth time [Chuckles].

7018,7018,text,171,2198,"Laila: Well, I was actually three years old when my parents decided to go
   to the States looking for I guess, a better life. That's what my mom has
   always told me. She took me and my nine-year-old brother across the border
   walking when they decided to go. My dad actually went first and then we
   went second. I lived there for around thirteen years, mostly all my life.
   Yeah.
 
 
   Lizzy: You surely were too young to have any memories of walking across the
   border or—
 
 
   Laila: I vaguely remember it was very cold because it was nighttime. We
   actually got detained four times before being able to cross.
 
 
   Lizzy: Wow.
 
 
   Laila: Yeah. One time the border patrol was actually very nice to us and
   gave us water and all that, but that was a very long time ago.
 
 
   Lizzy: And you say one time they were nice to you out of four times?
 
 
   Laila: Yeah.
 
 
   Lizzy: Do you know what the other times were like?
 
 
   Laila: Well, mostly from my mom that she has actually told me most of what
   happened. She says that the first couple of times we were detained, they
   were just taken back and left at the border. Just go away, go home. There
   was one time she was actually carrying me. She actually carried me the
   whole time because I was three so and she says it was around rain time. The
   shrubs were very tall and all the spines and all that. She didn't want me
   to get injured, but she actually fell on a rock and got a hole in her knee
   and she couldn't walk. When the border patrol saw that, they aided her and
   they gave us water and they wanted to help her. They couldn't really give
   her medical treatment, but they just helped her get back across the border.

   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to
   hip hop, like, ""Oh, you're a drug addict. You're bad. You're a criminal.""
   That has always been the issue. I felt discriminated because of that
   because I'd dress like I do now with my hats. I would go ask for a job,
   they say, ""No. I'm sorry. We're not looking for people like you."" Those
   were the words. I'm like, ""What do you mean?"" It's like, ""Yes. The way you
   have tattoos, the way you dress. We're not looking for people like you."" I
   said, ""What does that have to do with my knowledge? I'm probably smarter
   than that guy right there. What does that have to do with my knowledge?""
   ""No."" Because I had piercings also. Then it's, ""Because our image is not
   like that."" I was like, ""Why?""
 
 
   Sylent:
 
 
   Every job I try to go get, it was like, ""No."" I was shut down. I learned
   that here in Mexico it's all about image. I just changed a little, started
   wearing dress shoes, maybe tighter pants, maybe dress shirts. I would go
   back to the same places and they would welcome me with open arms. It's
   like, ""Wow. So, it was just all about image."" If you look nice, they're
   going to treat you nice. Depending on how you dress and how you speak or
   how you drive yourself, that's how people treat you. I took that to my
   advantage and said, ""Okay. I need to do something."" That's when I said,
   ""Okay, maybe teaching is a good opportunity since everybody's asking."" I
   started looking for schools.
 
 
   Sylent:
 
 
   Then there was this one school that they said, ""Hey, I don't care how you
   look, just you do need to change some things, but I'm not asking you to
   completely change yourself. Just so that you can seem legit."" I'm like,
   ""Okay. I can do that, I guess."" I was only 18, 19 years old so I was like,
   ""Am I ready to change or do I want to change even?"" I said, ""Why not? Maybe

   just thought, ""Oh, yeah, it's cool."" I did want to be part of something,
   obviously. I didn't want to feel left out. I did have family members that
   did represent them more than that. I thought it was just normal.

   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such
   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of
   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say
   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a
   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four
   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my
   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a
   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.
 
 
   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the
   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I
   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that
   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned
   black. I was like, ""Okay, this is not good."" It did turn off. It did turn
   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,
   ""Okay."" So, I was like, ""It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I
   could just live with just one. That will be okay."" I was trying to not pay
   that much attention to that.
 
 
   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It
   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple
   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,
   ""Yeah, this is okay."" I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing
   for the phone. I was like, ""Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this
   one."" Then I got robbed. They took that phone—
 
 
   Isabel: In the same day?
 
 
   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw
   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even
   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, ""Yeah,
   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?"" And they didn't
   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was
   trying to scam him. They were like, ""Yeah? He took your phone? And why do
   you have one right there?"" And I was like, ""I can prove that they're both
   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,
   whatever you ask me."" They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?
 
 
   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?
 
 
   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, ""Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure
   that you can do that."" It was like, ""No, there's no witnesses. We can't do
   anything about it."" I was like, ""Okay. I think I'm going to leave right
   now."" I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was
   on that phone. I was like, ""I don't know how am I going to get to my
   house,"" and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, ""Okay,
   can you guys take me there?"" I said that to the police officers. They were
   like, ""No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area."" I was
   like, ""So, what do I do now?"" They were like, ""Take a taxi."" I was like,
   ""Okay.""
 
 
   Zayuri: I remember that I was so depressed because when I saw the police
   officers, I was like, ""Yes! I'm going to get my things again!"" I didn't
   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,
   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if
   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press
   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that
   is my nice phone.”
 
 
   Isabel: You bought with your own money.
 
 
   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to
   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, ""What happened? You
   look so sad."" I was like, ""Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about
   it in the morning."" I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying
   with her, and she was like, ""What happened?"" I was like, “I don’t know

   Zayuri: Yeah, I have always been a huge nerd. [Laughs].
 
 
   Isabel: I'm the same way.
 
 
   Zayuri: No, I really enjoy it. For example, nowadays, my brothers, they
   have better opportunities than what I had. For example, the things that I
   know about languages and music is because I looked for my way and because
   we were there. But growing up, my father always told me that we couldn't
   afford classes, and we couldn't afford to go to different schools and
   special schools for that. Now they're having it. Now that my brothers are
   here in Mexico, my father—well, my mom—because they separated. Now she's
   taking them to the languages school, and she's taking them to music classes
   and all of that. To be honest, I'm not jealous. I'm not like, ""Why do they
   have that and I didn't?"" I'm really happy for them. I understand that they
   are just getting better.

 have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in

 go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see

 they could say, ""Hey, your dad's never there."" He's like, ""No, but he's
 always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him

 wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't
 have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from

 weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just
 felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were
 going to grow up and be like, ""Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did
 everything. He's the one that get the money."" She's like, ""I want to feel

 right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix
 things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,

 have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over

 phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,
 anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a
 year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the

 or they had to pay and it wasn't good.

 not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom
 provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and
 be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing
 something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they
 need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than

   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I

   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long
   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad
   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a
   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,
   though. Not like the one they have here, right?
 
 
   Anne: Yeah, cool.
 
 
   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,
   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just
   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go
   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went
   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they
   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There
   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think
   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.
 
 
   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them
   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't
   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so
   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.

 there. Sometimes a lot of it was because of fear of if you get in trouble.
 You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like … I was always
 told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many
 of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get
 into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.
 But I was always like, “No, because if something happens to me or the
 police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would
 involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.” Here I think I would still do
 the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, “You
 can't go out.” I'd be like, “Okay.” I'm still very obedient. All right, I
 don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with

 have … I don't know, I probably would have started working a lot younger

 progress into being a woman” unfortunately like other than with a child or
 with a partner even though it's by mistake.
