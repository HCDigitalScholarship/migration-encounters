   them. That's saying a lot because [Chuckles]—
 
 
   Anita: What did your mother tell you? Did she tell you you're not allowed
   to tell this? This is a secret and—
 
 
   Luisa: Yes, this is a secret. My mother did not allow us to talk about it.
   Even when it came up, I could feel my heart shake and my palms get sweaty
   because I was so scared of getting deported. That was such a big thing. I
   remember we went to this science center. The Argonne Science
   Facility—research facility. It's in Illinois, and when you go in—I'm not
   sure what kind of testing they're doing there—[Chuckles] but they ask you
   if you're an American citizen or not.
 
 
   Luisa: J___, who was a friend of mine, was undocumented and she said, ""I am
   undocumented. I am a Mexican citizen. I am not an American."" She was put
   into a little room and she was not allowed to go in. She was just caged in
   there and that was very … that marked me like, no, I can't tell anyone. I'm
   seeing what's happening to these people. I can't tell anyone, so nobody
   ever knew.

   question and then I want to ask you about being undocumented. You said that
   you didn't see your dad for a long time, and then all of a sudden…
 
 
   Luisa: Yes, my dad hired somebody to find us. My mom really did not leave
   any trace at all. She just pretty much left like a thief in the night,
   literally [Chuckles]. They eventually tracked us down and I got a phone
   call. We got a phone call. I think it was one of my grandparents who
   answered. Very reluctantly, they handed over the phone and it was my dad
   and I remember crying. I remember being hysterical. I remember being like,
   ""Oh, my God. This is my dad. He's here. This is my dad. He's not gone.”
   It's weird, but I thought it was two different worlds and, in this world, I
   no longer can have my dad. That was the way I started to cope with it. The
   States were not my dad and this is where my dad was, so we were on
   different planets now. It was not something that was possible.
 
 
   Luisa: Then my dad came to visit and I remember begging him to take me with
   him, and my mom was not having it. She was not having it at all. By this
   point, I think he had already remarried, but she was not having it.
 
 
   Anita: Your dad came when you were how old?
 
 
   Luisa: My dad came when I was about nine. That was the first time I saw my
   dad after three, four years?
 
 
   Anita: You asked him to take you back?
 
 
   Luisa: I begged him. I begged him to take me with him. [Pause] That didn't
   happen, my mom was not having that shit [Chuckles]. She was like, ""No,
   that's not happening with us.""
 
 
   Anita: But she allowed him to see you?
 
 
   Luisa: She allowed him. Honestly, I respect my mom a lot for never speaking
   badly upon my dad. To this day, she will not say bad things about my
   father. Whatever may have happened with them, she knows that that's on them
   and she knows that our relationship with my father is completely separate
   from their relationship, and I admire that greatly because I don't think
   I'd be able to separate the two that easily. No, she never spoke badly upon
   him, but I think ... My dad said this in the entire life that I'm his
   favorite child, and I think that was also the way of my mother getting back
   at him for everything that he did to her, which is not right, but we're
   human beings.
 
 
   Luisa: When I would read, I would make certain facial expressions or
   gestures that reminded my mom so much of my dad that she would make me
   leave the room. She was like, ""I can't see you right now. Leave the room.
   You're so much like your dad. Leave."" It really affected her. I get it.

   reading transports you to different places and different languages and

   there, but you've never been. It's funny, but that's how it works. My mom,
   she started working for this store [unclear] and she was doing her design
   school, and they specialized in Muslim attire and my mom was like, ""You
   know what? I'm going to be independent,"" so she moves aside. She starts her
   own thing, and she starts making a bunch of clothes.

   spoke Arabic with my mother and it was extremely [Chuckles] interesting to

   but my mom was extremely close to the main, main, main Muslim figure in the
   United States because there are not a lot of people who specialize in their
   attire. It's a very limited market. I think there's only about two or three
   stores that actually do it in the entire United States, and my mother was
   independent, so she was doing well for herself in that regard, and it was
   great. I got to meet a lot of people.
 
 
   Anita: Was that strange that a Mexican woman was designing Muslim attire,
   either for your mother or for the people for whom she was designing the
   attire?
 
 
   Luisa: It was strange at first, and I would see their faces when they would
   come like, “What…?” Then it just became normal. They became normal. It was
   completely normal. They were friends in the end. My mom was friends with
   some of these people in the very end. My mom's a beautiful human being. It
   was strange at first, but I think it was great. Ismael [Exclamation],
   that’s his name. His father died. He was the biggest figure and he took
   over.
 
 
   Luisa: His wife or his ex-wife was Mexican. He spoke perfect Spanish, so he
   and my mother were very—they would joke around. It was extremely funny to
   watch because when other people were around, this big, big figure would
   joke around with my mom and everyone would be like, ""Oh, my God. What's
   happening?"" But my mom was just that kind of person. His sons, I actually
   grew up with. I know his sons, extremely handsome, very educated people,

   eventually my uncle's wife. One of my uncles got the opportunity to move to
   Chicago—a job opportunity—so he moved. I think after my parents divorced,
   all of my uncles saw us as their kids, because two of the ones that really
   took care of us never really had kids, so they loved us and they brought us
   in.

 stables, they would talk to us in English and they would give us candies,
 they would let us watch TV. But my father also had a tape recorder and he
 had some English cassettes. And, when dad was at work, my mother would have
 my brother and I sit there, and to us at first it was like a game, to be
 able to punch the play and the rewind and all that. It did help and that's
 the first actual learning encounter, as far as applying yourself to try to
 learn, was that little recording machine.

 American kid?

 high school, the high school I went to, there was very few Hispanics-
 period, very few blacks.","Time in the US, School, High school, Friends, Diversity, Social acceptance",Ben

 first, but then I was persistent and everything just, it just changed from
 one day to another. But it was really rough going at first; it was like
 working, working and then this money comes in and then it goes all out. And
 then finally, poof and from there everything changed.

 went mainly into construction, stayed with drywall and did really well.

 stayed working there and then I need to go back to school. I didn't want to
 go back and start and be behind the class. So, I became aware of the GED
 program. So, I went and took the GED program, I didn't even study for it, I
 just went and took it and passed it. And I started taking community college
 courses before my classmates graduated [Laughing]. Already had a jump on
 them!

 school to go help my father. He started a small construction business, but

 kindergarten—my brother would get out an hour later—I would get home and my
 mother would give me these little comic magazines, Mexican comic magazines,
 and she'd have me read them. And then she would make me write letters to my
 grandmother. So that's how I was able to learn a little bit of, keep the
 Spanish and English.","Time in the US, Mexican traditions, Spanish language",Ben

 parents decide to take you?
      
      
 Ben: Well, they decided to take me because of hardships here. My father
 had already left to the United States. He was already working over there
 when I was born. My brother was over, I had an older brother, but he left
 to go work over there. Then, once I was born, he came back, gathered my
 mother, my brother and I, and took us with him, back to Dallas, around the
 outskirts of Dallas.
      
      
 Ben: He was good with horses, so he was working at a horse stable, a
 very prominent horse stable, that caters to most of the people around SMU,
 or Southern Methodist University, that keep all their horses there. So,
 mainly it was to give us a better life, because things are bad around that
 little town. There's no opportunities.

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.
 
 
     Beto:
 
 
     Like I told you, a dead-end point, because you might get to be a general
     manager, right? You're relying a lot on the companies, on the accounts, I
     should say the accounts because a call center, they also rely on the
     accounts. If the account moves and you already become a general manager or
     supervisor, if they moved back to States, you're going back to [_____]
     again. You go back to [_____], you go back to start at where you started
     from, like the beginning. I decided to stay where I'm at, which is just a
     regular agent. I mean I don't have any problems, such as if I become a
     supervisor then the money that you get, it's like, I was getting this much
     for now I'm going back to zero. I'm going back to my regular pay. That's
     the way I see it. After that, you hit the wall. You don't actually get to
     move forward.

     They were happy because they didn't know what I was going through. I never
     told them my experiences at school because of the respect I have. I knew if
     I would tell them something that I was going through, because of Mexican
     culture before, they were very strict. I was afraid of telling them, ""You
     know what, I'm going through this struggle at school, these difficulties""
     because my dad would tell me, ""You're just going to study. That's why
     you're going. You're just going to study. Don't pay attention to anything,
     and I don't want you to do anything stupid. You're to go to school and
     that's it.""

     I knew his answer already. I knew what he was going to tell me, so I just
     decided just to continue with my stuff. Now that I'm older. We have this
     conversation. I had this conversation with him. ""Did you know about me
     having these difficulties with Chicanos, with black people? Did you know
     they wanted me to become a gang member? Did you know all this?"" ""No. How
     come you didn't tell me?"" ""Because I was afraid of you knowing that I was
     having this problem because I knew you weren't going to do nothing. You,
     you, you were not going to take me back to Mexico because we were already
     here."" He's like, ""I didn't know.""

     mean we have this argument, because you took maybe something off me but not
     because of a street. We know it's stupid. We're like, ""Oh, that's your

     [37:17] I went to middle school. I learned the hard way because my dad
     actually just put me into school like from one day to another, and it was
     like I was in the middle of nowhere. I felt like a little ant. Everybody
     was like, ""The new guy"" but I didn't know what they were talking about. And
     you feel very, very tiny listening into everybody. They put me into ESL
     classes as well. Now that I'm 41 years old and trying to remember when I
     was like 13 years old, I'm thinking at that time it was 1991 when they had
     these ESL classes. Where did they get these ESL classes from? At that
     moment, there wasn't that many immigrants. Everything in California was
     pack of Americans. It was an all-American state. They had this ESL class
     that they put me in. Most of my friends talked in Spanish. I was feeling
     like home. But it was just a certain class for me to learn how to say parts
     of my body and clothing. After that you need to go to history class. ""Huh?
     Okay."" You got to learn who is Abraham Lincoln. ""Okay. I heard about him.""

     How'd you get that result?"" When he looked at me with those surprised eyes
     I was like, ""Oh, I think I did something wrong. Oh no, he's going to call

     as I mentioned before, for me to get stuck in a call center is a dead-end
     point. You don't go farther than what you're expecting to. This I learned,
     maybe I didn't also tell you about the story that I have encountered all
     over the call centers, which got me to getting my own business, a small
     little business, which is like a little grocery store. I found out that
     every time I used to go to a call center, I used to go down the stairs, try
     to get something to eat, a snack, and I saw this guy selling a lot of stuff
     down there. I used to give them almost like 50 pesos every time I went down
     to eat. That's when I was like, ""Okay, what am I doing here? They're making
     more money than I'm making, and they're just here for a couple hours.""
     That's one of the things I actually encountered in the call centers. You're
     there for eight hours. Nowadays, you don't get your lunch paid, which is
     like, it's another hour extra of your life because you have to travel two
     hours from your house all the way to work and then you have to travel back
     two hours from work to your house. It's very difficult.

 sunlight, because I remember we were in a trunk at one point. And my family
 tells the story as a joke, I guess it. But it seems that they forgot us in
 the trunk for a little while. So yeah, that would be my earliest memories
 of you know, me being in the United States, getting out of the trunk and
 going to Walmart, trying to buy clothes, and just seeing everything brand
 new, everything was completely different. Honestly, that's the only thing
 that I can remember because I really don't have much memories of me being
 young not even here in Mexico. I can't remember.

 have been... Somebody should have said this is not right. Somebody
 should've said the police report is not right. I promise anybody could read
 the police report and it makes no sense, it makes no sense whatsoever. And
 I just feel like somebody could have said, ""Well, hold on, this makes no
 sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened."" But it was never,
 ""Okay, what happened?"" It was always, ""Okay, you did this."" So that's where
 I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had
 no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the
 bad guy because a little baby got hurt.
      
      
 Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were
 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,
 ""You know what, he did something,"" it was, ""You're going to jail,"" just
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, ""There's no way that I'm
 going to get past this."" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was
 not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was
 different, I was completely—
      
      
 Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through
 things in jail of all these things, I told myself, ""Why are you here then?
 You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why
 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing
 for some time?"" I was like, ""Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going
 to go home, you're going to see your mom."" And then out of nowhere you get
 this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, ""No, no, no, no,
 no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No."" And so it
 was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.
 The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation
 that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all
 I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not
 being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or
 recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very

 sense at all. You know, let's ask him what happened."" But it was never,
 ""Okay, what happened?"" It was always, ""Okay, you did this."" So that's where
 I saw the bad side of the United States legal system where I literally had
 no voice—and mainly being in Texas. I mean, in Texas literally, I was the
 bad guy because a little baby got hurt.
      
      
 Angelo: And so it was very hard, it was very hard. Even in jail there were
 people that would fight their cases and just because a woman said
 something—you didn't even have to actually do it—just because a woman said,
 ""You know what, he did something,"" it was, ""You're going to jail,"" just
 because of an outcry. So having this case of a little baby being in Texas,
 and just hearing all these stories, I was like, ""There's no way that I'm
 going to get past this."" And literally the very first offer was 30 years.
 30 years, super aggressive, they put in that out of those 30 years, I had
 to do minimum 25 years. And it was just so scary for me because that was
 not me, I wasn't what they had on paper. I was not that person, I was
 different, I was completely—
      
      
 Isabel: Opposite of the criminals that you were surrounded by?
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And just hearing all these stories of people going through
 things in jail of all these things, I told myself, ""Why are you here then?
 You're not supposed to be here. Why am I still here after six months? Why
 am I still here after a year? Why am I still here after me finally signing
 for some time?"" I was like, ""Okay, it's all going to be over. You're going
 to go home, you're going to see your mom."" And then out of nowhere you get
 this paper that says order of deportation and you're like, ""No, no, no, no,
 no, no, no, no. That's not what's supposed to be happening. No."" And so it
 was like literally the world ended, and everything was taken just so fast.
 The only things that I have left is pictures just because of the situation
 that happened, I am not on good terms with the mother of my kids. And all
 I'm left with is pictures and just memories and that's the hardest. Not
 being able to just have some type of context, some type of pictures, or
 recent pictures and updates, something, something, something, it's very
 hard.

 Isabel: Why do you think that is?
      
      
 Angelo: Because just everywhere that I go, I have a certain way of walking
 around. I smile at everybody, I smile and nobody smiles back [Both laugh].
 So everybody just looks at me weird. And whenever I talk on the phone, I
 talk loud, I laugh when I'm on the phone, I don't hide my laughter. And I
 guess just the way that I eat, walk, the way that I talk, people notice it
 and there's times where I get stared at or people just look at me, up and
 down with that face that you think you're better than us, or you don't
 belong here. And I feel more American just because I grew up in America and
 I'm used to things being done right. Not so much corruption, not so much
 all this other stuff that goes around, people hitting on each other and all
 that stuff. So I just want Mexico to be somewhat like America in the legal
 ways, just because I'm so used to things being... it wasn’t 100% in
 America, everything wasn't 100% right, but there was justice, there was
 some type of justice and I don't feel like that's something done here.

 from your dad, but it seems like you had to ask for help there. I skipped
 one part of the story and I just want to backtrack because I think it’s
 important. You were held by ICE [Immigrations and Customs Enforcemen] for
 detention for two months?

 Isabel: Two months. Do you mind just touching on the conditions or like the
 treatment you experienced there?
      
      
 Angelo: As soon as I got into immigration…it was Houston. So I mean the
 immigration center, was, I can't say it was things falling down, things
 breaking apart, it was all right. What the thing that was scary, very scary
 was that before the first time that I went to court just talking to people,
 they will tell me that they'd been there three, four years fighting their
 case. And they had moms and dads that were United States, residents,
 citizens, and they were still there fighting their case. And I would ask
 them, ""If you don't fight your case, what happens? And they said, ""Well,
 you know, they deport you tomorrow."" And I called my dad and I told him,
 ""Look, dad, I don't want to be here three, four years. I don't want to be
 here. I'll sign my deportation.""
      
      
 Angelo: And whenever I went to court, even though I had already told that
 to my dad, I still tried to fight for me being there, I talked to the judge
 and the judge told me, “You have a criminal charge in the United States and
 you're considered a threat, you're considered a criminal and you're
 considered a threat to the safety of our citizens.” Those are the exact
 words that he said, “You are a threat to our citizens.” And I told him,
 ""Okay, well hold on. I have 20 years here, I have four kids here, my
 brothers are here and my whole family's here. You can't tell me this."" And
 it was literally a one, two, three step process with him. There was no
 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 emotion with him. It was, ""No, this is your option, sign, fight your case.
 But I guarantee you right now that you're not going to win your case.""
      
      
 Angelo: So it was like, ""Why are you giving me the option to fight my case
 if...[Sigh]"" So I told him, ""Okay, well let's sign."" And literally the next
 day, that's when I got deported. And it was just me not wanting to be
 there, seeing everybody at immigration being there three or four years, and
 literally they had more chance of staying than I did. Favors were more on
 their side than they were ever on mine. So I said to myself, ""If they can't
 do it, what makes you think that you're going to be able to stay?"" And that
 was my main decision for me signing the voluntary deportation so I wouldn't
 be incarcerated anymore. I didn't want to be treated as a criminal anymore.
 I never felt like I was a criminal, and I got surrounded with criminals.
      
      
 Angelo: I got surrounded with people that -- I had to change my whole way
 of being. I had to exercise a lot, I had to change my way of being, I had
 to be so cold, so reserved just stay to myself because I didn't want
 anybody to mess with me. I wasn't meant for that. I was meant to be a
 father, I was meant to be a household person, I wasn't meant to be
 imprisoned, and it even got to me and I told myself, “No,” because there
 will be a lot of guards that would tell me, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And
 there will be a lot of times where I would question myself, and I said,
 ""Okay, well your bunkmate, he's here for murder, he's spending here his
 rest of his life, you're getting treated bad. Well, maybe you are a
 criminal, maybe you should just start being a criminal."" And it was just so
 hard for me to stay focused on, ""No, you got to get out of this, you're
 going to get out of this.""
      
      
 Angelo: And at any given moment it would've been so easy for me to just
 explode or something bad to happen, and I just had to concentrate so much
 on just getting through that. Every single time that I got called
 something, it was just put your head down and, ""Okay, no, you're right.""
 And it was like that throughout the whole time of me being in prison and in
 immigration. It was just that, ""You're a dirty Mexican."" And there was
 nothing that you could ever say to them. If you said something to them, it
 was a five-year charge added to you. So it was just keep your mouth shut,
 do what they're telling you, and just keep your head down and stay out the
 way. And that's literally how I survived being in prison. I stuck to myself
 and I didn't mess what anybody.

 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke

 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own

 you never wanted to be.

 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.

 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.

 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just

 literally—

 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.
      
      
 Angelo: I wanted to get beaten down, I wanted for something bad to happen,
 and it was very hard. So whenever they had to break down the door, it was a
 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my

 big eye opener because they had to call my mom, and my mom did not know any
 of this. And my mom's a very big important part of my life, even over there
 she would always help me with stuff. She would always run around with me,
 she would always go shopping with me if I needed anything for my kids, she
 was always right there, if I needed babysitter, she was always right there.
 So whenever they had to call my mom, and they told her, ""You know what,
 your son is doing this"" [Emotional]. That brought so much shame to me, and
 that's when I said, I told my mom, ""I'm sorry, I'm not going to do what my
 father did, so I'm done."" And that was it. That's when I said, ""I'm not
 going to do this again to my mom.""

 this without actually crying or anything like that because I don't want to
 embarrass myself or anything. Yes, it's very literally very hard. Mother’s
 Day, Father’s Day, right now my kids are in birthday season—my kids
 literally have birthdays back to back. So I mean, it's literally hard. My
 first Christmas here, I had no idea it was already Christmas until I saw
 lights. So, I literally just stood in front of them where I was staying—I
 was staying with my uncles—and I just stared at the lights and just broke
 down. And there's many times where that happens to me. There's a car that I
 used to have, or let's say McDonald's or any little thing, a pretty park—I
 walk by a pretty park—and I just picture my kids. So, it's very difficult
 mainly because of my kids. That's all I wanted to be, a father. I want to
 say that I gave them everything. And it's just very hard not being able to,
 for all that work to just be taken away just like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Yeah. I mean especially when you're saying like being a father,
 being a good father and talking about not being able to forgive your own
 father for the way that he treated your mother, being able to rise from
 that, to be the man that you want to be. Not having that figure as a
 father, like knowing you don't want to replicate that.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: And the cruel irony of then still be pictured as that person that
 you never wanted to be.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly. And that was my main goal, just like you said it, that was
 the perfect words. I wanted to be someone that my father was never to me
 and to my family. So, I said “I'm going to be the best father,” and I want
 to say that I was, but it just got taken away. It's very hard because my
 kids right now, they stay with their grandparents—they don't have a father.
 I think to myself on Father's Day at school, what are they making? Who are
 they giving the projects to? My oldest son, he remembers me.
      
      
 Isabel: You mentioned that your return to Mexico was very difficult, you
 had a lot of struggles, like all the alcoholism, also finding a job,
 socially. Do you mind just going into some of the obstacles you ran into on
 your return?
      
      
 Angelo: On my return to Mexico, my very first day here in Mexico, I spent
 the night in on the border, in Tamaulipas, Mexico. And literally I didn't
 want to do anything else. The very first thing I did was go to a store, and
 I bought a beer and I asked the lady at the store, ""Will I get in trouble
 if I walk around the streets with the beer?"" And she said, ""You'll be fine.
 You have two or 300 pesos, right?"" I said, ""Yeah I just came back from the
 United States, I have money."" “You'll be fine, if somebody pulls you over,
 just give them that and you'll be completely fine. “So that was the very
 first thing I did getting here to Mexico. There's so much alcoholism in my
 family that when I got here in Mexico, I said, ""Okay, well it's in my
 blood. Let's go for it."" And literally there will be times where I would
 just go out and buy a vodka bottle and go to my room, buy some orange juice
 and just literally drink until I passed out. And that went on for about
 half a year until one day, I guess I got really sick. I had the hiccups a
 lot that three or four in the morning, I was making too much noise.
      
      
 Angelo: I literally do not remember this, but there were people banging on
 my door trying to get in. Nobody was able to get in, they had to break the
 door down. And from what they told me, I was just in a corner and just
 literally choking on myself, with so much hiccups that, and I was just
 [inaudible]. The next morning and everybody sat down with me, and they
 literally—
      
      
 Isabel: Who’s everybody?
      
      
 Angelo: My uncles. I was staying at my uncle's house, so my uncle's family
 sat down with me, my cousins, and they had to pull me straight. They
 literally said, “You're not right.” They didn't talk to me too much because
 just them saying “You're not all right,” it clicked into my head that it
 was a very, very, very first time that I blacked out drinking, the very,
 very first time. So I told myself, ""How do you not remember this happening?
 How do you not remember any of this? Or why are they telling you this? What
 did you do?"" And I just saw my father all over again, and that was it,
 that's when I stopped drinking on the daily.
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. Because depression is a big part of my life. In the United
 States, I got diagnosed with bipolar depression, so there's just times
 where one time I could be happy, and then I think of something and
 literally my world ends. So getting here to Mexico, that was my escape,
 that was my answer, that was my... I can't say it wasn't the answer because
 for me my goal was to destroy myself, my goal was to get mugged in the
 middle of the street. There would be times where I literally walked around
 the state of Mexico three, four in the morning, just in the middle of the
 street, just looking for trouble. I wanted somebody to find me, I wanted
 somebody to…you know, all these dangerous streets that people were telling
 me, I wanted that, I don't know, I wanted to just destroy myself.

 back onto the bed and then that—
      
      
 Angelo: It was because of that same reason that she did not let me leave
 the room. And so I got her, and I moved her away from the door. I literally
 got her and I tossed her on the bed and that was me not thinking.

 gone. Again, I'm so sorry that it went like that. And thank you for sharing

","Time in the US, Feelings, Tragedy",Angelo
5122,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
","Time in the US, Relationships, Children, Complications, Break-ups, Domestic Abuse, Violence, Feelings, Despair, Tragedy, Arrests, False Accusations",Angelo
5123,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I
 guess start to move into the events that brought you back to Mexico? Just
 going into those in more detail.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. Well, I remember the date perfectly. It was November 12,
 2015. That's the day that me and my baby mama, wife, girlfriend argued. It
 was a very childish argument. Do you want me to go into full details?
      
      
 Isabel: Whatever you're comfortable sharing. I know we talked about this in
 the survey, but we'll just reiterate it.
      
      
 Angelo: Okay. So we started arguing, my girlfriend was a type 2 and was
 that explosive type 2, where she always had to get the last word. And if we
 weren't done arguing, she would continue the argument even if I needed a
 breather, she's, ""No, we got to talk because we have to talk."" And so that
 day it was basically like that. We were arguing, one thing led to another,
 she fell on the bed and my little six month baby went flying. As soon as I
 saw that I tossed myself, and I swooped her up, but—
      
      
 Isabel: Swooped up the baby?
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, but it was too late, her ear hit the floor. Her ear hit the
 floor, and I tossed myself, so I hit a bunch of furniture and bunch of
 stuff fell on top of us. And baby started crying and she wanted to take off
 with my kids—I love my kids to death.
      
      
 Isabel: Kids? So it was the baby, and also?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. I have four kids in total. My oldest kid was barely going into
 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're
 going to get through this. And that was the main reason why we stuck
 together, I would say the last couple of years, because even though we
 didn't have that much love for each other anymore, it was basically we
 loved our kids too much for us to do anything else. And so, she wanted to
 take the kids, so I absolutely didn't let her. There was a point where I
 called the police because after the baby stopped crying, she wanted to put
 her in the car seat, and I told her no. And it got to the point where we
 were literally tugging at the car seat.
      
      
 Angelo: We were playing a tug of war at the car seat with a little baby in
 a car seat. I told my little brothers, ""You know what, I need you to sit
 down and help me."" Because we were alone at the house and I didn't want
 anything to go wrong. So I told my brothers, I need you to help me, I need
 you to sit down right here and see what's going on. Well, I have two
 brothers. I told one, “Sit down and see what's going on.” And I told the
 other one, “I need you to call the police.” I called the police and they
 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts
 your hands on each other, then you can call us.”
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 21 years old. I called the police multiple times, they never
 came. It got to the point where I was sitting in the living room, and out
 of nowhere I see my baby mama grab her things and just take my daughter. I
 had two boys and two daughters. My two boys were the oldest and the two
 daughters were the youngest and the baby of course. And she took the
 toddler, the two-year old, she took her by the hand and left through the
 back door. As soon as she did that, I called the police again and I told
 them, “You know what, this is way out of hand. She's literally taking off
 with my kid, she's out of control. I don't want her to be detained, I don't
 want anything, I just don't want anything to happen to her because she's
 crazy right now, she's super mad and I know her, the way she drives,
 something's going to happen.” They never showed up. I promise you if they
 would've showed up then, anyways—
      
      
 Isabel: No, I‚
      
      
 Angelo: If they would've probably showed up then, the first time that I
 called them, everything probably would have been…I probably wouldn't have
 ended up deported. So, she left with the kid—
      
      
 Isabel: Are the other kids at your house during this time?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. At that point I had told my brothers, ""Take my kids, go watch
 TV and just keep them entertained."" So my wife took off, me and my kids
 spent the afternoon in my mom's house. The next morning, it was around
 seven o'clock in the morning, I took my newborn out to get some sun and I
 was out there talking to my mom. While talking to my mom, she paid
 attention to my little baby and she said, ""She has a bruise."" And I asked
 her where it was because I hadn't seen it and she told me, “It's on her
 ear.” And right away I started putting things together and I said, ""My
 little baby got hurt, something happened."" I didn’t tell my mom at the time
 what had happened, and then I told her, ""What do I do?"" And she said,
 ""Okay, well maybe it's a spider bite. We need to take her to the clinic.""
 We took her to the clinic, as soon as we got to the clinic, all fingers
 were on me. They asked me, ""Where's the mother?"" And I told her, ""Well, the
 mother's not here.""
      
      
 Angelo: ""Well, we need the mother because this is not a spider bite, this
 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control
 the situation or calm it down.
      
      
 Angelo: So, by the time I got to the detective, she did not want to hear my
 side of the story. She said, ""The little baby got hurt, I have four
 children, I'm going to put you behind bars."" My wife got there, they asked
 her what happened and she said, ""It was his fault."" This was around 1:00 AM
 in the morning, I had planned to stay there with my little baby throughout
 the night. I was in the restroom about to take a shower, getting ready to
 lay down. I had already given my keys to my car to my sister because she
 didn't have a way home. So I was literally preparing the water for me to
 take a shower and they knock on the bathroom door, I come out, and they
 said, ""You need to leave the room immediately. You need to leave the
 hospital immediately. And in the morning we're going to have an order for
 your arrest."" And I told them, ""Okay, well hold on. What's going on?"" And
 they said, ""We can't tell you anything, you just can't be around the little
 baby.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told him, ""No, I can't leave. I'm not going to leave my little
 baby."" And they said, ""Okay, well you can leave right now, or I can give
 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,

 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps

 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her

 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",physical,Angelo
5124,text,15591,32213,"Isabel: Yeah. I mean, that's incredible. And it sounds like you're really
 making a life for yourself and for your family in the US. So can we, I

 elementary school, so that was the main reason why we always argue a lot,
 because I told her if my kid's going to start elementary school, he's going
 to stay in one school. We're not going to have him moving around from
 school to school just because we're arguing or just because we have
 problems. If we're going to do this, we're going to be a family, and we're

 told me, “It's a civil argument, we can't do anything until one of you puts

 is a bruise. And we need you right now immediately to take the baby to the
 hospital, and there's no way around that. You need to go right now because
 we have people that are waiting for you."" As soon as I got to the hospital,
 I was greeted by a detective. Literally the whole hospital was running
 around trying to figure out what happened. That detective from the little
 city that I was staying—it was a very little city and very, very, very
 little city. So by all these arguments with my girlfriend, they had already
 gotten to a point to where they knew us. They knew we were a toxic couple,
 there was always things going on, there was always cops needing to control

 you a ride home, if I can give you a ride home, then I'm going to have to
 go ahead and read you your rights."" I didn't know what's going on, with
 them saying that I panicked, and even the hospital ladies were literally
 scared and they didn't know what was going on. And they were on my side and
 they told the police officer, ""No, no, no, hold on, hold on. He doesn't
 have a way home, but we're going to get him a taxi. We're going to get them
 a taxi, we're going to give him the taxi pass and he should be good to go.""
 So they gave me the taxi pass, I went home, nobody showed up the next
 morning. I called them around half the day because by that time, throughout
 the time that I was in the hospital without me knowing, they had already
 went to my house and picked up my other children.
      
      
 Angelo: The next morning, after them telling me to leave the next morning,
 I called the police station and I told him, ""You know what? I need to know
 whether my kids are all right, where they're at, I need to know what's
 going on, I need to know something because you haven't told me anything, I
 don't know where my kids are at, I don't know if they're with their mother,
 I literally don't know anything. I need you to tell me something."" And they
 told me somebody will get in contact with you soon. I spent a month
 waiting. I was working, I came home, my mom was crying on the couch and she
 told me that they had an order for my arrest and I told her, ""Okay, well
 what's next?"" And she said, ""I don't know son.""
      
      
 Angelo: I told her, ""Okay, well I'm going to go tomorrow and I'm going to
 see what's going on."" The next morning, I was on my way to the police
 station, I was walking because obviously I didn't want to take my car. So I
 was walking to the police station, it was a couple blocks away. When I was
 walking towards there, I guess they had went some other way where they
 hadn't seen me, but the police were going to my house and they didn't see
 me walk into the police station. So they went to my house and they asked my
 mom, ""Where's he at?"" And she said, ""He's walking to the police station as
 we speak."" Literally it was like, I was the biggest terrorist in the world.
 They closed down the streets, they put fire trucks, they had detectives,
 and literally they greeted me with, ""Mr ____, how are you doing?""
      
      
 Angelo: So hypocritical because after them saying that they threw me on
 their hood and put cuffs on me, and I was literally in front of the police
 station when they did this. So a town so small, everybody saw, all the
 neighbors, schools, everybody saw. And I was like, ""Really? I'm literally
 in front of police station. Why are you doing all this?"" And I was just the
 biggest terrorist at that time. And I'm getting into jail, they told me
 that I was being charged with serious bodily injury because it turns out
 that in her ear she had a little bit of internal bleeding, and they weren't
 sure if that was going to affect her or not. Thankfully she was only at the
 hospital for one day, but I didn't know that, I had no idea.
      
      
 Angelo: So literally it took them about a month for them to build their
 police report. Once I got to read the police report, it made no sense
 whatsoever. The detective literally twisted my words because once the
 detective was at the hospital asking me questions, she asked me, ""Who did
 this?"" And I told her, ""You know what? I know how this goes, my mom works
 for the state. My mom has her own daycare."" Me and my mom went to the
 clinic, me and my mom came to the hospital. If at any time I was going to
 think, ""Hey, you know what, maybe I'm in trouble. I would have given the
 baby to my mom and I would have not presented myself, but I'm here with my
 baby. I have my baby in my arms, this is my life. You can't tell me that
 you're going to put the blame on me. I wouldn't be here if I feel any type
 of guilt."" So on the police report it said Angelo ____ brought the baby to
 the hospital because he feels guilty.
      
      
 Angelo: And so that was a done deal. Once I got into prison, got my lawyer,
 there was a pretty good chance of me fighting it. First three months, I
 presented myself to the court. Well, they took me to the court because I
 was already detained and my first offer was 30 years. They told me 30 years
 or fight your case. Ended up waiting six months, and they went down to 25
 years, ended up waiting a couple of more months, they didn't go down at all
 until my lawyer said, ""This is where we're at. You want to protect your
 wife so much, you love her so much, you don't want her to go to jail,
 you're planning to throw away your life, 25 years.” She literally took out
 her phone and showed me a picture of my wife in Miami with some other dude,
 and then—
      
      
 Isabel: Where are the kids?
      
      
 Angelo: With their grandparents. And then I told my lawyer, ""Let's go to
 trial, I'm going to fight this."" The next day the state called me, and they
 said, “We're going to offer you three years.” And I told my lawyer, ""Okay.
 So what's going to happen?"" She said, ""You've already done nine months.
 You've got to do a couple of more months and you'll be good to go."" And I
 said, ""Okay, well, I'm not going to put the mother of my kids behind bars,
 I'm never going to do that ever in a million years, no matter whatever
 she's done, I'm not going to be the person to do that."" So I said, ""Okay,
 I'm going to do a couple of more months, it seems that I have an
 immigration bond, so I should be good to go."" As soon as I got to prison,
 immigration bond was gone. I got my papers for deportation and my road
 ended because I thought a couple of more months and the nightmare is over.
 But I ended up being deported.
      
      
 Isabel: That's just like a series of people twisting and it does sound
 exactly like a nightmare. I'm so sorry that that happened.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: I totally get what you're saying. Like, “If I'm here and I'm
 carrying my baby, if I was guilty, why in the world would I be here?” Like
 there's so many steps that I feel like for me so clearly indicate you not
 being guilty. I think it does kind of get back to problems with US
 authorities and the immigration services where it's like obviously you're
 undocumented, or they see that you're Mexican, they're going to assume and
 paint the picture they want even if you in no way fit that picture that
 they want. And it's so out of your hands because they have all the power in
 these situations.
      
      
 Angelo: Exactly.
      
      
 Isabel: I just really want to clarify your story for this, in the
 altercation with your girlfriend or wife, when the baby was on the bed and
 she was trying to leave with her. And you were saying, ""Please don't,
 you're not leaving with my children."" Like, when you said you're in a toxic
 relationship. Did it also get physical sometimes?
      
      
 Angelo: It got physical. It got physical because there were points where
 she would stand at the door and that's the only time it got physical
 because she would get hit by the door. I would try to pull the door and she
 literally stand there and, I insist, and pull the door even harder. There
 was one time where we were playing tug of war with the door, and I let the
 door go and out of nowhere I just see lights—I see lights. Yeah, she hit
 me, she hit me in my eye. And I grew up with my dad being an alcoholic, I
 grew up seeing that happen to my mom. Even to this day, I can't forgive my
 dad. Me and my dad, we can say we love each other, but I will never forget
 that.
      
      
 Angelo: So that was always in my mind. I have a sister, I have a mom, I'm
 never going to touch a woman. So whenever I saw lights, I was like, ""Okay,
 that's going to make you feel better, go ahead."" So at first, she started
 slapping me and then I saw lights because she punched me in my eye. As soon
 as she punched me in my eye, I was like, ""Okay, okay, okay. it's not slaps
 anymore, you're out of control."" I held her, she was facing the wall, she
 bit me. She bit me so hard that I literally I threw her, I literally let go
 and she hit the wall. She hit the wall and I think she said she bit her
 lip, I'm not sure what the police officer said, but she ended up spitting
 up blood because at that point she told me, “Get out of the house.”
      
      
 Angelo: And at that point, we were living by ourselves and I told her,
 “This is my house, I'm paying rent, there's no way I'm leaving. You can go
 to your room, I'll stay in the living room, I'm not going anywhere.” So she
 picked up the phone to call the police, at the same time I picked up the
 phone to call the police. And so we were both on the line with the police.
 I waited outside for the police, I waved them down. I literally waved them
 down and I told them, ""Hey, you know what, this is what happened."" They
 took pictures of my eye, they took pictures of the bite, and at the end of
 the day it was my fault because a woman got hurt. So that was the only
 point it ever got to a physical altercation.
      
      
",conflict,Angelo
5125,text,9192,15590,"Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.

 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.
      
      
 Isabel: So you said you were 16, so did you say you were older when you
 were renting a house or an apartment or anything that you'd pretend?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes, when I was 16, I had to get fake IDs, fake social security
 cards, and so that's how I got my apartment. Even 16, I looked older than
 what I was, so it was really no problem for me to apply for an apartment,
 or anything like that.
      
      
 Isabel: Did the restaurants that you would work with or the people there
 know that you were undocumented or that are younger?
      
      
 Angelo: No.
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were becoming the chef?
      
      
 Angelo: 16.
      
      
 Isabel: That's incredible. I'm learning how to like... the other day I
 Googled how to cook chicken [Both laugh].
      
      
 Angelo: It was very difficult, but I wanted to do that. I saw my father,
 and I wanted to be him. I wanted to be him.
      
      
 Isabel: So, I'm just still trying to wrap my head around this. So, I know
 you started at Applebee's, but when you started at the last restaurant you
 work for, it was this like English, British kind of style. It's more on the
 other ends of the Applebee's spectrum?
      
      
 Angelo: Oh very.
      
      
 Isabel: Very much like more high end?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: How old were you when you were a chef for that restaurant?
      
      
 Angelo: I was 20, 21 years old.
      
      
 Isabel: So that's kind of like where your career span…still so incredibly
 young. So how old did they think you were when you were working for them?
      
      
 Angelo: Then I could say I was 21.
      
      
 Isabel: Okay, so then that's fine.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah.
      
      
 Isabel: That's enough credit.
      
      
 Angelo: Yeah, by then they knew who I was. There was points where I would
 get called in from other stores and they would tell me, “Leave where you're
 at and we'll give you $3 more.” Literally, I've never made minimum wage.
 And so that's basically how about how I got to $15.50 at the end. The
 reason I went to the British restaurant was because I was at Applebee's,
 and me and my dad would bump heads. He was the top chef, and I would also
 be considered the top chef. So whenever we would work shifts, it was all
 like, ""Okay, so who's in charge?""
      
      
 Isabel: Literally too many cooks in the kitchen.
      
      
 Angelo: So that's when I said, ""Okay, well I got to be on my own. I got to
 do my own thing.: And thank God I was able to do it. I put my mind to it
 and I got my name out there.
      
      
",father-son,Angelo
5128,text,9192,15590,"Isabel: And you said you became a chef—you started at Applebee's—can you
 tell me what the restaurant experience was like becoming a chef and moving
 around from there?
      
      
 Angelo: Well, when we first got to the U.S , my dad got into construction
 and so after a few years he got tired of that physically—it was very
 physically demanding—so he got into the restaurant. By the time I was 16,
 he had already had his status. He was a very good cook, so he brought me
 along. I was under his training from then on. I got that spark again, to
 want to do something, because I saw everybody, how they treated my dad, and
 literally just because I had his last name, it was, ""Okay, you got the
 job."" And my dad was at a very prestigious level to where many people would
 call him offering jobs or—
      
      
 Isabel: Your dad was undocumented as well?
      
      
 Angelo: Yes. When I saw that, I was like, ""Okay, I might not be able to go
 to college, but maybe I could become a manager, maybe I could have my own
 kitchen, maybe I could have my own store, my own restaurant."" And so being
 under my dad's training gave me that spark. I overpassed my dad, there were
 points after three years in a restaurant where I wasn't my dad's son
 anymore, I was my own person. I could go up to people and they would be
 like, ""Yeah, I know who you are."" At first it was all like, ""Okay, who are
 you?"" “Well, I'm ____ son.” “Oh wow. Okay, well here you go.” But then
 after a while it was, ""Okay, well we need you because we've heard of you
 and we need you to pick our store back up."" And so after that, that was my
 goal to have a restaurant, my own restaurant.
      
      
 Isabel: What was your favorite restaurant to work at?
      
      
 Angelo: That's very difficult, but I would probably say Applebee's just
 because that's where I started, and it just brings so much memories of me
 learning, me getting that experience, me burning myself a lot. And so yeah,
 that was probably the best time of my life, working at Applebee's.
      
      
 Isabel: Even though you went on to surpass your father?
      
      
 Angelo: [Affirmative noise].
      
      
 Isabel: It's really cool. So, you have kind of like this going…Start
 pursuing cooking and kind of earning that prestige or going after your
 father. But then you also mentioned that you're doing this because you had
 to support a family. Were you living with your baby's mother at the time?
 Were you together?
      
      
 Angelo: Well it was very difficult because at the age of 16, my father had
 legal problems. He ended up going away for, I would say, half a year-a
 little bit more than half a year. Throughout that time, there was a point
 where I had to basically become the man of the house. My mom doesn't drive,
 so I would take her to her job and I would bring her back. There was many
 times where I had to drive at three or four in the morning. So at the age
 of 16, I wanted to become that. I wanted to become that man of the house.
 And really that's the main reason why I had my baby, because I said, “I
 could do this, I want this, I want to be a father, and I'm going to be a
 father.”
      
      
 Angelo: And so, at the age of the age of 16, I moved out of my parents'
 house. After three months of working, I moved out of my parents' house, got
 my own apartment. And I ended up working two jobs at a time to be able to
 support my family and be on my own. After a while it was very difficult.
 So, there were plenty of times where we'd be on our own, and then something
 bad would happen financially, and so we'd go back to our parents' house. It
 was just basically on and off being on our own and not being able to make
 it.

 got a reward and I was asked to go to Nevada to receive the reward in front
 of a bunch of people. The website was legit—it was if you search poetry on
 Google, it was the very first one that came up. It was even to a point
 where you search my name and my poem came up. I got a mail certificate
 inviting me to Nevada, Las Vegas, Nevada to receive that reward. I ran
 around the house; I told my sister. But at the end of the day, it was that

 school, I was all about school. I was in honors, AP classes, all of that.
 There was a point where one of my teachers—one of my reading
 teachers—basically just had me by myself because whatever she was teaching
 wasn't enough for me. She had me on a college level reading. I forgot the
 book, The Count of Monte Cristo? The Count of Monte Cristo.

 still had a drinking problem so there was a few times where authorities had
 to be called. And many of those times, it was basically the road was ending
 because my dad was going to get deported and we were going to be left
 alone. It was basically family running around crying. I saw that many
 times. So, whenever I started getting to the age of into peer pressuring or
 I would have a friend that said, ""Let's go do this,"" I'll be, ""No, I'm
 going to get in trouble."" Or, ""No, I'm going to get deported, I'm not from
 here."" And even in school, that was a major discrimination because we had
 Chicanos—which would be Hispanics that grew up in the United States, that
 were born there—and then we had the Wetbacks. And so that's what I was
 always considered. And even with Latinos, I was always discriminated, ""Oh I
 have papers, you don't have papers, you're a Wetback."" And so that was
 very, very, very difficult for me.

5162,text,1795,2593,"Angelo: I remember going to school, it was very scary for me because I
 didn't know the language. There were many times where I would just cry. The
 teachers would try to comfort me, but I would just scream—I didn't know
 what was going on. Even times when I was in pain, I couldn't tell anybody
 what was going on. So it was very difficult. I did have one friend, and
 that was my closest friend. I was very young, so it was like I needed that,
 to have somebody support me. You know, obviously my parents were there, but
 maybe they spent more time trying to get them situated, and not really
 introducing us to the American life. So it was, basically go to school,
 you're on your own and then come back in your home. So it was basically
 like I had to learn everything by myself.

   to provide for my kids, because sometimes there wouldn't be people that
   wanted tattoos, or there wouldn't be people that wanted a haircut.

   invited me to go with one of her friends because they had a hotel in a

   make her happy.

   try it, just because I'm trying to make her happy."" And that's the day I
   got caught up with the blunt in my ear and the security caught me. From
   there on, I had to go to court fighting the cases and then basically I just
   like—

   It's just like a cigar. Have you seen this Cuban cigar? That's what it is.
   All they do is they cut it in the middle and they put weed inside. That's
   what a blunt is.
 
 
   Anne: How did they find it?
 
 
   Mike: I had it in my ear when I was coming out of the—there was a hotel and
   the casino and in the middle they joined and in that middle part there is
   security. So I was walking out going to the casino and they seen it in my
   ear and they're like, ""What is that?"" And I was like, ""Aw damn, I'm done.""
   I knew it so I was like, ""Dude, I'm done.""

   then they told me that I had a court date. Little did I know in the next
   two days somebody came to pick me up from ICE, so I had to go with them.
   They placed me there for a couple of days, more. Two or three days more. I
   stayed in the ICE facility for two or three days and then they let me out
   and then that's when I had to go to court. Keep going to court. Keep going
   to court until finally I couldn't stall it anymore.
 
 
   Mike: So they were like, ""Dude, you got to do something. You either going
   to jail or to fight it, the case. But you're going to jail. You've got to
   be in jail and you can't be out while you're fighting this case, or you do
   a voluntary departure and you go."" At that time I felt like I wasn't any
   good to anybody. I didn’t want to be a burden on my family."" So I just
   left. This is just something that I felt like I had to do. I knew if I ran
   away, I was never going to be able to provide for my kids, because I was
   always going to have to try to find a way to provide for myself. And I
   didn't want that for them. So I just did a voluntary departure. I just
   said, ""Screw it.""

   care for themselves. I remember walking into my friend's house and the
   house was just like, ""Oh my God."" It was like a tornado went in and I
   usually don't hang out with people like this. I was so scared just being in

   ""Okay if you're not ish, then I'm not an ish either.""

   me. The streets adopted me kind of in a way. I didn't really have a

   felt like an outcast. I would never go to them. Christmas, I was always in

   chips, whatever."" So I go in the store and the guy was really nice. He was
   an Arab guy. He was always telling me, ""Hey, just pay me back tomorrow.""
 
 
   Mike: And I had remembered he had already done that. He gave me a bag of
   chips, and he just told me, ""Pay me back whenever you come."" So I was like,
   ""Dude, I can't do that again, because I don't have no money this time""
   [Emotional]. So I remember I prayed to God. I prayed to God. I was like,
   ""Please God help me. I don't want to steal from this man. He's really good
   guy."" And, oh dude, this is crazy, because I look in my pocket—I had the
   chips in my hand and I was acting like I had money. Sure enough, I reached
   in my pocket, and I had a dollar. A freaking dollar. I was like, ""God I
   know you're real."" Because at that time I was like, ""Yeah."" But I got home,
   opened the little bag, put some lime, put some hot sauce, feed my little
   brothers and sisters.
 
 
   Mike: Then I'm telling you, we were so hungry that I had some seeds, some
   plants—the garden seeds and stuff. I went outside thinking that they were
   going to grow in a couple of days. I made myself a little garden, I was
   planting them, and I was like, ""Please, God..."" When I was praying, I was
   like, ""Please God, let me get this food so I can feed my brothers and
   sisters, because I don't know when my dad is going to come.” And right when
   I look up, I see two officers. A lady and then a man. They said they were
   US Marshalls or something like that. They took us.
 
 
   Mike: We stayed with them for a couple of days, and then they flew us back
   to Arizona where my mom was staying at. So yeah, those two years being away
   from her, my dad had lied to us and said that she didn't want us anymore
   because she had another kid on the way. And yeah, my dad didn't care. He
   just lied to us and said that my mom didn't want us.
 
 
   Mike: So, I was thinking like, ""Why do you want us back? You say you didn't
   want us.” Little did I know all that. She told me all this stuff that
   happened and I just started busting down and crying. And I was always mean
   to my little stepsister too. But once I learned about how my dad, when she
   was a newborn, put her in the closet with my mom—got my mom butt naked and
   put her in the closet—and left her there and then took us to Texas… I used

   that, oh, I'm hearing you don't have the right to be here. But if they
   lived even a quarter of what the migrant families lived, they would think
   completely different. It's not nice driving around the city and getting
   held up at gunpoint with your family and kids in the car, getting told to
   get out of the car and leave. Because one of my uncles actually got killed
   that way. He had his five kids in his truck. It was a brand-new truck. He
   was very excited because he had barely been able to buy it. He was outside
   of the house, he loaded the kids in the truck, and he was going to go out
   with them, and a couple of guys came up to the window and were like, ""Get
   out of the truck. Leave the truck. We want the truck"" at gunpoint. And he
   was like, ""Let me get my kids out at least. You can take the truck, but my
   kids are in the car."" And they just didn't care and they shot him down in
   the truck. He died a couple of minutes after he got shot in the leg and I
   guess it went through one of his primary arteries. And he died because he
   didn't want to give up the truck with his kids in it.

   where they had that program. They had marine biology there, so it was
   pretty cool. We had a lot of fish tanks and we were able to see a lot of
   things. Our school offered scuba diving lessons for free, they would take

 me or the States gave me. The reality is that English is a very valued
 asset here. I'm not sure, I think around the world, eventually, because it
 has become the global language. So 10 years ago, when I first arrived and
 nine years ago, when I first started looking for a job and such, that's
 pretty much what sold me or what... I had zero prior experience minus the
 bakery, and I didn't even mention it because it wasn't even... Really, if I
 remember correctly, I don't know if it was just one or two weekends, but I
 didn't like it. So I was like, ""I'm not doing this."" And without any
 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always
 tell you, ""we are hiring people,"" but it's only people with experience. So
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the
 supermarkets and such and people obviously wouldn't hire me. I couldn't
 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a
 big no. And it wasn't until funnily enough, my mom, who was the one who
 found out about call centers here. And she asked one of my cousins to take
 me to one, and that's how I got my first job.

 going for what you want and not being rude about it, but just trying to get
 your point across without hurting others.

 experience at all, it's hard to get a job. It's funny because they always
 tell you, ""we are hiring people,"" but it's only people with experience. So
 all of that is hard, but English sold me in the first and only job I went
 to for that. Aside from the fact that when I first got here, my Spanish was
 horrible. So many of the jobs that I initially started applying to were
 over-the-counter jobs. So it was like Blockbuster, when it existed, or the

 even have a conversation in my interview because of my Spanish. So it was a

 that your vitals are normal, or your vitals are stable. I think that's the

 I have an older sister, my older sister and I. And then we were moved to
 the elementary school where we finished our studies. I remember my
 childhood in terms of like school and friends and such, but the first
 memories of arriving there, I don't recall.
      
      
 Isabel: Can you tell me about then your childhood, both your schools and
 your friends?
      
      
 Ana: Yeah. I don't remember much about my bilingual school. I just remember
 that we were there a year, then in the other school where we finished. I
 remember the school itself, the physical-ness of it, the weather. I
 remember that I was a huge nerd. [Laughs]. I just focused on reading and
 doing my schoolwork and finishing school and, yeah.

 Ana: Yeah, my fifth-grade teacher, Mr. Ogami, really, really great in
 teaching Math and such and books. And I remember my mom liked him also,
 because of the program of the school, getting work done and memorizing
 stuff. So yeah, he would definitely stand out.

   brother from my stepdad and my mom. And I'm 11 years older than him. He's
   21 right now, just a baby. At the moment I'm like, “Why would you kick me
   out? I'm 15 years old.” But then I see it and I see they couldn't be around
   that. They would see that lifestyle. I was making a lot of money, so they
   would see that lifestyle, and, of course, everybody as a human being wants
   to go the easy way. They don't want to struggle. If my sister would've saw
   that, God knows what she would have been like. Or my little brother
   would've saw that, God knows where he would have ended up too.
 
 
   Anita: What was the attraction for you of the gangs?
 
 
   Donovan: I don't know. Just respect more than anything. Just having people
   back you up. Just not ever feeling scared, not even feeling vulnerable.
   Make sure that you always have—we were actually the only family that went
   to the State; all my other family's right here, so I never had a family
   over there—like a family intuition, and also just having people around yo","Gangs, Affiliation, Camaraderie / family, Family, Fitting in, Activity",Donovan

   Back then hip hop was really not a thing. It was bad. If you listened to

   Zayuri: What else? I mean, it's hard, really hard trying to leave
   everything. For example, my dad, I remember that he told us, ""Don't even
   get too attached to your friends because you don't know if tomorrow we're
   still going to be here."" So, it was like, “That's nice advice for my first
   day to school. Thank you. I'll make the best that I can with that.” So, I
   remember, that even talking to people for me was like, “What's the point?
   Am I going to see you next week? Probably not.”?

   Zayuri: To anyone, even on a friendship level. I was like, ""What's the
   point?"" For example, I could never had friends over because my dad didn't
   even like us to share the address. Because we were living on part that was
   full of other migrants, so he was like, ""No, there's no gringos coming out
   to this area. You don't know how they're going to react. If something
   happens to them, and they're in the whole right to do it, but they try to
   call the police, you don't know what kind of problems we can get into.""
   That was like, ""Okay. So, no friends over. Can I go to other friends?"" ""No.
   No, no, no, no, no."" So, you'd have to have McDonald's and go back here
   before sunset. All right. And that was the way to go. [Interview ends

14195,text,15376,19602,"Zayuri: Yeah, it was really annoying, because, for example, a couple of
   months ago, like two months ago, I got robbed here. That whole day was such
   a bad day for me. I don't remember much; I just remember the downhill of
   it. I went to a cineteca, and I had two phones by this time. I will say
   that one was mostly for work, it was very simple, it didn't even have a
   nice camera or anything. That phone had been in the family for like four
   years. It was first the phone of one of my uncles. Then he gave it to my
   grandma, and my grandma gave it to me. And it was still working. It had a
   couple of malfunctions, but it was working. That was my phone.
 
 
   Zayuri: Then I had a nice one that I bought with my savings because of the
   camera, because I wanted to take pictures and everything. On that day, I
   went to the cineteca, I went to the bathroom, and I dropped the one that
   was for my work and everything. I dropped it, and the screen just turned
   black. I was like, ""Okay, this is not good."" It did turn off. It did turn
   on, and I can hear it, but I didn't saw anything at all. I was like,
   ""Okay."" So, I was like, ""It's not a big deal. I still have the nice one. I
   could just live with just one. That will be okay."" I was trying to not pay
   that much attention to that.
 
 
   Zayuri: So, I was walking around, trying to get a couple of pictures. It
   wasn't even that late at night. It was like 9:00. There was still a couple
   of just people walking around because it was in [inaudible]. I was like,
   ""Yeah, this is okay."" I was trying to be calm because I still had the thing
   for the phone. I was like, ""Yeah, it's not that bad. I still have this
   one."" Then I got robbed. They took that phone—
 
 
   Isabel: In the same day?
 
 
   Zayuri: Yeah. They took that phone away, and they took my money. Then I saw
   a couple of police officers, and I told them—because he wasn't even
   running, the person who took my stuff. He was walking. I was like, ""Yeah,
   he just robbed me. Could you do something about it?"" And they didn't
   believe me because I had the other phone. So, they thought that I was
   trying to scam him. They were like, ""Yeah? He took your phone? And why do
   you have one right there?"" And I was like, ""I can prove that they're both
   mine. I can unlock that one, and I can show you the pictures on it,
   whatever you ask me."" They told me that they couldn't—how do you call that?
 
 
   Isabel: Pat down or legally search?
 
 
   Zayuri: They couldn't do that. I was like, ""Yes, you can. I'm pretty sure

   anything about it."" I was like, ""Okay. I think I'm going to leave right
   now."" I didn't have any money with me, and my Uber with my credit card was
   on that phone. I was like, ""I don't know how am I going to get to my
   house,"" and I was really, really far away from my house. I was like, ""Okay,
   can you guys take me there?"" I said that to the police officers. They were
   like, ""No. We don't go that far. We just have to stay in our area."" I was
   like, ""So, what do I do now?"" They were like, ""Take a taxi."" I was like,

   officers, I was like, ""Yes! I'm going to get my things again!"" I didn't
   even care if he went to jail or anything. I just really wanted my stuff,
   and I told them right there, “I don't care if he goes to court or if
   anything. I just want my stuff back. That's it. I'm not even going to press
   charge. I just really want my stuff. I need it. That's my phone, and that
   is my nice phone.”
 
 
   Isabel: You bought with your own money.
 
 
   Zayuri: The other one is broke. They didn't care. I remember I just got to
   the house, and I said to my roommate... She was like, ""What happened? You
   look so sad."" I was like, ""Yeah, I didn't have a nice day. We'll talk about
   it in the morning."" I just went to sleep. And in the morning, I was crying
   with her, and she was like, ""What happened?"" I was like, “I don’t know
   where to start” [Mimics crying]. That was really traumatizing in the
   beginning.

   really good at math and didn't care, didn't like it.

",Time in the US,Axel

 confidence that I didn't with my parents to tell them, and I want them to
 have that confidence with me and I would let my kids do it in the house, in
 the backyard, whatever, but somewhere where I know they're going to be
 safe, instead of like with me and my mom, I would have to go hiding around,
 go in the streets where it was more dangerous because somebody could see
 me, cops could see me. All these other stuff, and I'm okay with all that
 stuff. I'm okay if my kids want to do it, they want to try it out. All
 right.
      
      
 Axel: If things get out of hand, obviously I would come down to them, but
 at the end, I just want to see them happy. I want to see them grow, want to
 help them become who they're going to be, I want them to grow up and be
 able to say that I was there for them. Even my daughters, even though I'm
 not over there, I want them to be able to... Even though right now, that's
 why I take that as a big priority in my life to buy stuff for them, so that
 they could say, ""Hey, your dad's never there."" He's like, ""No, but he's
 always helped. He's not there physically, but he's there when I need him
 emotionally. When I need anything clothes wise, he's always providing me
 that type of stuff. Maybe he wasn't there physically, but he is somebody in
 my life important.""
      
      
 Axel: And that's always still be my dream. Right now, I separated with my
 wife that I have because she wants to work, but due to the kids and I don't
 have any family here, her family lives about an hour and a half away from
 here, nobody could take care of the kids so she was a stay at home mom. We
 weren't missing anything, we were actually living pretty good, but she just
 felt like she needed to do more for the family. She felt like the kids were
 going to grow up and be like, ""Oh yeah, dad was always the one that did
 everything. He's the one that get the money."" She's like, ""I want to feel
 like I did my part. Sometimes I want to buy them something out of my own
 heart and I want them to know that it's something that I did for them.""
      
      
 Axel: I was like, ""Yeah, you don't have to say that it's my part or
 anything like that. I don't ask for any of that. Imma buy them my own
 stuff."" She's like, ""No, but I just still feel like it's difficult."" So
 right now, we're separated, but we're still talking, we're trying to fix
 things out. I want to fix it too, because they say third time is the charm,
 and I understand my mom too at the same time like, ""Hey, you don't want to
 go and have another baby with another girl. That's going to be four. How do
 you plan on maintaining? You got two over here, you got one over there.""

 here, moved in a place around here. That's where my family is at. I don't
 have any family right here. No cousins, siblings, nothing. When I was over
 there, since I had first got there, I was struggling. I didn't have a
 phone. My grandparents, obviously, they're not big on phones with internet,
 anything like that. So I didn't have contact with my baby for about maybe a
 year or so, because I could do a phone call every now and then, but the
 minutes and stuff, since it was a little place, you had to go buy a card
 with minutes to call. Once the card was over, you had to buy another card
 or they had to pay and it wasn't good.
      
      
 Axel: All of a sudden, my baby went from being a baby to now she's a little
 young toddler, walking around, speaking little words and for me, it's
 always been my dream to have my family and be like my mom was. Maybe I'm
 not going to be able to have all the things my mom had and things my mom
 provided us, but I want to get as close as I can to something like that and
 be able to provide my kids all I can. I don't care if I'm missing
 something, but as long as my kids are happy and my family has what they
 need, like I said, like my mom said, I care more about other people than

   testing me if to keep me on third grade, or going back to first grade. I
   did good. My grades were good. You know what? Kept them there when I

   in trouble. We're in a gang."" I really don't remember the name of the gang.

   Mexicans, also some from the States. I hanged out with them for a long
   time, but I didn't notice in that time, but it started getting, doing bad
   things and stuff like that. One day we were playing out, one of them had a
   car. One of them had a car. I remember it was a Corvette. An old one,
   though. Not like the one they have here, right?
 
 
   Anne: Yeah, cool.
 
 
   Carlos: Yeah. What basically got me in trouble was me being with them,
   because we were just hanging out. Supposedly, I thought we were just
   hanging out in the car and taking them for a ride, but what they did is go
   rob a pharmacy. I remember it was a Walgreens pharmacy. Everything went
   bad. In that instance, I didn't know what was happening. I thought they
   just wanted to buy something. The police came, and I got in trouble. There
   was some snitching there because the friend that was with the car, I think
   he found out about something and he left. I was with them.
 
 
   Carlos: That happened to be troublesome for me because one of them
   snitched, and they pointed out that I was there, too. Basically, I didn't
   do nothing bad, but I was at the wrong place and in the wrong moment, so
   that got me, a bad decision to me and everything, and all that happened.

 up here?
      
      
 Brenda: Probably. Sometimes I have very optimistic ideas about certain
 things. I think that—not as a judgment towards anyone—I'm a good kid over
 there. Sometimes a lot of it was because of fear of if you get in trouble.
 You need to hang out with good kids, and you can't be like … I was always
 told not to hang out with other Hispanic kids because eventually too many
 of us would make people nervous or something. So, don't do that. Don't get
 into trouble. All of these things made me a very anxious person growing up.
 But I was always like, “No, because if something happens to me or the
 police were to find me for whatever I might be doing, apparently, it would
 involve everybody. We'd all be in trouble.” Here I think I would still do
 the same because up until a couple of years ago my grandpa was like, “You
 can't go out.” I'd be like, “Okay.” I'm still very obedient. All right, I
 don't want to get in trouble, and I don't want to get into arguments with
 anyone.
      
      
 Brenda: I just do as I'm told. I think it would've been similar, but maybe
 have … I don't know, I probably would have started working a lot younger
 helping my family out and such. Over there because I couldn't work, it was
 mainly to stay in at home babysitting my siblings. I think those kinds of
 things, I wasn't as exposed to a lot of the world as I was—or am now, here.
